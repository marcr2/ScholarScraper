Therefore, the usual adjuvant treatments for breast cancer, are not applied to TNBC. Recently, it has been found that approximately one third of TNBC tumours express androgen receptor (AR) and it is associated with better response to endocrine therapies. However, the prognostic value of AR expression in TNBC is still unclear. Therefore, in this preliminary study we evaluate the effectiveness of an anti-androgen treatment (bicalutamide) respect to conventional treatments (doxorubicin and lapatinib) in TNBC human cell lines and their corresponding xenografts. Briefly, SUM149, SUM159 and MDAMB231 TNBC cell lines were cultured in supplemented medium. Cells were plated in 96-well plates and a serial dilution of Doxorubicin, Lapatinib, Bicatulamide and respective combinations were added. In addition, 106 cells were implanted subcutaneosly into five female mice (Balb/C SCID). When tumors developed, mice were treated with doxorubicin, bicalutamide, doxorubicin + bicalutamide and doxorubicin + bicalutamide + lapatinib. Every treatment was perfomed every 3 days during 15 days and tumor reduction and appearance of metastases were evaluated. Results from cell culture showed that neoplasic cells from each cell line were high sensitive to bicalutamide treatment (SUM149 EC50: 9,860e009; MDAMB231 EC50: 9,454e009; SUM159 EC50: 2,170e009). Also, viability decreased when we added an anti-androgen (bicalutamide) to the conventional treatments (doxorubicin + lapatinib). In vivo experiments revealed a greater percentage of tumour reduction (around 70%) in mice treated with combination of treatments and a lower appearance of metastasis was observed in this group respect to control group (SUM149: 40% vs 60%; MDA-MB-231: 20% vs 75%; SUM159: 20% vs 60%). Therefore, our preliminary findings suggest that the addition of an anti-androgenic agent to treatments currently in use can reduce the tumour considerably, defining anti-androgenic treatments as a novel effective therapeutic target.

This group experiences a 40% higher mortality rate compared to women of other ethnicities, highlighting a significant disparity, and underscoring the urgent need for the development of targeted, effective treatments, specifically tailored to address these demographic women. Towards this, the efficacy of high intensity, short duration electrical pulses combined with Resveratrol (Resv), a natural polyphenol, as a novel therapeutic agent against TNBC is investigated. Electrical pulses facilitate enhanced drug transport through the opening of pores in cell membrane for those molecules that are normally non-permeable. This approach addresses the challenge of Resv's limited bioavailability and enhances its apoptotic potential. Employing MDA-MB-468 cell line, derived from an African American woman, this study investigates the effects of Resv and electrical pulses (EP) on TNBC cells. The TNBC cells were treated with Resv and subjected to eight pulses of multiple electric fields ranging from 500V/cm to 1200V/cm at 100μs, and at 1Hz, followed by assessments monitoring viability, colony formation, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The results indicate an 84% reduction in live cancer cell viability and a 4-fold increase in ROS levels with the combined treatment, suggesting a promising approach to alternative TNBC therapy. This research evaluates a natural bio compound, along with an advanced drug delivery system, targeting a reduction in mortality rates and improved quality of life for TNBC patients."

However, we are now witnessing the dawn of targeted therapies for TNBC in which progress has stemmed from an improved understanding of the components that make TNBC unique. The identification of biomarkers, such as BRCA1/2, PIK3CA and RSK2, have advanced the field remarkably and there is considerable interest in finding novel therapeutics for TNBC that offer durable clinical benefit with fewer adverse events. Areas covered We discuss phase I/II trials of new and emerging targeted therapies for TNBC, according to ClinicalTrials.gov up to June 2020. Although the emphasis is on ongoing and completed early phase trials, we also highlight pivotal studies that have led to the approval of new targeted classes of drugs for TNBC, with a focus on outcomes and common adverse events of each class of therapy. Expert opinion The way forward for TNBC treatment is through precision medicine. The use of novel agents matched with biomarkers to identify patients with the best chance of sustainable response offers new hope. We now have great potential for improving the outcomes for patients with TNBC."
Breast Cancer Treatments: Updates and New Challenges,"[{'authorId': '1768761399', 'name': 'Anna Burguin'}, {'authorId': '34913310', 'name': 'C. Diorio'}, {'authorId': '3586181', 'name': 'F.

This heterogeneous disease can be classified into four molecular subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER2 and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)) according to the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) and the progesterone receptor (PR), and the overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Current BC treatments target these receptors (endocrine and anti-HER2 therapies) as a personalized treatment. Along with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, these therapies can have severe adverse effects and patients can develop resistance to these agents. Moreover, TNBC do not have standardized treatments. Hence, a deeper understanding of the development of new treatments that are more specific and effective in treating each BC subgroup is key. New approaches have recently emerged such as immunotherapy, conjugated antibodies, and targeting other metabolic pathways. This review summarizes current BC treatments and explores the new treatment strategies from a personalized therapy perspective and the resulting challenges."
Neoadjuvant treatments for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).,"[{'authorId': '5114713', 'name': 'G.

Historically, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has responded well in the neoadjuvant setting, with rates of pathological complete response (pCR) commonly higher than for other breast tumour types. However, more than half of TNBC patients do not achieve a pCR and have a very poor prognosis. The lack of drug-targetable receptors on TNBC tumours has made improving the available interventions in TNBC an area of important medical need. The routine use of neoadjuvant anthracycline/taxane combinations in TNBC is currently being supplemented by ongoing investigations of their use with other types of agent. In particular, the substantial proportion of TNBC tumours associated with BRCA1 mutations is driving clinical research into the use of DNA-damaging agents such as platinums, as well as of potentiators of DNA damage such as the investigational agent iniparib and inhibitors of poly-ADP ribose polymerase such as olaparib. Tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors and microtubule-targeting inhibitors of cell cycling are also under active investigation. The use of neoadjuvant treatment with pCR as a surrogate of overall survival will allow the rapid evaluation and comparison of these and other much-needed new treatments for TNBC."

The aim of this study was to identify a new specific target for specific treatments. Frozen primary tumors were collected from 83 adjuvant therapy-naive TNBC patients. These samples were used for global proteome profiling by iTRAQ-OFFGEL-LC-MS/MS approach in two series: a training cohort (n = 42) and a test set (n = 41). Patients who remains free of local or distant metastasis for a minimum of 5 years after surgery were classified in the no-relapse group; the others were in the relapse group. OPLS and Kaplan–Meier analyses were performed to select candidate markers, which were validated by immunohistochemistry. Three proteins were identified in the training set and validated in the test set by Kaplan–Meier method and immunohistochemistry (IHC): TrpRS as a good prognostic markers and DP and TSP1 as bad prognostic markers. We propose the establishment of an IHC test to calculate the score of TrpRS, DP, and TSP1 in TNBC tumors to evaluate the degree of aggressiveness of the tumors. Finally, we propose that DP and TSP1 could provide therapeutic targets for specific treatments."

Gene expression profiling has identified at least six different triple-negative subtypes with different biology and sensitivity to therapies. The heterogeneous nature of TN tumors may justify the difficulty in treating this BC subtype. Several targeted agents have been investigated in clinical trials without demonstrating a clear survival benefit. Therefore, systemic chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of current clinical practice. Improving the knowledge of tumor biology is mandatory for patient management. In stages II and III, neoadjuvant systemic treatment is an effective option of care. The achievement of a pathological complete response represents an optimal surrogate for survival outcome as well as a test for tumor drug sensitivity. In this review, we provide a brief description of the main predictive biomarkers for tumor response to systemic treatment. Moreover, we review the treatment strategies investigated for TNBCs in neoadjuvant settings focusing on experimental drugs such as immunotherapy and poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase inhibitors that hold promise in the treatment of this aggressive disease. Therefore, the management of TNBC represents an urgent, current, unmet need in daily clinical practice. A key recommendation is to design biology-driven clinical trials wherein TNBC patients may be treated on the basis of tumor molecular profile."

This acronym simply means that the tumour does not express oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) and does not exhibit amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene. Despite this unambiguous definition, TNBCs are an heterogeneous group of tumours with just one common clinical feature: a distinctly aggressive nature with higher rates of relapse and shorter overall survival in the metastatic setting compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. Because of the absence of well-defined molecular targets, cytotoxic chemotherapy is currently the only treatment option for TNBC. In the last decades, the use of more aggressive chemotherapy has produced a clear improvement of the prognosis in women with TNBC, but this approach results in an unacceptable deterioration in the quality of life, also if some support therapies try to relieve patients from distress. In addition, there is the general belief that it is impossible to further improve the prognosis of TNBC patients with chemotherapy alone. In view of that, there is a feverish search for new “clever drugs” able both to rescue chemo-resistant, and to reduce the burden of chemotherapy in chemo-responsive TNBC patients. A major obstacle to identifying actionable targets in TNBC is the vast disease heterogeneity both inter-tumour and intra-tumour and years of study have failed to demonstrate a single unifying alteration that is targetable in TNBC. TNBC is considered the subtype that best benefits from the neoadjuvant model, since the strong correlation between pathological Complete Response and long-term Disease-Free-Survival in these patients. In this review, we discuss the recent discoveries that have furthered our understanding of TNBC, with a focus on the subtyping of TNBC. We also explore the implications of these discoveries for future treatments and highlight the need for a completely different type of clinical trials."

The adaptability of siRNA nanoparticles enables the delivery of virtually any siRNA, which is especially advantageous for therapeutic applications in heterogeneous diseases that lack unifying molecular features, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer that is stratified by the lack of estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor expression and HER2 amplification. There are currently no FDA-approved targeted therapies for the treatment of TNBCs, making cytotoxic chemotherapy the only treatment option available to these patients. In this review, we outline the current status of siRNA nanoparticles in clinical trials for cancer treatment and discuss the promising preclinical approaches that have utilized siRNA nanoparticles for TNBC treatment. Next, we address TNBC subtype-specific therapeutic interventions and highlight where and how siRNA nanoparticles fit into these strategies. Lastly, we point out ongoing challenges in the field of siRNA nanoparticle research that, if addressed, would significantly improve the efficacy of siRNA nanoparticles as a therapeutic option for cancer treatment."

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are extremely intricate in tumorigenesis and cancerous metastasis. Nonetheless, their roles in the initiation and augmentation of TNBC remain elusive. Here, in silico analysis and validation experiments were utilized to analyze the expression pattern of clinically effective lncRNAs in TNBC, among which a protective lncRNA LYPLAL1-DT was essentially curbed in TNBC samples and indicated a favorable prognosis. Gain- and loss-of-function assays elucidated that LYPLAL1-DT considerably attenuated the proliferative and metastatic properties along with epithelial-mesenchymal transition of TNBC cells. Moreover, forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) was validated to modulate the transcription of LYPLAL1-DT. Mechanistically, LYPLAL1-DT impinged on the malignancy of TNBC mainly by restraining the aberrant reactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, explicitly destabilizing and diminishing β-catenin protein by interacting with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK) and constricting the formation of the hnRNPK/β-catenin complex. Conclusively, our present research revealed the anti-oncogenic effects of LYPLAL1-DT in TNBC, unraveling the molecular mechanisms of the FOXO1/LYPLAL1-DT/hnRNPK/β-catenin signaling axis, which shed innovative light on the potential curative medicine of TNBC."

Ferroptosis has been recognized as a natural barrier for cancer progression and represents a significant role of RT-mediated anticancer effects, while the simultaneous activation of ferroptosis defensive system during RT limits the synergistic effect between RT and ferroptosis. Herein, we engineered a tumor microenvironment (TME) degradable nanohybrid with a dual radiosensitization manner to combine ferroptosis induction and high-Z effect based on metal-organic frameworks for ferroptosis-augmented RT of TNBC. The encapsulated l-buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO) could inhibit glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis for glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) inactivation to break down the ferroptosis defensive system, and the delivered ferrous ions could act as a powerful ferroptosis executor via triggering the Fenton reaction; the combination of them induces potent ferroptosis, which could synergize with the surface decorated Gold (Au) NPs-mediated radiosensitization to improve RT efficacy. In vivo antitumor results revealed that the nanohybrid could significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy and antimetastasis efficiency based on the combinational mechanism between ferroptosis and RT. This work thus demonstrated that combining RT with efficient ferroptosis induction through nanotechnology was a feasible and promising strategy for TNBC treatment."

At present, comparisons between adjuvant chemotherapy regimens are retrospective in nature, and so the optimal drugs or drug combinations have not been established for patients with early TNBC.

Classical CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil) has shown efficacy, whereas few data on the role of anthracyclines are available. An unplanned subgroup analysis of one randomised study suggests that capecitabine adds efficacy to a taxane-anthracycline regimen, but this observation requires confirmation. High-dose adjuvant chemotherapy is considered experimental. Ongoing trials are comparing standard adjuvant regimens with regimens that integrate an anti-angiogenic agent, a platin or maintenance capecitabine. Inhibitors of DNA repair or specific tyrosine kinases have not yet been addressed in the adjuvant setting. In the absence of data from prospective trials that focus on adjuvant therapy of early TNBC, several regimens, such as a taxane and an anthracycline-containing regimen or classical CMF may be considered reasonable choices."

Patients with TNBC do not benefit from hormonal or trastuzumab-based targeted therapies because of the loss of target receptors. Although these patients respond to chemotherapeutic agents such as taxanes and anthracyclines better than other subtypes of breast cancer, prognosis remains poor. A group of targeted therapies under investigation showed favorable results in TNBC, especially in cancers with BRCA mutation. The lipid-lowering statins (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors), including lovastatin and simvastatin, have been shown to preferentially target TNBC compared with non-TNBC. These statins hold great promise for the management of TNBC.

Owing to the lack of therapeutic targets, chemotherapy and surgical intervention are the only treatments for TNBC. However, the effectiveness of chemotherapeutics is limited by its shortcomings such as poor targeting, easy removal and high toxicity. Recently, exosomes have attracted more and more attention as a drug delivery system. As endogenous vesicles, exosomes ensure low immunogenicity, nontoxicity, and long blood circulation time. In addition, immune cell-derived exosomes can mimic the immune cell to target tumor cells. Herein, we developed a macrophage-derived exosome-coated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoplatform for targeted chemotherapy of TNBC. To further improve the tumor targetability, the surface of the exosome was modified with a peptide to target the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-Met), which is overexpressed by TNBC cells. The results showed that the engineered exosome-coated nanoparticles significantly improved the cellular uptake efficiency and the antitumor efficacy of doxorubicin. In vivo study demonstrated that the nanocarriers exhibited remarkable tumor-targeting efficacy, led to increased inhibition of tumor growth and induced intense tumor apoptosis. These results indicated that the engineered macrophage exosome-coated nanoparticles were a promising drug delivery strategy for TNBC treatment."

As a result, hormonal or trastuzumab-based treatments are ineffective in TNBC patients. TNBCs are biologically aggressive, and despite some evidence that they respond to treatment better than other forms of breast cancer, the prognosis remains poor. This is attributed to a shorter disease-free interval in adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings, as well as a more aggressive metastatic course. TNBC has a lot of clinical ramifications. In terms of new treatment methods, TNBC has lagged behind other types of breast cancer. There are not many options for treating this form of breast cancer because it is progressive. Many effective treatments for most breast cancers block the growth-stimulating effects of ER, PR, and/or HER2, leaving TNBC with few choices. Finding new and effective treatment options for TNBC remains a critical clinical need. To develop more effective drugs, new experimental approaches must be tested in patients with TNBC."

Thus, better stratification systems that reflect intrinsic and clinically useful differences between TNBC tumors will sharpen the treatment approaches and improve clinical outcomes. The lack of a rational classification system for TNBC also impacts current and emerging therapeutic alternatives. In the past years, several new methodologies to stratify TNBC have arisen thanks to the implementation of microarray technology, high-throughput sequencing, and bioinformatic methods, exponentially increasing the amount of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic information available. Thus, new TNBC subtypes are being characterized with the promise to advance the treatment of this challenging disease. However, the diverse nature of the molecular data, the poor integration between the various methods, and the lack of cost-effective methods for systematic classification have hampered the widespread implementation of these promising developments. However, the advent of artificial intelligence applied to translational oncology promises to bring light into definitive TNBC subtypes. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the available classification strategies. It includes evaluating the overlap between the molecular, immunohistochemical, and clinical characteristics between these approaches and a perspective about the increasing applications of artificial intelligence to identify definitive and clinically relevant TNBC subtypes."

This review article surveys the latest evidence concerning the role of genomic alteration in current TNBC treatment responses, current clinical trials and potential targeting sites, CSC and drug resistance, and potential strategies targeting CSCs in TNBC.

Although patients with TNBC show sensitivity to some chemotherapy regimens, in early-stage disease greater emphasis is placed on locoregional treatments, based on surgery and radiation therapy (RT). Ongoing improvements in both screening and surgical techniques have reduced the need for radical surgical intervention in all breast cancers, and breast-conserving surgery (BCS) followed by RT is now increasingly common for all tumour types. However, while evidence has clearly established the importance of post-surgical RT for favourable long-term outcomes in breast cancer, it is less well-established as to where and under which conditions more radical surgeries than BCS, such as modified radical mastectomy (MRM), may be indicated for TNBC. A high proportion of TNBC tumours are BRCA1-mutated and therefore patients with this type of tumour are at a potentially elevated risk of ipsilateral or contralateral recurrence. In addition, while some studies indicate that post-BCS locoregional TNBC relapse rates generally appear similar to other tumour types, some evidence suggests that distant relapse rates may be higher. There is evidence that some subtypes of TNBC may require MRM rather than BCS for optimal long-term outcomes. More research is needed to establish whether TNBC-specific approaches to locoregional treatment may be required."

Due to absence of targetable hormone receptor expression, chemotherapy is the current standard of care for TNBC. However, recurrence and metastasis following treatment with chemotherapy and radiation remain major contributors to mortality. To develop more effective treatments of TNBC, molecular pathways involved in tumor growth, vascularization, and apoptosis have been investigated as potential targets. In this review, we outline promising biological targets that may be implicated in future TNBC treatments. Abstract Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive form of breast cancer. Due to its heterogeneity and lack of hormone receptor expression, this subtype is more likely to metastasize and resist treatment attempts than are other forms of breast cancer. Due to the absence of targetable receptors, chemotherapy and breast conserving surgery have been the predominant treatment options for patients. However, resistance to chemotherapy and local recurrence of the tumors is frequent. Emerging immunotherapies have begun to change treatment plans for patients diagnosed with TNBC. In this review, we discuss the various immune pathways identified in TNBC and the role they play as targets for new potential treatment choices. Various therapeutic options that inhibit key pathways in cellular growth cycles, DNA repair mechanisms, epithelial mesenchymal transition, and immunosuppression have been shown to improve survival in patients with this disease. With promising results thus far, continued studies of immunotherapy and neoadjuvant therapy options for TNBC are likely to alter the treatment course for these diagnoses in the future."

It is generally considered to be the most difficult breast cancer subtype to deal with, due to the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which usually direct targeted therapies. In this scenario, the current treatments of TNBC-affected patients rely on tumor excision and conventional chemotherapy. As a result, the prognosis is overall poor. Thus, the identification and characterization of targets for novel therapies are urgently required. The Notch signaling pathway has emerged to act in the pathogenesis and tumor progression of TNBCs. Firstly, Notch receptors are associated with the regulation of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) behavior, as well as with the aetiology of TNBCs. Secondly, there is a strong evidence that Notch pathway is a relevant player in mammary cancer stem cells maintenance and expansion. Finally, Notch receptors expression and activation strongly correlate with the aggressive clinicopathological and biological phenotypes of breast cancer (e.g., invasiveness and chemoresistance), which are relevant characteristics of TNBC subtype. The purpose of this up-to-date review is to provide a detailed overview of the specific role of all four Notch receptors (Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, and Notch4) in TNBCs, thus identifying the Notch signaling pathway deregulation/activation as a pathognomonic feature of this breast cancer subtype. Furthermore, this review will also discuss recent information associated with different therapeutic options related to the four Notch receptors, which may be useful to evaluate prognostic or predictive indicators as well as to develop new therapies aimed at improving the clinical outcome of TNBC patients."

We explored the clinicopathological characteristics of Lehmann subtypes and their association with the pathologic complete response (pCR) to different treatments. The global pCR rate was 37%, and it was unevenly distributed within Lehmann’s subtypes. Basal-like 1 (BL1) tumors exhibited the highest pCR to carboplatin containing regimens (80% vs 23%, p=0.027) and were the most proliferative (Ki-67>50% of 88.2% vs. 63.7%, p=0.02). Luminal-androgen receptor (LAR) patients achieved the lowest pCR to all treatments (14.3% vs 42.7%, p=0.045 when excluding mesenchymal stem-like (MSL) samples) and were the group with the lowest proliferation (Ki-67≤50% of 71% vs 27%, p=0.002). In our cohort, only tumors with LAR phenotype presented non-basal-like intrinsic subtypes (HER2-enriched and luminal A). TNBC patients present tumors with a high genetic diversity ranging from highly proliferative tumors, likely responsive to platinum-based therapies, to a subset of chemoresistant tumors with low proliferation and luminal characteristics."

As available targeted treatments are not effective, aggressive chemotherapy is frequently advocated for patients with TNBC. It is now becoming apparent that TNBC is not one entity but constitutes a range of malignancies with different clinical behaviour. This paper reviews 7 distinct histological subtypes of TNBC where the overall prognosis is favourable, and aggressive systemic treatment is generally not indicated. Their recognition and separation from the larger group of no special type TNBC are important. The members of the European Working Group for Breast Screening Pathology review the morphology, known molecular features and reported outcomes, and formulate a consensus statement regarding the approach to the subtypes that are associated with a favourable prognosis. Abstract Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), as a group of tumours, have a worse prognosis than stage-matched non-TNBC and lack the benefits of routinely available targeted therapy. However, TNBC is a heterogeneous group of neoplasms, which includes some special type carcinomas with a relatively indolent course. This review on behalf of the European Working Group for Breast Screening Pathology reviews the literature on the special histological types of BC that are reported to have a triple negative phenotype and indolent behaviour. These include adenoid cystic carcinoma of classical type, low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma, fibromatosis-like metaplastic carcinoma, low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma, secretory carcinoma, acinic cell carcinoma, and tall cell carcinoma with reversed polarity. The pathological and known molecular features as well as clinical data including treatment and prognosis of these special TNBC subtypes are summarised and it is concluded that many patients with these rare TNBC pure subtypes are unlikely to benefit from systemic chemotherapy. A consensus statement of the working group relating to the multidisciplinary approach and treatment of these rare tumour types concludes the review."

There is increasing evidence of the role of tumor lymphocytic immune infiltrates in this subtype of breast cancer. Robust levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been associated with improved disease-free and overall survival rates in TNBC patients with and without any treatment. Recent efforts have been made to develop a standardized methodology for evaluating TILs. The presence of TILs in the breast tumor microenvironment can also predict responses not only to neoadjuvant but also to adjuvant chemotherapy treatments. High numbers of TILs correlate with increased pathological complete responses (pCR) in TNBC. TILs are prognostic and predictive of response to standard therapies; thus, the immune system appears to play an active role in a subgroup of breast cancer. There is an increasing interest in directly targeting the immune system as part of breast cancer therapy, mainly in patients with TNBC. New immune modulatory agents, including immune checkpoints inhibitors, have shown promising activity in a subgroup of metastatic TNBC. Increased programmed cell death protein 1 ligand (PD-L1) expression on the surface of TNBC provides the rationale for implementing therapeutic strategies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in TNBC. The programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor pembrolizumab, and the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab have shown promising results in clinical trials."

We reviewed this concept considering recent results in the field. Areas covered Herein, the authors cover neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without biologics in triple-negative and HER2-positive operable breast cancer with a focus on rates of complete pathological remission (pCR) in the breast and axilla. The impact of the CREATE X and KATERINE randomized clinical trials of post-surgical treatments in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is also discussed. Expert opinion The CREATE X and KATERINE clinical trials show for the first time and with methodological strengths that, in TNBC and HER2-positive breast cancer patients, post-surgical capecitabine and T-DM1, respectively, can improve prognosis when the disease persists after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, the role of pCR as a treatment endpoint and a guide for further treatment decisions is now demonstrated. On account of these results, neoadjuvant chemotherapy becomes not an option, but rather the preferred treatment strategy for more and more TNBC and HER2-positive breast cancer patients in clinical practice."

PIK3CA is an oncogene that encodes the p110α subunit of class IA PI3K to regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis. Some reports have observed neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) to have poor pathological complete response (pCR) rates in TNBC with PIK3CA mutation. This study aimed to explore the mechanism of how mutant PIK3CA alters chemotherapeutic susceptibility in TNBC. Methods TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) with PIK3CA gene mutations (E545K and H1047R regions) and overexpression were established by transfection. NOD/SCID mice were used for in vivo experiments. Epirubicin was used as the chemotherapeutic agent. Cell viability, cell cycle, apoptosis, and Transwell assays were conducted for phenotype analysis. Western blot, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect gene and protein expression levels. A clinical analysis of 50 patients with TNBC was also performed. Results Cell viability and Transwell assays showed that PIK3CA mutation promoted TNBC cell growth and conferred an enhanced migratory phenotype. Cell cycle and apoptosis assays showed that PIK3CA mutation moderately improved the proliferation ability of TNBC cells and remarkably inhibited their apoptosis. After epirubicin therapy, the proportion of early apoptotic cells decreased among cells with PIK3CA mutation. Further, xenograft tumors grew faster in NOD/SCID mice injected with mutated cell lines than in control group, suggesting that PIK3CA mutation caused chemotherapy resistance. Importantly, western blot and immunohistochemical analysis showed that cells and mouse tumors in the PIK3CA mutation groups exhibited different expression levels of apoptosis-related markers (Xiap, Bcl-2, and Caspase 3) and proteins associated with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (p110α, AKT, p-AKT, mTOR, p-mTOR, p-4E-BP1, p-p70S6K, and Pten). Moreover, prognostic analysis of 50 patients with TNBC indicated that PIK3CA mutation might be linked with relapse and death. Conclusions PIK3CA mutation confers resistance to chemotherapy in TNBC by inhibiting apoptosis and activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway."

This review summarizes the recent advances, challenges and potential new approaches of immunotherapy in TNBC. Abstract With improved understanding of the immunogenicity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), immunotherapy has emerged as a promising candidate to treat this lethal disease owing to the lack of specific targets and effective treatments. While immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) has been effectively used in immunotherapy for several types of solid tumor, monotherapies targeting programmed death 1 (PD-1), its ligand PD-L1, or cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) have shown little efficacy for TNBC patients. Over the past few years, various therapeutic candidates have been reviewed, attempting to improve ICI efficacy on TNBC through combinatorial treatment. In this review, we describe the clinical limitations of ICI and illustrate candidates from an immunological, pharmacological, and metabolic perspective that may potentiate therapy to improve the outcomes of TNBC patients."

The propensity to develop breast cancer brain metastases (BCBMs) varies by subtype, occurring in up to one half of those with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), approximately a third of HER+ breast cancers and 14% in hormone positive disease. Median survival after BCBM diagnosis can be as short as 5 months in TNBC and 10-18 months in the other subtypes. Here, we review the biology of BCBMs and how it informs the rational design of new therapeutic approaches and agents. We discuss application of novel targeted and immunotherapies by breast cancer subtype. It is noteworthy that there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments specifically for BCBMs currently. Nevertheless, there are legitimate grounds for hope as patients with BCBMs are now being included in clinical trials of systemic therapies and a better understanding of the biology and genetic underpinning of BCBMs is driving an increased range of options for patients."

Chemoresistance and lack of targeted therapeutics are major hindrances to effective treatments in the clinic and are crucial causes of a worse prognosis and high rate of relapse/recurrence in patients diagnosed with TNBC. In the last decade, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to perform a pivotal role in most cellular functions. The aberrant functional expression of lncRNAs plays an ever-increasing role in the progression of diverse malignancies, including TNBC. Therefore, lncRNAs have been recently studied as predictors and modifiers of chemoresistance. Our review discusses the potential involvement of lncRNAs in drug-resistant mechanisms commonly found in TNBC and highlights various therapeutic strategies to target lncRNAs in this malignancy."

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype with low survival rate and a lack of biomarkers and targeted treatments. Here, we target pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a key metabolic component of oncogenesis. In patients with TNBC, PKM2pS37 was identified as a prominent phosphoprotein corresponding to the aggressive breast cancer phenotype that showed a characteristic nuclear staining pattern and prognostic value. Phosphorylation of PKM2 at S37 was connected with a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) pathway in TNBC cells. In parallel, pyruvate kinase activator TEPP-46 bound PKM2pS37 and reduced its nuclear localization. In a TNBC mouse xenograft model, treatment with either TEPP-46 or the potent CDK inhibitor dinaciclib reduced tumor growth and diminished PKM2pS37. Combinations of dinaciclib with TEPP-46 reduced cell invasion, impaired redox balance, and triggered cancer cell death. Collectively, these data support an approach to identify PKM2pS37-positive TNBC and target the PKM2 regulatory axis as a potential treatment. Significance: PKM2 phosphorylation marks aggressive breast cancer cell phenotypes and targeting PKM2pS37 could be an effective therapeutic approach for treating triple-negative breast cancer."
Flubendazole elicits anti-cancer effects via targeting EVA1A-modulated autophagy and apoptosis in Triple-negative Breast Cancer,"[{'authorId': '49370329', 'name': 'Yongqi Zhen'}, {'authorId': '114895739', 'name': 'Rongyan Zhao'}, {'authorId': '2144295774', 'name': 'Minjuan Wang'}, {'authorId': '2157945940', 'name': 'Xing Jiang'}, {'authorId': '1424337089', 'name': 'Feng Gao'}, {'authorId': '8401321', 'name': 'L.

The lack of an effective targeted therapy also leads to a poor prognosis for patients affected by TNBC. In the present study, we repurposed the distinctive inhibitory effects of flubendazole, a traditional anthelmintic drug, towards the putative modulation of proliferation and migration of TNBC in vitro and in vivo. Methods: According to a series of experimental approaches, including immunofluorescence (IF), immunoblotting (IB), siRNA and GFP-mRFP-LC3 plasmid transfection, respectively, we have found that flubendazole is capable of inducing autophagic cell death and apoptosis, thus exerting some anti-proliferative and anti-migration activity in TNBC cells. The therapeutic effects of flubendazole were evaluated by xenograft mouse models, followed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), IF and IB. Changes in the gene expression profiles of flubendazole-treated TNBC cells were analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and validated by IB. The potential binding mode of flubendazole and EVA1A was predicted by molecular docking and demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis. Results: We have presently found that flubendazole exhibits a considerable anti-proliferative activity in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the induction of autophagic cell death appears to be pivotal for flubendazole-mediated growth inhibition of TNBC cells, whereas blocking autophagy was able to improve the survival rate and migration ability of flubendazole-treated TNBC cells. Specifically, RNA-seq analysis showed that flubendazole treatment could promote the up-regulation of EVA1A. Flubendazole may regulate autophagy and apoptosis by targeting EVA1A, thus affecting the mechanisms of TNBC proliferation and migration. Furthermore, Thr113 may be the key amino acid residues for the binding of flubendazole to EVA1A. Conclusion: Our results provide novel insights towards the putative anti-cancer efficacy of flubendazole. Furthermore, here we show that flubendazole could serve as a potential therapeutic drug in TNBC. Altogether, this study highlights the possibility of this repurposed autophagic inducer for future cancer treatments."

During the last two decades, the use of targeted therapies has emerged in clinical research in order to increase treatment efficiency, improve prognosis and reduce recurrence. However, the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype remains a clinical challenge, with poor prognosis since no therapeutic targets have been identified. This aggressive breast cancer entity lacks expression of oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), and it does not overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The major reason for TNBC poor prognosis is early therapeutic escape from conventional treatments, leading to aggressive metastatic relapse. Metastases occur after an epithelial-mesenchymal transition EMT of epithelial cells, allowing them to break free from the primary tumour site and to colonize distant organs. Cancer-associated EMT consists not only of acquired migration and invasion ability, but involves complex and comprehensive reprogramming, including changes in metabolism, expression levels and epigenetic. Recently, many studies have considered epigenetic alterations as the primary initiator of cancer development and metastasis. This review builds a picture of the epigenetic modifications implicated in the EMT of breast cancer. It focuses on TNBC and allows comparisons with other subtypes. It emphasizes the role of the main epigenetic modifications lncRNAs, miRNAs, histone and DNA- modifications in tumour invasion and appearance of metastases. These epigenetic alterations can be considered biomarkers representing potential diagnostic and prognostic factors in order to define a global metastatic signature for TNBC."

Furthermore, the benefit of PARP inhibitors (PARPi) in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) remains unknown. Recent evidence indicates that in TNBCs, cells that display “cancer stem cell” properties are resistant to conventional treatments, mediate tumor metastasis, and contribute to recurrence. The sensitivity of breast cancer stem cells (CSC) to PARPi is unknown. Experimental Design: We determined the sensitivity of breast CSCs to PARP inhibition in BRCA1-mutant and -wild-type TNBC cell lines and tumor xenografts. We also investigated the role of RAD51 in mediating CSC resistance to PARPi in these in vitro and in vivo models. Results: We demonstrated that the CSCs in BRCA1-mutant TNBCs were resistant to PARP inhibition, and that these cells had both elevated RAD51 protein levels and activity. Downregulation of RAD51 by shRNA sensitized CSCs to PARP inhibition and reduced tumor growth. BRCA1–wild-type cells were relatively resistant to PARP inhibition alone, but reduction of RAD51 sensitized both CSC and bulk cells in these tumors to PARPi treatment. Conclusions: Our data suggest that in both BRCA1-mutant and BRCA1–wild-type TNBCs, CSCs are relatively resistant to PARP inhibition. This resistance is mediated by RAD51, suggesting that strategies aimed at targeting RAD51 may increase the therapeutic efficacy of PARPi. Clin Cancer Res; 23(2); 514–22. ©2016 AACR."

In this modern era of precision medicine, several new therapeutic strategies and novel agents have been investigated in the neoadjuvant setting of TNBC, in order to individualize treatment. Areas covered This review provides a comprehensive overview of the currently available evidence regarding the activity and efficacy of platinum agents, PARP- and immune-checkpoint-inhibitors for the neoadjuvant treatment of TNBC, highlighting the available data on potential predictive biomarkers of response or resistance to such treatments. Expert opinion The genomic and immune landscape of TNBC has encouraged the exploration of drugs that interfere with the DNA repair mechanism and that modulate immune response. Overall, these drugs seem to improve the pCR rate in TNBC, despite preliminary and heterogeneous results. Taking into account the economic issues and the side effects of these drugs, it is crucial to further explore the potential predictive role of BRCA mutational status and homologous recombination deficiency score, for platinum agents and PARP-inhibitors, and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and other immune biomarkers for checkpoint inhibitors, respectively."

Among the different subtypes, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by the total absence of the estrogen-receptor (ER) and progesteron-receptor (PR) expression as well as the lack of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression or gene amplification. These biological characteristics confer to TNBC a higher aggressiveness and relapse risk along with poorer prognosis compared to other subtypes. Indeed, 5-years survival rate is still low and almost all patients die, despite any adjuvant treatment which at moment represents the heading pharmacological approach. To date, several clinical trials have been designed to investigate the potential role of some molecular markers, such as VEGF, EGFR, Src and mTOR, for targeted treatments in TNBC. In fact, many inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, frequently de-regulated in TNBC, are acquiring a growing interest and several inhibitors are in preclinical development or already in early phase clinical trials. In this Review, we investigated the role of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in TNBC patients, by summarizing the molecular features that led to the distinction of different histotypes of TNBC. Furthermore, we provided an overview of the inhibition mechanisms of the mTOR and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, highlighting the importance of integrating biological and clinical data for the development of mTOR inhibitors in order to implement targeted therapies for TNBC patients."

As compared to traditional breast cancer treatments such as surgery and chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a promising approach for treating TNBC due to its precise controllability, high spatiotemporal accuracy, and minimal invasive nature. However, traditional photosensitizers used in PDT are associated with limitations of aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ), and the ACQ induced a significant decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. To address these, we synthesized a cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (cRGD) peptide-decorated conjugated polymer (CP) nanoparticles with poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV) as the photosensitizer for the theranostics of TNBC. The synthesized CP nanoparticles show bright fluorescence with high stability and could effectively produce ROS under light irradiation. Cell viability studies showed that the CP nanoparticles have negligible dark cytotoxicity and could efficiently kill the αvβ3 integrin-overexpressed MDA-MB-231 cells (one subtype of TNBC cells) in a selective way. With the use of cRGD-modified MEH-PPV nanoparticles as the theranostic agent, it permits targeted imaging and PDT of TNBC both in the in vitro 3D tumor model and in living mice. The application of CP nanoparticles in the successful theranostics of TNBC could pave the way for future development of CP-based photosensitizers for clinical applications."

We investigated whether higher peripheral lymphocyte counts are associated with lower breast cancer–specific mortality (BCM) and overall mortality (OM) in TNBC. Experimental Design: Data on treatments and diagnostic tests from electronic medical records of two health care systems were linked with demographic, clinical, pathologic, and mortality data from the California Cancer Registry. Multivariable regression models adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, cancer stage, grade, neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy use, radiotherapy use, and germline BRCA1/2 mutations were used to evaluate associations between absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), BCM, and OM. For a subgroup with TIL data available, we explored the relationship between TILs and peripheral lymphocyte counts. Results: A total of 1,463 stage I–III TNBC patients were diagnosed from 2000 to 2014; 1,113 (76%) received neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy within 1 year of diagnosis. Of 759 patients with available ALC data, 481 (63.4%) were ever lymphopenic (minimum ALC <1.0 K/μL). On multivariable analysis, higher minimum ALC, but not absolute neutrophil count, predicted lower OM [HR = 0.23; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.16–0.35] and BCM (HR = 0.19; CI, 0.11–0.34). Five-year probability of BCM was 15% for patients who were ever lymphopenic versus 4% for those who were not. An exploratory analysis (n = 70) showed a significant association between TILs and higher peripheral lymphocyte counts during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Conclusions: Higher peripheral lymphocyte counts predicted lower mortality from early-stage, potentially curable TNBC, suggesting that immune function may enhance the effectiveness of early TNBC treatment.

New targeted therapies are therefore an urgent unmet medical need for this patient population. Translational and clinical studies into new TNBC treatments have been facilitated by the increased understanding of the aberrant signal transduction pathways regulating growth and survival and the development of chemoresistance in TNBC. Some of the established targeted agents that have been approved in other indications may prove beneficial to patients with TNBC; however, in the absence of approved targeted agents for the treatment of TNBC, most new agents remain experimental. Increased understanding of molecular profiles of TNBC subtypes is likely to improve therapeutic strategies with targeted agents. Novel strategies have reached clinical evaluation in patients with TNBC, including targeting angiogenesis vascular endothelial growth factor and proliferation signalling (receptor tyrosine kinases and mammalian target of rapamycin). Aggressive TNBCs have been found to associate closely with BRCA1 mutation or dysregulation. The recent development of new investigational agents targeting DNA repair, either directly with poly(adenosine disphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitors or indirectly through DNA-binding or DNA-damage potentiation, is a major focus of current clinical studies. These and other targeted therapies represent a new approach to TNBC therapy."

Based on 3,247 gene expression profiles from 21 breast cancer data sets, we discovered six TNBC subtypes from 587 TNBC samples with unique gene expression patterns and ontologies. Cell line models representing each of the TNBC subtypes also displayed different sensitivities to targeted therapeutic agents. Classification of TNBC into subtypes will advance further genomic research and clinical applications. Result We developed a web-based subtyping tool TNBCtype for candidate TNBC samples using our gene expression meta data and classification methods. Given a gene expression data matrix, this tool will display for each candidate sample the predicted subtype, the corresponding correlation coefficient, and the permutation P-value. We offer a user-friendly web interface to predict the subtypes for new TNBC samples that may facilitate diagnostics, biomarker selection, drug discovery, and the more tailored treatment of breast cancer."

From Models to Breast Cancer Treatments Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a particularly aggressive form, have few treatment options. Targeting either the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to Akt (PI3K-Akt) pathway or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibits tumor growth in some patients, but durable responses are rare. Modeling studies using cell lines predict that the EGFR family member HER3 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 3) may confer drug resistance. Now, Tao et al. provide evidence from patient tumors to support those predictions. Treatment with PI3K-Akt pathway inhibitors increased the abundance of both total and activated HER3 in TNBC cells in culture and TNBC xenografts in mice. Residual tumors from patients treated with EGFR inhibitors had increased abundance and activation of HER3. Combining inhibitors of the PI3K-Akt pathway with a dual inhibitor of EGFR and HER3 substantially suppressed tumor growth in mice with TNBC xenografts derived from either cell lines or patients, suggesting that this combined strategy may improve therapeutic outcome in TNBC patients. Both abundant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or ErbB1) and high activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt pathway are common and therapeutically targeted in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, activation of another EGFR family member [human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) (or ErbB3)] may limit the antitumor effects of these drugs. We found that TNBC cell lines cultured with the EGFR or HER3 ligand EGF or heregulin, respectively, and treated with either an Akt inhibitor (GDC-0068) or a PI3K inhibitor (GDC-0941) had increased abundance and phosphorylation of HER3. The phosphorylation of HER3 and EGFR in response to these treatments was reduced by the addition of a dual EGFR and HER3 inhibitor (MEHD7945A). MEHD7945A also decreased the phosphorylation (and activation) of EGFR and HER3 and the phosphorylation of downstream targets that occurred in response to the combination of EGFR ligands and PI3K-Akt pathway inhibitors. In culture, inhibition of the PI3K-Akt pathway combined with either MEHD7945A or knockdown of HER3 decreased cell proliferation compared with inhibition of the PI3K-Akt pathway alone. Combining either GDC-0068 or GDC-0941 with MEHD7945A inhibited the growth of xenografts derived from TNBC cell lines or from TNBC patient tumors, and this combination treatment was also more effective than combining either GDC-0068 or GDC-0941 with cetuximab, an EGFR-targeted antibody. After therapy with EGFR-targeted antibodies, some patients had residual tumors with increased HER3 abundance and EGFR/HER3 dimerization (an activating interaction). Thus, we propose that concomitant blockade of EGFR, HER3, and the PI3K-Akt pathway in TNBC should be investigated in the clinical setting."

The recent FDA approval for immune checkpoint inhibition in combination with nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of metastatic TNBC created opportunity to advocate for immunotherapy in TNBC patients. However, improving the current low response rates is vital. Most cancers, including TNBC tumors, display metabolic plasticity and undergo reprogramming into highly glycolytic tumors through the Warburg effect. Consequently, accumulation of the metabolic byproduct lactate and extracellular acidification is often observed in several solid tumors, thereby exacerbating tumor cell proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis. In this review, we focus on the role of lactate acidosis in the microenvironment of glycolytic breast tumors as a major driver for immune evasion with a special emphasis on TNBCs. In particular, we will discuss the role of lactate regulators such as glucose transporters, lactate dehydrogenases, and lactate transporters in modulating immune functionality and checkpoint expression in numerous immune cell types. This review aims to spark discussion on interventions targeting lactate acidosis in combination with immunotherapy to provide an effective means of improving response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in TNBC, in addition to highlighting challenges that may arise from TNBC tumor heterogeneity."

Recent studies have identified metabolic alterations in cancer cells that can be targeted to improve responses to standard-of-care chemotherapy regimens. Using MDA-MB-468 and SUM-159PT TNBC cells, along with LC-MS/MS and HPLC metabolomics profiling, we found here that exposure of TNBC cells to the cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs cisplatin and doxorubicin alter arginine and polyamine metabolites. This alteration was because of a reduction in the levels and activity of a rate-limiting polyamine biosynthetic enzyme, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). Using gene silencing and inhibitor treatments, we determined that the reduction in ODC was mediated by its negative regulator antizyme, targeting ODC to the proteasome for degradation. Treatment with the ODC inhibitor difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) sensitized TNBC cells to chemotherapy, but this was not observed in receptor-positive breast cancer cells. Moreover, TNBC cell lines had greater sensitivity to single-agent DFMO, and ODC levels were elevated in TNBC patient samples. The alterations in polyamine metabolism in response to chemotherapy, as well as DFMO-induced preferential sensitization of TNBC cells to chemotherapy, reported here suggest that ODC may be a targetable metabolic vulnerability in TNBC."

Since TNBC lacks expression of ERα, PR and HER2, existing targeted treatments are not effective and the survival is poor. In this study, we demonstrate that the tumor suppressor microRNA miR-200a directly regulates the oncogene EPH receptor A2 (EPHA2) and modulates TNBC migration. We show that EPHA2 expression is correlated with poor survival specifically in basal-like breast cancer and that its expression is repressed by miR-200a through direct interaction with the 3'UTR of EPHA2. This regulation subsequently affects the downstream activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and results in decreased cell migration of TNBC. We establish that miR-200a directs cell migration in a dual manner; in addition to regulating the well-characterized E-cadherin pathway it also regulates a EPHA2 pathway. The miR-200a-EPHA2 axis is a novel mechanism highlighting the possibility of utilizing miR-200a delivery to target TNBC metastases."

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) perform multiple cytotoxic actions and are emerging as promising multifunctional agents in TNBC. Areas covered: This review focuses on the challenges so far addressed in the targeted treatment of TNBC and explores the various mechanisms by which HDACis control cancer cell growth, tumor progression and metastases. Pivotal preclinical trials on HDACis like panobinostat, vorinostat, and entinostat show that these epigenetic agents exert an anti-proliferative effect on TNBC cells and control tumor growth by multiple mechanisms of action, including apoptosis and regulation of the epithelial to mesenchimal transition (EMT). Combination studies have reported the synergism of HDACis with other anticancer agents. Expert opinion: In recent years, treatment of TNBC has recorded a high number of failures in the development of targeted agents. HDACis alone or in combination strategies show promising activity in TNBC and could have implications for the future targeted treatment of TNBC patients. Future research should identify which agent synergizes better with HDACis and which patient will benefit more from these epigenetic agents."

This is largely due to cancer plasticity and the development of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Recently, distinct yet interconvertible mesenchymal‐like and epithelial‐like states have been revealed in breast CSCs. Thus, strategies capable of simultaneously inhibiting bulk and CSC populations in both mesenchymal and epithelial states have yet to be developed. Wnt/β‐catenin and Hippo/YAP pathways are crucial in tumorigenesis, but importantly also possess tumor suppressor functions in certain contexts. One possibility is that TNBC cells in epithelial or mesenchymal state may differently affect Wnt/β‐catenin and Hippo/YAP signaling and CSC phenotypes. In this report, we found that YAP signaling and CD44high/CD24−/low CSCs were upregulated while Wnt/β‐catenin signaling and ALDH+ CSCs were downregulated in mesenchymal‐like TNBC cells, and vice versa in their epithelial‐like counterparts. Dual knockdown of YAP and Wnt/β‐catenin, but neither alone, was required for effective suppression of both CD44high/CD24−/low and ALDH+ CSC populations in mesenchymal and epithelial TNBC cells. These observations were confirmed with cultured tumor fragments prepared from patients with TNBC after treatment with Wnt inhibitor ICG‐001 and YAP inhibitor simvastatin. In addition, a clinical database showed that decreased gene expression of Wnt and YAP was positively correlated with decreased ALDH and CD44 expression in patients’ samples while increased patient survival. Furthermore, tumor growth of TNBC cells in either epithelial or mesenchymal state was retarded, and both CD44high/CD24−/low and ALDH+ CSC subpopulations were diminished in a human xenograft model after dual administration of ICG‐001 and simvastatin. Tumorigenicity was also hampered after secondary transplantation. These data suggest a new therapeutic strategy for TNBC via dual Wnt and YAP inhibition."

MicroRNAs represent an attractive candidate for targeted therapies against TNBC, due to their natural ability to act as antisense interactors and regulators of entire gene sets involved in malignancy and their superiority over mRNA profiling to accurately classify disease. Here we review the current knowledge regarding miRNAs as biomarkers in TNBC and their potential use as therapeutic targets in this disease. Further, we review other epigenetic changes and interactions of these changes with microRNAs in this breast cancer subtype, which may lead to the discovery of new treatment targets for TNBC."
A review of triple-negative breast cancer.,"[{'authorId': '1422106664', 'name': 'R. Ismail-Khan'}, {'authorId': '145882824', 'name': 'M. Bui'}]",240,2010,5a61aaf8c215e9ad921285f4c1ae37db3084ca86,"BACKGROUND
An estimated 1 million cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually worldwide. Of these, more than 170,000 are described as triple-negative. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by the lack of protein expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) and the absence of HER2 protein overexpression. TNBC is a subtype of breast cancer that overlaps with the ""basal-like"" breast cancer. TNBC has significant clinical implications.


METHODS
The epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical course, prognosis, and pathology of this subtype of breast cancer are reviewed. The authors compare the ""triple-negative"" and ""basal-like"" definitions of breast cancer. A discussion of both standard and experimental treatments for TNBC is included.


RESULTS
The poor prognosis of high-grade TNBC relates to poor disease-free interval in the adjuvant setting, shortened progression-free survival in the metastatic setting, and the lack of targeted therapy. However, not all TNBCs are associated with a poor prognosis.


CONCLUSIONS
Although chemotherapy is the main current treatment of this subtype of breast cancer, new agents such as PARP inhibitors, which show promise in the treatment of TNBC, are currently in clinical trials."

Near infrared photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT) is a cancer treatment that employs an antibody-photosensitizer conjugate (APC) followed by exposure of NIR light for activating selective cytotoxicity on targeted cancer cells and may have application to TNBC. In order to minimize the dose of APC while maximizing the therapeutic effects, dosing of the APC and NIR light need to be optimized. In this study, we investigate in vitro and in vivo efficacy of cetuximab (cet)-IR700 NIR-PIT on two breast cancer models MDAMB231 (TNBC, EGFR moderate) and MDAMB468 (TNBC, EGFR high) cell lines, and demonstrate a method to optimize the dosing APC and NIR light. Method After validating in vitro cell-specific cytotoxicity, NIR-PIT therapeutic effects were investigated in mouse models using cell lines derived from TNBC tumors. Tumor-bearing mice were separated into 4 groups for the following treatments: (1) no treatment (control); (2) 300 μg of cet-IR700 i.v., (APC i.v. only); (3) NIR light exposure only, NIR light was administered at 50 J/cm2 on day 1 and 100 J/cm2 on day 2 (NIR light only); (4) 300 μg of cet-IR700 i.v., NIR light was administered at 50 J/cm2 on day 1 after injection and 100 J/cm2 of light on day 2 after injection (one shot NIR-PIT). To compare different treatment regimens with a fixed dose of APC, we added the following treatments (5) 100 μg of cet-IR700 i.v., NIR light administered at 50 J/cm2 on day 1 and 50 μg of cet-IR700 i.v. immediately after NIR-PIT, then NIR light was administered at 100 J/cm2 on day 2, which were performed two times every week (“two split” NIR-PIT) and (6) 100 μg of cet-IR700 i.v., NIR light was administered at 50 J/cm2 on day 1 and 100 J/cm2 on day 2, which were performed three times per week (“three split” NIR-PIT). Result Both specific binding and NIR-PIT effects were greater with MDAMB468 than MDAMB231 cells in vitro. Tumor accumulation of cet-IR700 in MDAMB468 tumors was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in MDAMB231 tumors in vivo. Tumor growth and survival of MDAMB231 tumor bearing mice was significantly lower in the NIR-PIT treatment group (p < 0.05). In MDAMB468 bearing mice, tumor growth and survival was significantly improved in the NIR-PIT treatment groups in all treatment regimens (one shot NIR-PIT; p < 0.05, “two split” NIR-PIT; p < 0.01, “three split” NIR-PIT; p < 0.001) compared with control groups. Conclusion NIR-PIT for TNBC was effective regardless of expression of EGFR, however, greater cell killing was shown with higher EGFR expression tumor in vitro. In all treatment regimens, NIR-PIT suppressed tumor growth, resulting in significantly prolonged survival that further improved by splitting the APC dose and using repeated light exposures."

MATERIALS & METHODS
PLGA-PEG-NPs were synthesized by emulsion-diffusion-evaporation method, and the experiments were conducted in vitro in MDA-MB-231 and SKBr3 TNBC and normal breast fibroblast cells.


RESULTS
Delivery of orlistat via PLGA-PEG-NPs reduced its IC50 compared with free orlistat. Combined treatment of orlistat-loaded NPs and doxorubicin or antisense-miR-21-loaded NPs significantly enhanced apoptotic effect compared with independent doxorubicin, anti-miR-21-loaded NPs, orlistat-loaded NPs or free orlistat treatments.


CONCLUSION
We demonstrate that orlistat in combination with antisense-miR-21 or current chemotherapy holds great promise as a novel and versatile treatment agent for TNBC."

Huaier polysaccharide (HP), an active ingredient extracted from the mushroom Trametes robiniophila Murr, has been widely used in clinical anti-cancer treatments in China. Here we demonstrated that HP could target BCSCs in TNBC cells, resulting in decreased mammosphere formation, downregulated expression of stem-related genes and reduced proportion of aldehyde dehydrogenase positive cells in vitro, and inhibited xenograft tumor formation in vivo. Mechanically, HP markedly reduced the expression of estrogen receptor α-36 (ERα-36), a recently identified subtype of estrogen receptor α, and attenuated ERα-36-mediated activation of AKT/β-catenin signaling in ERα-36high TNBC cells.

MYC is one of the most powerful oncogenes and is known to be associated with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Its DNA amplification is often part of the targeted DNA-sequencing panels under the assumption of reflecting upregulated signaling. However, it remains unclear if MYC DNA amplification is a surrogate of its upregulated signaling. Thus, we investigated the difference between MYC DNA amplification and mRNA high expression in TNBCs utilizing publicly available cohorts. MYC DNA amplified tumors were found to have various mRNA expression levels, suggesting that MYC DNA amplification does not always result in elevated MYC mRNA expression. Compared to other subtypes, both MYC DNA amplification and mRNA high expression were more frequent in the TNBCs. MYC mRNA high expression, but not DNA amplification, was significantly associated with worse overall survival in the TNBCs. The TNBCs with MYC mRNA high expression enriched MYC target genes, cell cycle related genes, and WNT/β-catenin gene sets, whereas none of them were enriched in MYC DNA amplified TNBCs. In conclusion, MYC mRNA high expression, but not DNA amplification, reflects not only its upregulated signaling pathway, but also clinical significance in TNBCs."

Our results demonstrate that SUM1315 TNBC cells efficiently take up PAMAM-siRNA complexes, leading to significant knockdown of TWIST1 and EMT-related target genes. Knockdown lasts up to one week after transfection and leads to a reduction in migration and invasion, as determined by wound healing and transwell assays. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PAMAM dendrimers can deliver siRNA to xenograft orthotopic tumors and siRNA remains in the tumor for at least four hours after treatment. These results suggest that further development of dendrimer-based delivery of siRNA for TWIST1 silencing may lead to a valuable adjunctive therapy for patients with TNBC."

Experimental Design: IHC analyses were conducted on human and PDX-TNBC samples to evaluate the production of the three biomarkers. The sensitivity of cancer cells expressing or not MT4-MMP to anti-EGFR (erlotinib) or anti-CDK4/6 inhibitor (palbociclib) was evaluated in vitro in 2D and 3D proliferation assays and in vivo using xenografts and PDX-TNBC displaying different RB, MT4-MMP, and EGFR status after single (erlotinib or palbociclib) or combined (erlotinib + palbociclib) treatments. Results: EGFR and MT4-MMP were coexpressed in >70% of TNBC samples and PDX-TNBC, among which approximately 60% maintained RB expression. Notably, approximately 50% of all TNBC and PDX-TNBC expressed the three biomarkers. Single erlotinib and palbociclib treatments drastically reduced the in vitro proliferation of cells expressing EGFR and MT4-MMP when compared with control cells. Both TNBC xenografts and PDX expressing MT4-MMP, EGFR, and RB, but not PDX-TNBC with RB loss, were sensitive to erlotinib and palbociclib with an additive effect of combination therapy. Moreover, this combination was efficient in another PDX-TNBC expressing the three biomarkers and resistant to erlotinib alone. Conclusions: We defined a new association of three biomarkers (MT4-MMP/EGFR/RB) expressed together in 50% of TNBC and demonstrated its usefulness to predict the TNBC response to anti-EGFR and anti-CDK4/6 drugs used in single or combined therapy."

We aimed to investigate whether SK4 channels affect TNBC. First, by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blotting (WB), increased SK4 protein expression in breast tumor tissues was detected relative to that in non-tumor breast tissues, but there was no apparent expression difference between various subtypes of breast cancer (p>0.05). Next, functional SK4 channels were detected in the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 using WB, real-time PCR, immunofluorescence and patch-clamp recording. By employing SK4 specific siRNAs and blockers, including TRAM-34 and clotrimazole, in combination with an MTT assay, a colony-formation assay, flow cytometry and a cell motility assay, we found that the suppression of SK4 channels significantly inhibited cell proliferation and migration and promoted apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells (p<0.05). Further investigation revealed that treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF)/basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) caused MDA-MB-231 cells to undergo the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and to show increased SK4 mRNA expression. In addition, the down-regulation of SK4 expression inhibited the EMT markers Vimentin and Snail1. Collectively, our findings suggest that SK4 channels are expressed in TNBC and are involved in the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and EMT processes of TNBC cells."

However, the feature of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) frequently overexpressed in TNBC offers the opportunity to employ lapatinib, a dual-tyrosine kinase inhibitor of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) and EGFR, in the treatment of brain metastasis of TNBC. Unfortunately, the low oral bioavailability of lapatinib and drug efflux by blood-brain barrier have resulted in low drug delivery efficiency into the brain and limited therapeutic effects for patients with brain metastasis in clinical trials. To overcome such disadvantages, we developed lapatinib-loaded human serum albumin (HSA) nanoparticles, named LHNPs, by modified nanoparticle albumin-bound (Nab) technology. LHNPs had a core-shell structure and the new HSA/phosphatidylcholine sheath made LHNPs stable in bloodstream. Compared to free lapatinib, LHNPs could inhibit the adhesion, migration and invasion ability of high brain-metastatic 4T1 cells more effectively in vitro. Tissue distribution following intravenous administration revealed that LHNPs (i.v., 10 mg/kg) achieved increased delivery to the metastatic brain at 5.43 and 4.36 times the levels of Tykerb (p.o., 100 mg/kg) and lapatinib solution (LS, i.v., 10 mg/kg), respectively. Compared to the marketed Tykerb group, LHNPs had markedly better inhibition effects on brain micrometastasis and significantly extended the median survival time of 4T1 brain metastatic mice in consequence. The improved anti-tumor efficacy of LHNPs could be partly ascribed to down-regulating metastasis-related proteins. Therefore, these results clearly indicated that LHNPs could become a promising candidate for clinical applications against brain metastasis of TNBC."

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by a lack of expression of both estrogen (ER) and progesteron (PgR) receptors as well as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Our retrospective analysis addressed prognostic factors for short- and long-term outcomes of patients (pts) with TNBC pts treated in routine clinical practice. Patient and methods. Our retrospective study included 269 TNBC treated at Institute of Oncology Ljubljana between March 2000 and December 2006. The collected data included patients', tumours' and treatments' characteristics. The survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazard model was used in the multivariate analysis. Results. The median age of our patients was 55.3 yrs (23-88.5) and the median follow-up was 5.9 yrs (0.3-9.6). Six (2%) pts experienced local only, 79 (92%) pts distal recurrence and 66 (24%) died. The predominant localisation of the first relapse was in visceral organs (70.4%). The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) for the entire group was 68.2% and the 5-year overall survival (OS) was 74.5%. We found a pattern of high recurrence rate in the first 3 years following the diagnosis and a clear decline in recurrence rate over the next 3 years. In the univariate analysis age, nodal status, size and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were found to have a significant impact on DFS as well as on OS. In the multivariate analysis only age (HR=1.79; 95%CI=1.14-2.82; p=0.012) and nodal status (HR=2.71; 95%CI=1.64-4.46; p<0.001) retained their independent prognostic value for DFS and for OS only the nodal status (HR=2.96; 95%CI=1.51-5.82; p=0.002). Conclusions. In our series of TNBC pts nodal status and age (older than 65 yrs) were found to be independent prognostic factors for DFS, whereas for OS only the nodal status. We found a pattern of a high recurrence rate in the first 3 years following the diagnosis and a decline in the recurrence rate over the next 3 yrs with higher rate of distal versus local recurrence and a predominant localization of distal metastases in visceral organs."

TNBC accounts for approximately 12 to 20 percent of all breast cancer cases. The absence of ER, PR, and HER2 receptors on TNBCs and its ability to develop drug resistance renders it difficult to eradicate or retrogress tumor growth with hormonal therapy and chemotherapy. Triple-negative breast cancer is associated with poorer prognosis, increased chance of relapse, and lower chance of survival. Patients with TNBC have poorer outcome to conventional treatments than patients with other types of breast cancer. Natural killer cell-mediated immunotherapy is a promising therapeutic option for patients with TNBC. Natural killer cells contribute to the immune system by recognizing tumor cells through interactions between ligands on tumor cells and natural killer cell receptors. NK cell function is regulated by a net balance of signals from activating and inhibitory receptors interacting with ligands on target cells. Lectin-like Transcript-1 (LLT1, CLEC2D, OCIL) is a ligand that interacts with NK cell receptor NKRP1A (CD161) and inhibits NK cell activation. In this study, we have identified expression of LLT1 on TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 through flow cytometry, western blot, and confocal microscopy. We have demonstrated that blocking LLT1 on TNBCs with antibodies disrupts interaction with NKRP1A and enhances lysis of TNBCs by primary natural killer cells. We have also shown that a gene knockdown of LLT1 decreases cell surface expression of LLT1 on TNBCs and increases NK cell-mediated lysis of these TNBCs. The results suggest that LLT1 on TNBCs function as a method of evasion from immunosurveillance by NK cells. Blocking LLT1-NKRP1A interaction activates lysis by NK cells and will potentially open a new immunotherapeutic strategy for treatment of TNBC."

We developed patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from residual tumors to identify efficient chemotherapies and predictive biomarkers in a context of resistance to anthracyclines- and taxanes-based treatments. Experimental Design: PDX were established from residual tumors of primary breast cancer patients treated in neoadjuvant setting. TNBC PDX were treated by anthracyclines, taxanes, platins, and capecitabine. Predictive biomarkers were identified by transcriptomic and immunohistologic analysis. Downregulation of RB1 was performed by siRNA in a cell line established from a PDX. Results: Residual TNBC PDX were characterized by a high tumor take, a short latency, and a poor prognosis of the corresponding patients. With the exception of BRCA1/2-mutated models, residual PDX were resistant to anthracyclines, taxanes, and platins. Capecitabine, the oral prodrug of 5-FU, was highly efficient in 60% of PDX, with two models showing complete responses. Prior treatment of a responder PDX with 5-FU increased expression of thymidylate synthase and decreased efficacy of capecitabine. Transcriptomic and IHC analyses of 32 TNBC PDX, including both residual tumors and treatment-naïve derived tumors, identified RB1 and TYMP proteins as predictive biomarkers for capecitabine response. Finally, RB1 knockdown in a cell line established from a capecitabine-responder PDX decreased sensitivity to 5-FU treatment. Conclusions: We identified capecitabine as efficient chemotherapy in TNBC PDX models established from residual disease and resistant to anthracyclines, taxanes, and platins. RB1 positivity and high expression of TYMP were significantly associated with capecitabine response. Clin Cancer Res; 24(11); 2605–15. ©2018 AACR."

Conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy are effective treatments for patients with TNBC. However, the prognosis of TNBC remains unsatisfactory. Therefore, a large volume of research has explored the molecular markers and oncogenic signaling pathways associated with TNBC, including the cell cycle, DNA damage response and androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathways, to identify more efficient targeted therapies. However, whether these predicted pathways are effective targets has yet to be confirmed. In the present review, potentially carcinogenic signaling pathways in TNBCs from previous reports were considered, and ultimately five tumorigenic signaling pathways were selected, specifically receptor tyrosine kinases and downstream signaling pathways, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and associated pathways, the immunoregulatory tumor microenvironment, DNA damage repair pathways, and AR and coordinating pathways. The conclusions of the preclinical and clinical trials of each pathway were then consolidated. Although a number of signaling pathways in TNBC have been considered in preclinical and clinical trials, the aforementioned pathways account for the majority of the malignant behaviors of TNBC. Identifying the alterations to different carcinogenic signaling pathways and their association with the heterogeneity of TNBC may facilitate the development of optimal precision medical approaches for patients with TNBC, potentially improving the efficiency of anticancer therapy."

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is most the aggressive type of breast cancer and is poorly responsive to endocrine therapeutics; however, one of the most attractive treatments is tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-based therapies. To identify compounds that enhance the efficacy of TRAIL-based therapies, we screened 55 compounds from natural products in combination with TRAIL in TNBC cells.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human TNBC cells, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231, and murine TNBC cells, 4T1, were used. Cell viability, apoptotic cells, and cell cycle were quantified by the WST-1 assay, annexin-V/7-amino-actinomycinD (7-AAD) staining and Propidium iodide (PI) staining, respectively. In vivo effects of piperine were evaluated in the orthotopic-inoculated 4T1-luc mouse model.


RESULTS
After screening, we identified piperine as the most potent adjuvant at enhancing the efficacy of TRAIL-based therapies in TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo, which might be mediated through inhibition of survivin and p65 phosphorylation.

Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) do not represent a single disease subgroup and are often aggressive breast cancers with poor prognoses. Unlike estrogen/progesterone receptor and HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) breast cancers, which are responsive to targeted treatments, there is no effective targeted therapy for TNBC, although approximately 50% of patients respond to conventional chemotherapies, including taxanes, anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, and platinum salts.


CONTENT
Genomic studies have helped clarify some of the possible disease groupings that make up TNBC. We discuss the findings, including copy number-transcriptome analysis, whole genome sequencing, and exome sequencing, in terms of the biological properties and phenotypes that make up the constellation of TNBC. The relationships between subgroups defined by transcriptome and genome analysis are discussed.


SUMMARY
TNBC is not a uniform molecular or disease entity but a constellation of variably well-defined biological properties whose relationship to each other is not understood. There is good support for the existence of a basal expression subtype, p53 mutated, high-genomic instability subtype of TNBC. This should be considered a distinct TNBC subtype. Other subtypes with variable degrees of supporting evidence exist within the nonbasal/p53wt (wild-type p53) TNBC, including a group of TNBC with PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) pathway activation that have better overall prognosis than the basal TNBC. Consistent molecular phenotyping of TNBC by whole genome sequencing, transcriptomics, and functional studies with patient-derived tumor xenograft models will be essential components in clinical and biological studies as means of resolving this heterogeneity."

Due to the loss of expression of receptors, treatment options for TNBC are limited. Therefore, finding safe and effective treatments for patients with TNBC is a major objective for clinicians. Previous studies suggested that cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells may be beneficial for patients with a variety of tumor types. However, CIK therapy is not effective for all patients. In this study, we found that focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that regulates several cellular functions in different cells, has the potential to regulate tumor cells sensitized to CIK cells. Knockdown of FAK expression in TNBC cells or the treatment of TNBC cells with a FAK inhibitor followed by coculture with CIK cells increases death of TNBC cells, suggesting that FAK plays important roles in sensitizing tumor cells to CIK cells. This phenomenon could be regulated by a FAK-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-related mechanism. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the cytotoxic effect of CIK cell therapy in TNBC treatment, and show that CIK cell therapy combined with FAK inhibitors may be a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with TNBC."

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive disease, nevertheless exhibiting a high response rate to chemotherapy. Since the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) loss confers a high sensitivity to chemotherapy regimens, we evaluated the prevalence of pRb loss in TNBCs and its relevance on the clinical outcome of patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
pRb status was prospectively evaluated by immunocytochemistry in 518 consecutive patients with complete receptor information. The predictive value of pRb status in TNBCs was determined according to the adjuvant therapeutic treatments.


RESULTS
Fifty-three tumors were identified as TNBCs. The prevalence of pRb loss was significantly higher in TNBCs than in the other cancer subtypes. All patients with TNBCs lacking pRb and treated with systemic chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil) were disease free at a medium follow-up time of 109 months, whereas the clinical outcome of those expressing pRb was significantly poorer (P = 0.008). Analysis of disease-free survival including the established anatomo-clinical prognostic parameters indicated pRb loss as the only significant predictive factor.


CONCLUSIONS
pRb loss is much more frequent in TNBCs than in the other breast cancer subtypes. Patients with TNBCs lacking pRb had a very favorable clinical outcome if treated with conventional adjuvant chemotherapy."

Many patients with TNBC relapse quickly and commonly develop metastases. There are no individualized targeted adjuvant or induction treatments for TNBC, and the current treatments are highly toxic. Development of chemoprevention methods using natural products would be beneficial to patients at risk of TNBC. To investigate the inhibitory effect of blueberries on inflammation-induced TNBC and identify the mechanism underlying modulation of inflammatory proteins by blueberries, we induced a proinflammatory microenvironment by feeding female MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice a high fat western diet (W) with 5% whole blueberry powder (BB) and studied the effect on tumor formation and metastasis. We showed that mice fed a BB diet had significantly smaller tumors, less ulceration, and significantly less metastasis to the inguinal lymph nodes than mice fed a W diet. In BB-fed mice, serum levels of specific antiinflammatory cytokines were increased and specific cytokine expression was also altered. Together, these results suggest that blueberries may inhibit TNBC and TNBC-related metastasis by reducing inflammation via specific cytokine-driven pathways and thus reduce tumor growth and metastasis."

All-in-one covalent nanodrugs of the third generation have been synthesized based on a poly(β-l-malic acid) (PMLA) platform, targeting human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). They significantly inhibited tumor growth in nude mice by blocking synthesis of epidermal growth factor receptor, and α4 and β1 chains of laminin-411, the tumor vascular wall protein and angiogenesis marker. PMLA and nanodrug biocompatibility and toxicity at low and high dosages were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.

The monitoring of TNBC treatment in vivo with different drugs included blood hematologic and immunologic analysis after multiple intravenous administrations. The present study demonstrates that the dual-action nanoconjugate is highly effective in preclinical TNBC treatment without side effects, supported by hematologic and immunologic assays data.

TNBC disproportionately affects younger women and women of colour, and new treatments are needed. The opioid growth factor (OGF) – opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr) axis is a determinant of cell proliferation in neoplasia, and OGF is an endogenously produced pentapeptide that inhibits cell replication by interacting with OGFr and upregulating cyclin-dependent inhibitory kinase pathways thus reducing DNA synthesis. In these studies we investigated the presence and function of the OGF-OGFr axis in two human TNBC cell lines, as well as in breast cancer cell lines containing hormonal receptors. TNBC cell lines MDA-MD-231 and BT-20, as well as human breast cancer cells SK-BR-3 and MCF-7, were examined for the presence of pentapeptide and receptors, as well as their response to OGF. Specificity of peptide and receptor was confirmed by antibody neutralization and molecular studies to knockdown classical receptor protein. The requirement for protein transcription and translation and RNA transcription were investigated. Growth of TNBC cells in the presence of OGF and standard of care chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel was evaluated to determine both efficacy and protective effects against toxicity. OGF treatment inhibited TNBC cells in a dosage related, receptor mediated, and reversible manner. OGF was the specific endogenous opioid to inhibit cell proliferation, and this was mediated by p21 cyclin dependent inhibitory kinase pathways, and required protein and RNA synthesis. OGFr was the specific receptor involved; both peptide and receptor were detected in all four cell lines. OGF treatment inhibited growth of all cancer cell lines evaluated, and reduced cell death in cultures exposed to paclitaxel. The OGF-OGFr axis is present and functioning in TNBC cell lines, and provides a novel biological pathway as potential therapy."

It is a heterogeneous group of tumors with diverse histology, molecular uniqueness and response to treatment. Unfortunately, TNBC patients do not benefit from current anti-HER2 or hormone positive targeted breast cancer treatments; consequently, these patients rely primarily on chemotherapy. However, the 5-year survival rate for woman with metastatic TNBC is less than 30%. As a result of ineffective treatments, TNBC tumors often progress to metastatic lesions in the brain and lung. Brain metastases of invasive breast cancer are associated with 1 and 2 year survival rate of 20% and <2% respectively. Because the only current systemic treatment for TNBC is chemotherapy, alternative targeted therapies are urgently needed to improve the prognosis for TNBC patients.

Drugs inhibiting tyrosine kinases, such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and KIT, have shown some promising results for patients with TNBC. The aim of the study was to investigate whether gains and/or amplifications of VEGFR2 and KIT, located at 4q12, occur in TNBC. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to quantify gene copy numbers of VEGFR2 and KIT in 83 primary human breast cancers including 31 TNBCs. Gains were defined as ≥4 gene copies in >40% of the cancer cells, whereas amplification was defined as CEP >2 in more than 10% of the cancer cells. A tumor was considered FISH positive for KIT and/or VEGFR2 if it displayed copy number gain and/or amplification. Ten (32%) of the TNBCs were VEGFR2 FISH positive and nine (29%) were KIT FISH positive, whereas non‐TNBCs were FISH positive for VEGFR2 and KIT in nine (18%) cases for both genes, but no significant difference between TNBCs and non‐TNBCs was found. FISH positivity for VEGFR2 and KIT was significantly correlated (χ2 test, P < 0.001), and significantly related to ER negativity and high Nottingham histological grade (NHG). A significantly worse 5‐year breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) was seen for FISH positive cases. Increased copy number of VEGFR2 and KIT thus has the potential of functioning as a novel predictive biomarker for selected targeted therapy particularly in the difficult‐to‐treat TNBC patient category. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Combination of anti-angiogenesis and immunotherapy holds promise for effective inhibition of tumor proliferation and invasion, while it remains challenging for specific targeting drug delivery to tumors and metastatic lesions. Here, a multifunctional biomimetic liposome loading Gambogic acid (G/R-MLP) was developed using Ginsenoside Rg3 (Rg3) to substitute cholesterol and cancer cell membrane coating, which was designed to increase long-circulating action by a low immunogenicity and specifically deliver Gambogic acid (GA) to tumor site and metastatic lesions by homologous targeting and glucose transporter (GLUT) targeting. After G/R-MLP accumulated in the primary tumors and metastatic nodules, it synergistically enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of GA, effectively suppressing the tumor growth and lung metastasis by killing tumor cells, inhibiting tumor cell migration and invasion, achieving anti-angiogenesis and improving the anti-tumor immunity. All in all, the strategy combining chemotherapy, anti-angiogenesis and immunotherapy improved therapeutic efficiency and prolonged survival, providing a new perspective for the clinical treatment of TNBC.

Based on CTNeoBC pooled analysis data, the achievement of pathologic CR (pCR) in TNBC is directly linked to improved survival outcomes. Therefore, the treatment paradigm for early TNBC has shifted to neoadjuvant treatment, and the escalation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to improve the pCR rate and the addition of post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy to control the residual disease have been investigated.

This study is the first to identify a novel circular RNA (circRNA), circTBC1D14, whose expression is significantly upregulated in TNBC. The authors confirm that high circTBC1D14 expression is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. circTBC1D14‐associated mass spectrometry and RNA‐binding protein‐related bioinformatics strategies indicate that FUS can interact with circTBC1D14, which can bind to the downstream flanking sequence of circTBC1D14 to induce cyclization. FUS is an essential biomarker associated with stress granules (SGs), and the authors find that hypoxic conditions can induce FUS–circTBC1D14‐associated SG formation in the cytoplasm after modification by protein PRMT1. Subsequently, circTBC1D14 increases the stability of PRMT1 by inhibiting its K48‐regulated polyubiquitination, leading to the upregulation of PRMT1 expression. In addition, FUS–circTBC1D14 SGs can initiate a cascade of SG‐linked proteins to recognize and control the elimination of SGs by recruiting LAMP1 and enhancing lysosome‐associated autophagy flux, thus contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and promoting tumor progression in TNBC. Overall, these findings reveal that circTBC1D14 is a potential prognostic indicator that can serve as a therapeutic target for TNBC treatment."

Nanotechnology‐assisted photothermal therapy (PTT) opens new opportunities for precise cancer treatment. However, thermoresistance caused by PTT, as well as uncertainty in the physiological metabolism of existing phototherapeutic nanoformulations, severely limit their clinical applications. Herein, based on the clinically chemotherapeutic drug mitoxantrone (MTO), a multifunctional nanoplatform (MTO‐micelles) is developed to realize mutually synergistic mild‐photothermal chemotherapy. MTO with excellent near‐infrared absorption (≈669 nm) can function not only as a chemotherapeutic agent but also as a photothermal transduction agent with elevated photothermal conversion efficacy (ƞ = 54.62%). MTO‐micelles can accumulate at the tumor site through the enhanced permeability and retention effect. Following local near‐infrared irradiation, mild hyperthermia (<50 °C) assists MTO in binding tumor cell DNA, resulting in chemotherapeutic sensitization. In addition, downregulation of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) expression due to enhanced DNA damage can in turn weaken tumor thermoresistance, boosting the efficacy of mild PTT. Both in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that MTO‐micelles possess excellent synergetic tumor inhibition effects. Therefore, the mild‐photothermal chemotherapy strategy based on MTO‐micelles has a promising prospect in the clinical transformation of TNBC treatment."

Historically, capecitabine has been the cornerstone of adjuvant therapy for TNBC patients not achieving a pathological complete response (pCR). However, the integration of new modalities such as immunotherapy and PARP inhibitors has prompted a re-evaluation of traditional post-neoadjuvant approaches. Methods: This review synthesizes data from pivotal clinical trials and meta-analyses to evaluate the efficacy of emerging therapies in the post-neoadjuvant setting. We focus on the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), PARP inhibitors (PARPis), and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) alongside or in place of capecitabine in TNBC treatment paradigms. Results: The addition of ICIs like pembrolizumab to neoadjuvant regimens has shown increased pCR rates and improved event-free survival, posing new questions about optimal post-neoadjuvant therapies. Similarly, PARPis have demonstrated efficacy in BRCA-mutated TNBC populations, with significant improvements in disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Emerging studies on ADCs further complicate the adjuvant landscape, offering potentially efficacious alternatives to capecitabine, especially in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy. Discussion: The challenge remains to integrate these new treatments into clinical practice effectively, considering factors such as drug resistance, patient-specific characteristics, and socio-economic barriers. This review discusses the implications of these therapies and suggests a future direction focused on personalized medicine approaches in TNBC. Conclusions: As the treatment landscape for TNBC evolves, the role of capecitabine is being critically examined. While it remains a viable option for certain patient groups, the introduction of ICIs, PARPis, and ADCs offers promising alternatives that could redefine adjuvant therapy standards. Ongoing and future trials will be pivotal in determining the optimal therapeutic strategies for TNBC patients with residual disease post-neoadjuvant therapy."

Taxane and anthracycline-containing chemotherapy (CT) is currently the main systemic treatment option for TNBC, while platinum-based chemotherapy showed promising results in the neoadjuvant and metastatic settings. An early arising of intrinsic or acquired CT resistance is common and represents the main hurdle for successful TNBC treatment. Numerous mechanisms were uncovered that can lead to the development of chemoresistance. These include cancer stem cells (CSCs) induction after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, hypoxia and avoidance of apoptosis, single factors such as tyrosine kinase receptors (EGFR, IGFR1), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10), and a few pathological molecular pathways. Some biomarkers capable of predicting resistance to specific chemotherapeutic agents were identified and are expected to be validated in future studies for a more accurate selection of drugs to be employed and for a more tailored approach, both in neoadjuvant and advanced settings. Recently, based on specific biomarkers, some therapies were tailored to TNBC subsets and became available in clinical practice: olaparib and talazoparib for BRCA1/2 germline mutation carriers larotrectinib and entrectinib for neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusion carriers, and anti-trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (Trop2) antibody drug conjugate therapy for heavily pretreated metastatic TNBC (mTNBC). Further therapies targeting some pathologic molecular pathways, apoptosis, miRNAS, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), and androgen receptor (AR) are under investigation. Among them, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and EGFR inhibitors as well as antiandrogens showed promising results and are under evaluation in Phase II/III clinical trials.

This article documents the treatment regimens of TNBC along with their efficacy towards different subtypes of TNBC, and the various nanotechnologies employed to increase the therapeutic outcome of FDA-approved drug regimens."

It has a limited therapeutic index owing to its extreme toxicity and the emergence of drug resistance. As a result, there is a pressing need to find innovative drugs that enhance the effectiveness of doxorubicin while minimizing its toxicity. The rationale of the present study is that combining emerging treatment agents or repurposed pharmaceuticals with doxorubicin might increase susceptibility to therapeutics and the subsequent establishment of improved pharmacological combinations for treating triple-negative breast cancer. Additionally, combined treatment will facilitate dosage reduction, reducing the toxicity associated with doxorubicin. Recently, the third-generation retinoid adapalene was reported as an effective anticancer agent in several malignancies. This study aimed to determine the anticancer activity of adapalene in TNBC cells and its effectiveness in combination with doxorubicin, and the mechanistic pathways in inhibiting tumorigenicity. Adapalene inhibits tumor cell growth and proliferation and acts synergistically with doxorubicin in inhibiting growth, colony formation, and migration of TNBC cells. Also, the combination of adapalene and doxorubicin enhanced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species triggering hyperphosphorylation of Erk1/2 and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that adapalene is a promising antitumor agent that may be used as a single agent or combined with present therapeutic regimens for TNBC treatment."

Despite progress on the underlying tumor biology, clinical outcomes for TNBC unfortunately remain poor. The median overall survival for patients with metastatic TNBC is approximately eighteen months. Chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment while there is a growing body of evidence that targeted therapies may be on the horizon with poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and immune check-point inhibitors already established in the treatment paradigm of TNBC. A large number of novel therapeutic agents are being evaluated for their efficacy in TNBC. As novel therapeutics are now incorporated into clinical practice, it is clear that tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution can result to de novo or acquired treatment resistance. As precision medicine and next generation sequencing is part of cancer diagnostics, tailored treatment approaches based on the expression of molecular markers are currently being implemented in clinical practice and clinical trial design. The scope of this review is to highlight the most relevant current knowledge regarding underlying molecular profile of TNBC and its potential application in clinical practice."

Although target-based therapeutic options are approved for other cancers, only limited therapeutic options are available for TNBC. Cell signaling and receptor-specific targets are reportedly effective in patients with TNBC under specific clinical conditions. However, most of these cancers are unresponsive, and there is a requirement for more effective treatment modalities. Further, there is a lack of effective biomarkers that can distinguish TNBC from other BC subtypes. ER, PR, and HER2 help identify TNBC and are widely used to identify patients who are most likely to respond to diverse therapeutic strategies. In this review, we discuss the possible treatment options for TNBC based on its inherent subtype receptors and pathways, such as p53 signaling, AKT signaling, cell cycle regulation, DNA damage, and programmed cell death, which play essential roles at multiple stages of TNBC development. We focus on poly-ADP ribose polymerase 1, androgen receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, and epidermal growth factor receptor as well as the application of nanomedicine and immunotherapy in TNBC and discuss their potential applications in drug development for TNBC."

The role played by the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and its cognate receptor IGF-1R in TNBC has been reported. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms by which the IGF-1/IGF-1R system may contribute to TNBC progression still remains to be fully understood. By computational analysis of the vast cancer genomics information in public databases (TCGA and METABRIC), we obtained evidence that high IGF-1 or IGF-1R levels correlate with a worse clinical outcome in TNBC patients. Further bioinformatics analysis revealed that both the focal adhesion and the Hippo pathways are enriched in TNBC harboring an elevated expression of IGF-1 or IGF-1R. Mechanistically, we found that in TNBC cells, the IGF-1/IGF-1R system promotes the activation of the FAK signal transduction pathway, which in turn regulates the nuclear accumulation of YAP (yes-associated protein/yes-related protein) and the expression of its target genes. At the biological level, we found that the IGF-1/IGF-1R-FAK-YAP network cascade triggers the growth potential of TNBC cells, as evaluated in different experimental systems. Overall, our results suggest that the IGF-1/IGF-1R/FAK/YAP axis may contribute to the progression of the aggressive TNBC subtype."

Furthermore, we have also investigated the HuR therapeutic relevance in TNBCs, which is an aggressive breast cancer subtype. Using an online meta-analysis tool, we found that HuR protein overexpression positively correlates with reduced overall survival of TNBC patients (p = 0.028). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the TNBC breast cancer cell lines i.e., MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 are good model systems to study HuR protein, as they both exhibit a significant amount of cytoplasmic HuR (active form). Quercetin treatment significantly inhibited the cytoplasmic HuR in both TNBC cell lines. By using specific HuR siRNA, we established that quercetin-mediated inhibition of adhesion and migration of TNBC cells is dependent on HuR. Upon analyzing adhesion proteins i.e., β-catenin and CD44, we found that quercetin mediated effect on TNBC adhesion and migration was through the HuR-β-catenin axis and CD44, independently. Overall, the present results demonstrate that elevated HuR levels are associated with TNBC progression and relapse, and the ability of quercetin to inhibit cytoplasmic HuR protein provides a rationale for using it as an anticancer agent for the treatment of aggressive TNBCs.

TNBC (Triple-negative breast cancer) has limited treatment options and still lacks viable molecular targets, leading to poor outcomes. Recently, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have been shown to play crucial roles in human cancers, including BC, by modulating a number of oncogenic phenotypes. This suggests that RBPs represent potential molecular targets for BC therapy. Methods: We employed genomic data to identify RBPs specifically expressed in TNBC. NONO was silenced in TNBC cell lines to examine cell growth, colony formation, invasion, and migration. Gene expression profiles in NONO-silenced cells were generated and analyzed. A high-throughput screening for NONO-targeted drugs was performed using an FDA-approved library. Results: We found that the NONO RBP is highly expressed in TNBC and is associated with poor patient outcomes. NONO binds to STAT3 mRNA, increasing STAT3 mRNA levels in TNBC. Surprisingly, NONO directly interacts with STAT3 protein increasing its stability and transcriptional activity, thus contributing to its oncogenic function. Importantly, high-throughput drug screening revealed that auranofin is a potential NONO inhibitor and inhibits cell growth in TNBC. Conclusions: NONO is an RBP upstream regulator of both STAT3 RNA and protein levels and function. It represents an important and clinically relevant promoter of growth and resistance of TNBCs. NONO is also therefore a potential therapeutic target in TNBC."

Experimental discovery of molecular signatures including the ‘BRCAness’ highlighted the innate heterogeneity of TNBC, generating the diversity of TNBC phenotypes. As it contributes to enhancing genomic instability, it has widened the therapeutic spectrum of TNBC. In particular, unusual sensitivity to DNA damaging agents was denoted in patients with BRCA deficiency, suggesting therapeutic benefit from platinum and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors. However, regardless of enriched chemosensitivity and immunogenicity, majority of patients with TNBC still suffer from dismal clinical outcomes including early relapse and metastatic spread. Therefore, efforts into more precise and personalised treatment are critical at this point. Accordingly, the advance of multiomics has revealed novel actionable targets including PI3K-Akt-mTOR and epidermal growth factor receptor signalling pathways, which might actively participate in modulating the chemosensitivity and immune system. Also, TNBC has long been considered a potential protagonist of immunotherapy in breast cancer, supported by abundant tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and heterogeneous tumour microenvironment. Despite that, earlier studies showed somewhat unsatisfactory results of monotherapy with immune-checkpoint inhibitors, consistently durable responses in responders were noteworthy. Based on these results, further combinatorial trials either with other chemotherapy or targeted agents are underway. Incorporating immune-molecular targets into combination as well as refining the standard chemotherapy might be the key to unlock the future of TNBC. In this review, we share the current and upcoming treatment options of TNBC in the framework of scientific and clinical data, especially focusing on early stage of TNBC."

Nuclear localized class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) enzymes, particularly HDACs 1, 2, 3 deacetylate chromatin histones, are overexpressed in cancers and epigenetically regulate the expression of genes involved in cancer initiation and progression. The specific HDAC inhibitor, entinostat, has been shown to attenuate tumor progression and metastasis in TNBC. In this study, we hypothesized that entinostat would enhance the expression of anti-angiogenic and tumor suppressor genes and would thus suppress VM structures in TNBC cells in a 3D Matrigel cell culture preclinical model. Our data indicated that invasive triple-negative MDA-MB-231, LM2-4 and BT-549 breast cancer cells, but not poorly invasive luminal MCF-7 cells, efficiently underwent matrix-associated VM formation. Approximately 80% of TNBC cells with the stem cell phenotype potential formed vessel-like structures when mixed with Matrigel and cultured in the low attachment tissue culture plate. The molecular mechanisms of VM formation are rather complex, while angiogenesis inhibitor genes are downregulated and pro-angiogenesis genes are upregulated in VM-forming cells. Our data revealed that treatment of the TNBC VM phenotype cells with entinostat epigenetically led to the re-expression of the anti-angiogenic genes, serpin family F member 1 (SERPINF1) and thrombospondin 2 (THBS2), and to that of the tumor suppressor genes, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and p21, and reduced VM structures. We also found that treatment of the TNBC VM phenotype cells with entinostat downregulated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), and that of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes, Vimentin and β-catenin. METABIRC and TCGA breast cancer cohort mRNA expression data analysis revealed that a high expression of the anti-angiogenesis-associated genes, THBS2, SERPINF1 and serpin family B member 5 (SERPINB5), and of the tumor suppressor gene, PTEN, was associated with a better overall survival (OS) of breast cancer patients. Taken together, the findings of this study demonstrate that HDACs 1, 2, 3 partly contribute to VM formation in TNBC cells; thus, HDACs may be an important therapeutic target for TNBC."

High rates of metastasis, poor prognosis, and drug resistance are the major problems associated with TNBC. The current chemotherapeutics eliminate only the bulk tumor cells (non-BCSCs) and do not affect breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). The BCSCs which are left behind after chemotherapy is reported to promote recurrence and metastasis of TNBC. Death receptor-5 (DR-5) is exclusively expressed in TNBCs and mediates the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. DR-5, therefore, can be exploited for targeted drug delivery and to induce apoptosis. Gamma-secretase mediated Notch signaling in BCSCs regulates its proliferation, differentiation, and metastasis. The endogenous ligand, Delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4), is reported to activate this Notch signaling in TNBC. Blocking this signaling pathway using both gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) and DLL4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) may produce synergistic benefits. Further, the GSIs (DAPT, LY-411575, RO4929097, MK0752, etc.) suffer from poor bioavailability and off-target side effects such as diarrhea, suppression of lymphopoiesis, headache, hypertension, fatigue, and ventricular dysfunctions. In this hypothesis, we discuss Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) based drug delivery systems containing GSIs and surface modified with DR-5 and DLL4 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to effectivity target and treat TNBC. The delivery system is designed to deliver the drug cargo precisely to TNBCs through its DR-5 receptors and hence expected to reduce the off-target side effects of GSIs. Further, DLL4 mAb and GSIs are expected to act synergistically to block the Notch signal mediated BCSCs proliferation, differentiation, and metastasis."

The presence of one or more of these receptors suggests that a treatment targeting these pathways might be effective, while the absence of, or in the case of HER2, lack of overexpression of, all of these receptors, termed triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), indicates a need for the more toxic chemotherapy. In an effort to develop targeted therapies for TNBC, it will be necessary to differentiate among specific TNBC subtypes. The subset of TNBC that expresses androgen receptor (AR) has been determined to express genes consistent with a luminal subtype and therefore may be amenable to therapies targeting either AR, itself, or other pathways typical of a luminal subtype. Recent investigations of the AR signal pathway within breast cancer lead to AR as a significant target for breast cancer therapy with several clinical trials currently in progress. The subclass of TNBC that lacks AR, which we have termed quadruple negative breast cancer (QNBC) currently lacks a defined targetable pathway. Unlike AR-positive TNBC, QNBC predominantly exhibits a basal-like molecular subtype. Several subtypes and related pathway proteins are preferentially expressed in QNBC that may serve as effective targets for treatment, such as ACSL4, SKP2 and EGFR. ACSL4 expression has been demonstrated to be inversely correlated with expression of hormone/growth factor receptors and may thus serve as a biomarker for QNBC as well as a target for therapy. In the following review we summarize some of the current efforts to develop alternatives to chemotherapy for TNBC and QNBC."

Treatment with functional liposomes silenced the expression of Slug and Slug protein, inhibited the TGF-β1/Smad pathway, and inhibited invasiveness and growth of TNBC cells. In TNBC cancer-bearing mice, functional miRNA liposomes exerted a stronger anticancer effect than functional vinorelbine liposomes, and combination therapy with these two formulations resulted in nearly complete inhibition of tumor growth. Preliminary safety evaluations indicated that the functional miRNA liposomes did not affect body weight or cause damage to any major organs. Furthermore, the functional liposomes significantly increased the half-life of the drug in the blood of cancer-bearing nude mice, and increased drug accumulation in breast cancer tissues. Conclusion: In this study, we constructed novel functional miRNA liposomes. These liposomes silenced Slug expression and inhibited the TGF-β1/Smad pathway in TNBC cells, and enhanced anticancer efficacy in mice using combined chemotherapy. Hence, the present study demonstrated a promising strategy for gene therapy of invasive breast cancer."

For years, TNBC has been considered to be a difficult-to-treat tumour due to its generally aggressive tumour biology and in view of limited therapeutic options. The risk of recurrence and metastasis is higher than in the case of other breast cancer subtypes of the same stage. In addition to surgery and radiation in the curative situation, systemic chemotherapy with anthracyclines and/or taxanes is still the therapy of choice. New therapeutic approaches are based on the knowledge that TNBC is a molecularly very heterogeneous disease. Research groups are working to classify TNBC better and better on a molecular level and use this molecular subtyping as the basis for new therapeutic strategies. The most promising new approaches and considerations regarding the therapy of TNBCs are shown below. In addition, the current therapeutic strategies are discussed using a fictitious case history, taking the current data and the resultant therapeutic consequence into account. Zusammenfassung Durch den raschen Erkenntnisgewinn zu Tumorbiologie und Tumorpathogenese des triple-negativen Mammakarzinoms (TNBC) ergeben sich neue Therapieansätze und neue Therapiekonzepte für die Behandlung. Seit Jahren gilt das TNBC wegen seiner in der Regel aggressiven Tumorbiologie und angesichts limitierter Therapieoptionen als schwierig zu behandelnder Tumor. Das Rezidiv- und Metastasierungsrisiko ist höher als bei anderen Mammakarzinom-Subtypen desselben Stadiums. Neben Operation und Bestrahlung in der kurativen Situation ist die systemische Chemotherapie mit Anthrazyklinen und/oder Taxanen nach wie vor die Therapie der Wahl. Neue Therapieansätze basieren auf der Erkenntnis, dass das TNBC eine molekular sehr heterogene Erkrankung ist. Forschungsgruppen arbeiten daran, das TNBC immer besser auf molekularer Ebene zu klassifizieren und diese molekulare Subtypisierung als Grundlage für neue therapeutische Strategien zu nutzen. Im Folgenden werden die vielversprechendsten neuen Ansätze und Überlegungen zur Therapie des TNBCs dargestellt. Anhand einer fiktiven Kasuistik werden zudem die derzeitigen Therapiestrategien unter Berücksichtigung der aktuellen Datenlage und den sich daraus ergebenden therapeutischen Konsequenz besprochen."

Atezolizumab (atezo) is a humanized mAb that inhibits the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 and B7.1, thus restoring tumor-specific T-cell immunity. Atezo was evaluated in an expansion cohort of mTNBC patients (pts) in a Phase Ia study (NCT01375842). Methods. Enrollment was initially limited to TNBC pts with PD-L1 on ≥5% of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (IC2/3), then opened to pts regardless of PD-L1 status. Pts received atezo IV in 1L or 2L+ q3w at 15 or 20 mg/kg or 1200 mg for 1 y with option to be retreated at PD, or until loss of clinical benefit. ORR was assessed by RECIST v1.1 and irRC, to capture non-conventional responses. Baseline PD-L1 expression on IC was centrally scored as IC0/1/2/3 (VENTANA SP142 assay). Pretreatment tumors and on-therapy biopsies were evaluated for TILs, CD8 T cells and macrophages by IHC. Results. As of Mar 31, 2016, 115 mTNBC pts were safety evaluable; atezo was generally well tolerated. There were no additional safety signals from prior report (Emens AACR 2015). 112 pts with FU ≥12 wk were evaluable for response. Based on irRC, ORR in 1L and 2L+ pts were 26% and 11%, respectively. ORR for PD-L1 IC2/3 pts were 17% vs 8% in IC0/1. mDoR was 21.1 mo (3 to 34+). mOS of responders (n=15) was not reached (4+ to 37+ mo) with no deaths as of data cutoff. mOS of non-responders who lived ≥ 6 wk (n=87) was 9 mo (1+ to 19+ mo). OS rates in all pts at 1, 2, and 3 y were 41%, 22% and 22%, respectively. OS rates at 1, 2, and 3 y for PD-L1 IC2/3 were 45%, 28% and 28%, respectively. Pts whose tumors had >10% TILs or ≥1.35% CD8 in the tumor center trended toward higher ORR and longer OS. Atezo increased intratumoral TILs, CD8, macrophages and IC PD-L1 expression, but no response association was observed. Conclusions. In mTNBC, atezo was well tolerated. Responders showed durable clinical benefit. Response rates were higher in 1L or PD-L1 IC2/3 pts. Baseline TILs and CD8 were associated with greater clinical benefit.

The management of TNBC represents a challenge due to its aggressive phenotype, heterogeneity and lack of targeted therapy. Loss of cell differentiation and enrichment with breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSC) are features of TNBC contributing to its aggressive nature. Here, we found that PRL treatment of TNBC cells to significantly depletes the highly tumorigenic BCSC subpopulations CD44+/CD24- and ALDH+ and differentiate them to the least tumorigenic CD44-/CD24- and ALDH- phenotype with limited tumorsphere formation and self-renewal capacities. Importantly, we found PRL to induce a heterochromatin phenotype marked by histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and accompanied by ultrastructural cellular architecture associated with differentiation and senescence rendering the cells refractory to growth signals. Crucially, we found PRL to mediate these effects in vivo in a preclinical animal xenograft of TNBC controlling tumor growth. These results reveal that the lactogenic hormone PRL may exert its anti-tumorigenic effects in TNBC through cellular reprogramming indicative of differentiation resulting in depletion of BCSCs and restricting tumorigenesis."

Bevacizumab adds to the efficacy of chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer; however, there is limited data on the safety or efficacy of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. Thus, we sought to explore the safety and efficacy of the addition of bevacizumab to cisplatin in the treatment of TNBC.


METHODS
51 patients (pts) with confirmed TNBC provided informed consent and were enrolled in a single arm phase II trial of neoadjuvant cisplatin 75 mg/m2 q 3 weeks x 4 cycles and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg q 3 weeks x 3 cycles prior to definitive surgery. Only 3 cycles of bevacizumab were delivered to allow 6 weeks between the last dose of bevacizumab and surgery. Research biopsies were obtained and breast MRI performed before treatment and at surgery. Postoperatively, pts received doxorubicin and cytoxan (AC) plus bevacizumab or AC/Taxol plus bevacizumab. Median age was 50 yrs (range 30 to 66 yrs); tumors were clinical T1 (2%), T2 (80%), T3 (18%).


RESULTS
Forty-six pts are evaluable for response and 5 pts are still receiving neoadjuvant therapy. Clinical responses to date: 12/46 (26%) clinical complete response (cCR), 24/46 (52%) clinical partial response (cPR), 5/46 (11%) stable disease (SD), and 1/46 (2%) progressive disease (PD). Non-responders included 4/46 (9%) pts who discontinued protocol therapy for toxicity. To date, 7/46 (15%) pts achieved a complete pathological response (Miller-Payne 5) and an additional 10/46 (22%) were Miller-Payne 4. Five pts did not complete neoadjuvant therapy, 2 with tinnitus/hearing loss and 3 with grade 4 toxicities consisting of refractory hypertension in 1 pt and pulmonary embolism (PE) in 2 pts. Tissue-based assays to predict platinum/bevacizumab responses, including BRCA1/2 status, are underway.


CONCLUSIONS
Cisplatin and bevacizumab has some activity in TNBC as demonstrated by 37% of evaluable pts with a Miller-Payne 4 or 5 pathological response. However, toxicity, including tinnitus/hearing loss, hypertension and PE, limited completion of neoadjuvant therapy in 11% of pts. No significant financial relationships to disclose."

The lack of targeted therapies available for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients who fail to respond to first-line chemotherapy has sparked interest in immunotherapeutic approaches. However, trials utilizing checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in TNBC have had underwhelming responses. Here, we investigated the interplay between type I IFN signaling and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and tested the impact of combining IFN inducers, as immune activators, with anti–PD-1, to induce an antimetastatic immune response. Using models of TNBC, we demonstrated an interplay between type I IFN signaling and tumor cell PD-L1 expression that affected therapeutic response. The data revealed that the type I IFN-inducer poly(I:C) was an effective immune activator and antimetastatic agent, functioning better than anti–PD-1, which was ineffective as a single agent. Poly(I:C) treatment induced PD-L1 expression on TNBC cells, and combined poly(I:C) and anti–PD-1 treatment prolonged metastasis-free survival in a neoadjuvant setting via the induction of a tumor-specific T-cell response. Use of this combination in a late treatment setting did not impact metastasis-free survival, indicating that timing was critical for immunotherapeutic benefit. Together, these data demonstrated anti–PD-1 as an ineffective single agent in preclinical models of TNBC. However, type I IFN inducers were effective immune activators, and neoadjuvant trials combining them with anti–PD-1 to induce a sustained antitumor immune response are warranted.

While targeted therapies for TNBC are in various stages of development, current standard chemotherapies include taxanes such as paclitaxel and anthracycline agents. With the objective of specifically targeting invasive cancer, our group has been developing small-molecule inhibitors of the Rho GTPases Rac and Cdc42, which are known drivers of cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Of these, MBQ-167 inhibits both Rac and Cdc42 with IC50s of 103 and 78 nmol/L, respectively, and consequently inhibits p21-activated kinase (PAK) signaling, metastatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, tumor growth, and metastasis (Humphries-Bickley et al., Mol Cancer Ther 2017). We found that in addition to blocking HER2-type breast cancer progression, MBQ-167 is also highly effective against TNBC cell and tumor growth, as well as metastasis in mouse models. The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of MBQ-167 in combination with the current chemotherapeutic paclitaxel. We hypothesized that the combination of paclitaxel and MBQ-167 is a rational strategy to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in TNBC. To test this hypothesis, we administered a nontoxic dosage of individual MBQ-167, paclitaxel, or combined MBQ-167 and paclitaxel to immunocompromised mice bearing mammary fat pad tumors from GFP-tagged MDA-MB-468 or MDA-MB-231 human TNBC cells. Tumor growth was monitored weekly and metastasis was quantified at the end of the study. Treatment with MBQ-167 and/or paclitaxel resulted in reduced tumor growth by 70-80% in both models. In the MDA-MB-231 model, MBQ-167 paralleled paclitaxel treatment with a modest benefit in combined therapy. However, in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive TNBC model MDA-MB-468, MBQ-167 alone or in combination significantly reduced metastasis to the lungs and spleen, while paclitaxel alone increased metastasis to the liver, lungs, and spleen. These results show that MBQ-167 is a promising antimetastatic agent that can be effective in combination with current chemotherapeutic agents.

In this study, we investigated the predictive factor of recurrence in TNBC using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-imaging mass spectrometry for lipid profiling of breast cancer specimens obtained from three and six patients with recurrent and non-recurrent TNBC, respectively. The signal for phosphatidylcholine (PC) (32:1) at m/z 732.5 was significantly higher in the recurrence group compared to the non-recurrence group (P = 0.024).

Introduction: TNBC is a mutationally complex breast cancer subtype with poor prognosis and no current targeted therapy options. Compared with other intrinsic breast cancer subtypes, TNBC has higher programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels, which may hinder antitumor T-cell responses. MPDL3280A is a monoclonal anti-PDL1 antibody, engineered for optimized efficacy and safety, that blocks signaling through the PD-L1/PD-1 and PD-L1/B7.1 pathways.

Methods: MPDL3280A was tested in a metastatic TNBC expansion cohort as part of a multicenter Phase Ia study. Pts received MPDL3280A at 15 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg or 1200 mg flat dose IV q3w. AEs were summarized for the safety follow-up duration from the first dose to 30 days after the last dose before the clinical cutoff on Sept 2, 2014. Responses were assessed by RECIST v1.1 criteria in pts who received MPDL3280A by Jul 21, 2014, evaluable for efficacy (≥ 6-wk follow-up). PD-L1 expression on tumor-infiltrating immune cells (ICs) at baseline was centrally evaluated by IHC in archival or fresh biopsies, and pts were scored as PD-L1 IHC (IC) 0, 1, 2 or 3. Peripheral biomarkers were assayed using FACS and multiplex immunoassays.

Results: In the TNBC cohort, 27 pts were selectively enrolled. These pts had a median age of 48 y (29-82 y) and were evaluable for safety; 52% had ECOG PS 0 and 44% had ECOG PS 1. Visceral and bone metastases were present at baseline in 59% and 11% of pts, respectively. In addition, 85% received ≥ 4 prior systemic regimens (neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic), including anthracyclines (78%), taxanes (82%) and platinum agents (15% cisplatin, 41% carboplatin). All-grade treatment-related AEs occurred in 67% of pts, most frequently fatigue (22%), pyrexia (15%), neutropenia (15%) and nausea (15%). 11% of pts experienced a Grade 3-5 related AE (5 Grade 3 events: adrenal insufficiency, neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, decreased WBC count; 1 Grade 5 pulmonary hypertension event in a pt with an atrial septal defect). Among 21 efficacy-evaluable PD-L1 IHC 2 or 3 pts (13 IHC 2 and 8 IHC 3), the unconfirmed RECIST ORR was 24% (95% CI, 8% to 47%); 3 PRs and 2 CRs were observed. Response duration ranged from 0.1+ to 41.6+ wks, with the median not yet reached. Pts with evidence of durable nonclassical responses suggestive of pseudoprogression were also observed. Overall, the 24-wk PFS rate was 33% (95% CI, 12% to 53%). Biomarker analysis revealed transient elevation of plasma cytokines and proliferating CD8 cells following MPDL3280A treatment. Updated clinical data, including PD-L1-negative pts, will be presented.

Conclusions: MPDL3280A was generally well tolerated and demonstrated promising efficacy in pretreated metastatic PD-L1 IHC 2 or 3 TNBC pts. Furthermore, circulating biomarker analyses revealed pharmacodynamic responses to MPDL3280A. Clinical evaluation of MPDL3280A in metastatic PD-L1 IHC 0 or 1 TNBC is ongoing ([NCT01375842][1]).

Our previous study showed that downregulating syndecan-binding protein (SDCBP) in TNBC inhibits the proliferation of TNBC cells. Dasatinib is a new small-molecule inhibitor of c-src phosphorylation. The aim of this study was to investigate if SDCBP is a potential marker to indicate whether a TNBC is suitable for dasatinib therapy. This study applied co-immunoprecipitation to identify the interaction between SDCBP and c-src in TNBC cell lines. In addition, immunohistochemistry was used to investigate SDCBP and tyrosine-419 phosphorylated c-src (p-c-src-Y419) expression in TNBC tissues. SDCBP-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells were then constructed to evaluate the effects of dasatinib on SDCBP-induced TNBC progression in vitro and tumor formation in nude mice. We found wild-type SDCBP interacted with c-src and promoted the phosphorylation of c-src; this phosphorylation was completely blocked by dasatinib. SDCBP lacking the PDZ domain had no such effect. Among the 52 consecutive random TNBC cases examined, the expression of SDCBP was consistent with that of p-c-src-Y419, and positively correlated with histological grading or Ki-67 levels. SDCBP overexpression significantly accelerated the proliferation and cell cycle progression of the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231; these effects were prevented by dasatinib treatment. However, the subsequent inhibition of p27 expression partially restored the proliferation and viability of the TNBC cells. The results of this study suggest that SDCBP interacts with c-src, regulates G1/S in TNBC cells, and enhances tumor cell proliferation by promoting the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-src at residue 419. Dasatinib inhibits such phosphorylation and blocks SDCBP-induced cell cycle progression. Therefore, SDCBP might be an important marker for identifying TNBC cases that are suitable for dasatinib therapy."

However, the utility of CEA and CA15-3 levels as conventional cancer biomarkers in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains controversial. The current study was performed to explore the predictive value of pre-therapeutic serum CEA and CA15-3 levels, and nomograms were developed including these serum cancer biomarkers to improve the prognostic evaluation of TNBC patients. Pre-therapeutic CA15-3 and CEA concentrations were measured in 247 patients with stage I–IV TNBC. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that TNBC patients with high levels of both CEA and CA15-3 had shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates than those in the low-level groups (p<0.05). Multivariate analysis suggested that pre-therapeutic CA15-3 and CEA levels are independent predictive elements for OS (p = 0.022 and p = 0.040, respectively) and DFS (p = 0.023 and p = 0.028, respectively). In addition, novel nomograms were established and validated to provide personal forecasts of OS and DFS for patients with TNBC. These novel nomograms may help physicians to select the optimal treatment plans to ensure the best outcomes for TNBC patients."
MiR-27a Modulates Radiosensitivity of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) Cells by Targeting CDC27,"[{'authorId': '46300922', 'name': 'Yong-qiang Ren'}, {'authorId': '2083632068', 'name': 'Fengkui Fu'}, {'authorId': '1780602', 'name': 'Jianjun Han'}]",54,2015,57bc34cf82d275ac24009ca2858f1c180c4cc42c,"Background MiR-27a is significantly overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the exact biological function of MiR-27a in TNBC is not fully understood. In this study, we verified miR-27a expression in TNBC cells and explored how its overexpression modulates radiosensitivity of the cells. Material/Method qRT-PCR analysis was performed to study miR-27a expression in TNBC lines MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 and in normal human breast epithelial cell line MCF10A. Dual luciferase assay was performed to verify a putative downstream target of miR-27a, CDC27. CCK-8 assay was used to assess the influence of miR-27a-CDC27 axis on cell proliferation under irradiation (IR) treatment. Results We confirmed significantly higher miR-27a expression in 2 TNBC cell lines – MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 – than in human breast epithelial cell line MCF10A. miR-27a could modulate proliferation and radiosensitivity of TNBC cells. CDC-27 is a direct target of miR-27a and its downregulation conferred increased radioresistance of the cells. Conclusions The miR-27a-CDC27 axis might play an important role in modulating response to radiotherapy in TNBC cells. Testing miR-27a expression might be a useful way to identify a subgroup of patients who will benefit from an IR-based therapeutic approach."

There is a vital need for effective targeted therapeutics for TNBC patients, yet treatment strategies are challenged by the significant intertumoral heterogeneity within the TNBC subtype and its surrounding microenvironment. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) are highly expressed in several TNBC subtypes and are promising therapeutic targets. In this study, we targeted the MET receptor, which is highly expressed across several TNBC subtypes. Experimental Design: Using the small-molecule inhibitor cabozantinib (XL184), we examined the efficacy of MET inhibition in preclinical models that recapitulate human TNBC and its microenvironment. To analyze the dynamic interactions between TNBC cells and fibroblasts over time, we utilized a 3D model referred to as MAME (Mammary Architecture and Microenvironment Engineering) with quantitative image analysis. To investigate cabozantinib inhibition in vivo, we used a novel xenograft model that expresses human HGF and supports paracrine MET signaling. Results: XL184 treatment of MAME cultures of MDA-MB-231 and HCC70 cells (± HGF-expressing fibroblasts) was cytotoxic and significantly reduced multicellular invasive outgrowths, even in cultures with HGF-expressing fibroblasts. Treatment with XL184 had no significant effects on METneg breast cancer cell growth. In vivo assays demonstrated that cabozantinib treatment significantly inhibited TNBC growth and metastasis. Conclusions: Using preclinical TNBC models that recapitulate the breast tumor microenvironment, we demonstrate that cabozantinib inhibition is an effective therapeutic strategy in several TNBC subtypes.

However, this treatment is ineffective for unknown reasons. Here, we report that aberrant expression of wingless-type MMTV integration site family (WNT) and activated WNT signals, which crosstalk with the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway through GSK3β, plays the most critical role in resistance to pan-PI3K inhibitors in TNBC cells. GDC-0941 is a pan-PI3K inhibitor that activates the WNT/beta-catenin pathway in TNBC cells through stimulation of WNT secretion. GDC-0941-triggered WNT/beta-catenin pathway activation was observed in MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells, which are TNBC cell lines showing aberrant WNT/beta-catenin activation, and not in SKBR3 and MCF7 cells. This observation is further investigated in vivo. GDC-0941 exhibited minimal tumor inhibition in MDA-MB-231 cells, but it significantly suppressed tumor growth in HER-positive SK-BR3 cells. In vivo mechanism study revealed the activation of WNT/beta-catenin pathway by GDC-0941. A synergistic effect was observed when combined treatment with GDC-0941 and the WNT inhibitor LGK974 at low concentrations in MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings indicated that WNT pathway activation conferred resistance in TNBC cells treated with GDC-0941. This resistance may be further circumvented through combined treatment with pan-PI3K and WNT inhibitors. Future clinical trials of these two inhibitors are warranted."

EndoTAG-1, composed of paclitaxel embedded in liposomal membranes targeting tumor endothelial cells, was evaluated for safety and efficacy in advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
One hundred and forty patients were treated with weekly EndoTAG-1 (22 mg/m(2)) plus paclitaxel (70 mg/m(2)), twice weekly EndoTAG-1 (2× 44 mg/m(2)), or weekly paclitaxel (90 mg/m(2)) for greater than or equal to four cycles (3-week treatment + 1-week rest) or until progression/toxicity. Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) rate evaluated centrally after four cycles of therapy (week 16). The study was not powered for intergroup comparisons.


RESULTS
The PFS rate at week 16 was 59.1% [one-sided 95% CI: 45.6, ∞] on combination treatment, 34.2% [21.6, ∞] on EndoTAG-1, and 48.0% [30.5, ∞] on paclitaxel. Median PFS reached 4.2, 3.4, and 3.7 months, respectively. After complete treatment (week 41 analysis), median overall survival (OS) was 13.0, 11.9, and 13.1 months for the modified Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population and 15.1, 12.5, and 8.9 months for the per-protocol population, respectively. The clinical benefit rate was 53%, 31%, and 36% for the treatment groups. Safety analysis revealed known toxicities of the drugs with slight increases of grade 3/4 neutropenia on combination therapy.


CONCLUSION
Treatment of advanced TNBC with a combination of EndoTAG-1 and standard paclitaxel [Taxol® (Bristol-Myers Squibb GmbH), or equivalent generic formulation] was well tolerated and showed antitumor efficacy. The positive trend needs to be confirmed in a randomized phase III trial.

Thus, pCR rates may be useful in evaluating novel regimens in TNBC. In advanced TNBC, platinum analogues like Cb are active and addition of B to chemotherapy increases response rates and time to progression. CALGB 40603 is a 2×2 randomized phase II study designed to determine if the addition of either Cb or B to standard NAC significantly increases pCR rates in TNBC.

The lack of expression of targetable proteins such as the estrogen receptor and absence of HER2 amplification have made relying on cytotoxic chemotherapy necessary for decades. In the operable setting, efforts to improve outcomes have focused on escalation of systemic therapy and a shift toward preoperative delivery followed by a response adapted approach to postoperative systemic therapy. An improved understanding of tumor biology has resulted in the identification of subsets of patients with specific molecular features, leading to testing and approval of multiple new targeted therapies for this disease. Furthermore, advances in drug development have led to the approval of antibody-drug conjugates that are redefining classification schemes for breast cancer. This review focuses on the modern management of TNBC, with particular focus on recent updates in the treatment of operable disease, and an overview of the most recent promising advances in the therapeutic landscape of metastatic disease. It discusses the practical challenges and unanswered questions resulting from the approval of neoadjuvant immunotherapy and shares an approach in the clinic on topics for which evidence is lacking. In addition, it provides a glimpse into the future, highlighting challenges and opportunities for biomarker based right-sizing of preoperative therapy, refining evaluation of response to preoperative therapy after surgery, early diagnosis and detection of relapse, and areas of needed research for metastatic TNBC."

The survival rate for TNBC is generally worse than other breast cancer subtypes. TNBC treatment has made significant advances, but certain limitations remain. Treatment for TNBC can be challenging since the disease has various molecular subtypes. A variety of treatment options are available, such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. Chemotherapy is the most common of these options. TNBC is generally treated with systemic chemotherapy using drugs such as anthracyclines and taxanes in neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings. Developing resistance to anticancer drugs and off-target toxicity are the primary hindrances to chemotherapeutic solutions for cancer. It is imperative that researchers, clinicians, and pharmaceutical companies work together to develop effective treatment options for TNBC.

Embase, Medline and Web of Science were searched for articles published between January 2010 and August 2022. The articles had to meet the following criteria: patients with primary invasive TNBC without distant metastases and patients must have received NAC. In total, 2045 articles were screened by two reviewers resulting in the inclusion of 92 articles. Overall, the most frequently reported biomarkers associated with a pCR were a high expression of Ki-67, an expression of PD-L1 and the abundance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, particularly CD8+ T cells, and corresponding immune gene signatures. In addition, our review reveals proteomic, genomic and transcriptomic markers that relate to cancer cells, the tumor microenvironment and the peripheral blood, which also affect chemo-sensitivity. We conclude that a prediction model based on a combination of tumor and immune markers is likely to better stratify TNBC patients with respect to NAC response."

Among the novel therapies that have been approved for the clinical management of TNBC, immunotherapy shows great potential. Although exciting progress has been made in immunotherapy for TNBC, there are still gaps to fill. This review will analyze current immunotherapy strategies in TNBC, summarize the current landscape of clinical trials, review the results achieved, and shed light on future developments. Abstract Due to the absence of hormone receptor (both estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors) along with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) amplification, the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cannot benefit from endocrine or anti-HER-2 therapy. For a long time, chemotherapy was the only systemic treatment for TNBC. Due to the lack of effective treatment options, the prognosis for TNBC is extremely poor. The successful application of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) launched the era of immunotherapy in TNBC. However, the current findings show modest efficacy of programmed cell death- (ligand) 1 (PD-(L)1) inhibitors monotherapy and only a small proportion of patients can benefit from this approach. Based on the basic principles of immunotherapy and the characteristics of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in TNBC, immune combination therapy is expected to further enhance the efficacy and expand the beneficiary population of patients. Given the diversity of drugs that can be combined, it is important to select effective biomarkers to identify the target population. Moreover, the side effects associated with the combination of multiple drugs should also be considered."

In recent years, emphasis has been placed on the identification of mechanisms underlying the complex genomic and biological profile of TNBC, aiming to tailor treatment strategies. High immunogenicity, specific immune activation signatures, higher expression of immunosuppressive genes and higher levels of stromal Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes, constitute some of the key elements of the immune driven landscape associated with TNBC. The unprecedented response of TNBC to immunotherapy has undoubtedly changed the standard of care in this disease both in the early and the metastatic setting. However, the extent of interplay between immune infiltration and mutational signatures in TNBC is yet to be fully unravelled. In the present review, we present clinical evidence on the immunogenicity and tumour microenvironment influence on TNBC progression and the current treatment paradigms in TNBC based on immunotherapy."

We identified an unexpected protein vulnerability in p53-inactivated TNBC and designed a new PROTAC to target it. Our PROTAC selectively targets MDM2 for proteasome-mediated degradation with high-affinity binding and VHL recruitment. MDM2 loss in p53 mutant/deleted TNBC cells in 2D/3D culture and TNBC patient explants, including relapsed tumors, causes apoptosis, while sparing normal cells. Our MDM2-PROTAC is stable in vivo, and treatment of TNBC xenograft-bearing mice demonstrates tumor on-target efficacy with no toxicity to normal cells, significantly extending survival. Transcriptomic analyses revealed upregulation of p53 family target genes. Investigations showed activation and a required role for TAp73 to mediate MDM2-PROTAC-induced apoptosis. Our data, challenging the current MDM2/p53 paradigm, show MDM2 is required for p53-inactivated TNBC cell survival, and PROTAC-targeted MDM2 degradation is an innovative potential therapeutic strategy for TNBC and superior to existing MDM2 inhibitors."

In recent years, immunotherapy has emerged as a new treatment option for patients with TNBC. However, this therapeutic evolution is paralleled by a growing need for biomarkers which allow for a better selection of patients who are most likely to benefit from this immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based regimen. These biomarkers will not only facilitate a better optimization of treatment strategies, but they will also avoid unnecessary side effects in non-responders, and limit the increasing financial toxicity linked to the use of these agents. Huge efforts have been deployed to identify predictive biomarkers for the ICI, but until now, the fruits of this labor remained largely unsatisfactory. Among clinically validated biomarkers, only programmed death-ligand 1 protein (PD-L1) expression has been prospectively assessed in TNBC trials. In addition to this, microsatellite instability and a high tumor mutational burden are approved as tumor agnostic biomarkers, but only a small percentage of TNBC fits this category. Furthermore, TNBC should no longer be approached as a single biological entity, but rather as a complex disease with different molecular, clinicopathological, and tumor microenvironment subgroups. This review provides an overview of the validated and evolving predictive biomarkers for a response to ICI in TNBC."

We determined that intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1), a cell surface receptor overexpressed in TNBC, efficiently facilitates receptor-mediated antibody internalization. We next constructed a panel of four ICAM1 ADCs using different chemical linkers and warheads and compared their in vitro and in vivo efficacies against multiple human TNBC cell lines and a series of standard, late-stage, and refractory TNBC in vivo models. An ICAM1 antibody conjugated with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a protease-cleavable valine-citrulline linker was identified as the optimal ADC formulation owing to its outstanding efficacy and safety, representing an effective ADC candidate for TNBC therapy."

This cancer is responsible for more than 15–20% of all breast cancers and is of particular research interest as it is therapeutically challenging mainly because of its low response to therapeutics and highly invasive nature. The non-availability of specific treatment options for TNBC is usually managed by conventional therapy, which often leads to relapse. The focus of this review is to provide up-to-date information related to TNBC epidemiology, risk factors, metastasis, different signaling pathways, and the pathways that can be blocked, immune suppressive cells of the TNBC microenvironment, current and investigation therapies, prognosis, and the role of artificial intelligence in TNBC diagnosis. The data presented in this paper may be helpful for researchers working in the field to obtain general and particular information to advance the understanding of TNBC and provide suitable disease management in the future."

Immune checkpoint inhibition has been demonstrated to be an effective anticancer strategy. Several lines of evidence support the study of immunotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We assessed the safety and antitumor activity of the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor pembrolizumab in patients with advanced TNBC.


METHODS
KEYNOTE-012 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01848834) was a multicenter, nonrandomized phase Ib trial of single-agent pembrolizumab given intravenously at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks to patients with advanced PD-L1-positive (expression in stroma or ≥ 1% of tumor cells by immunohistochemistry) TNBC, gastric cancer, urothelial cancer, and head and neck cancer. This report focuses on the TNBC cohort.


RESULTS
Among 111 patients with TNBC whose tumor samples were screened for PD-L1 expression, 58.6% had PD-L1-positive tumors. Thirty-two women (median age, 50.5 years; range, 29 to 72 years) were enrolled and assessed for safety and antitumor activity. The median number of doses administered was five (range, 1 to 36 doses). Common toxicities were mild and similar to those observed in other tumor cohorts (eg, arthralgia, fatigue, myalgia, and nausea), and included five (15.6%) patients with grade ≥ 3 toxicity and one treatment-related death. Among the 27 patients who were evaluable for antitumor activity, the overall response rate was 18.5%, the median time to response was 17.9 weeks (range, 7.3 to 32.4 weeks), and the median duration of response was not yet reached (range, 15.0 to ≥ 47.3 weeks).


CONCLUSION
This phase Ib study describes preliminary evidence of clinical activity and a potentially acceptable safety profile of pembrolizumab given every 2 weeks to patients with heavily pretreated, advanced TNBC. A single-agent phase II study examining a 200-mg dose given once every 3 weeks (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02447003) is ongoing."

One third of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) achieve pathologic complete response (pCR) with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). CALGB 40603 (Alliance), a 2 × 2 factorial, open-label, randomized phase II trial, evaluated the impact of adding carboplatin and/or bevacizumab.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients (N = 443) with stage II to III TNBC received paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) once per week (wP) for 12 weeks, followed by doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide once every 2 weeks (ddAC) for four cycles, and were randomly assigned to concurrent carboplatin (area under curve 6) once every 3 weeks for four cycles and/or bevacizumab 10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks for nine cycles. Effects of adding these agents on pCR breast (ypT0/is), pCR breast/axilla (ypT0/isN0), treatment delivery, and toxicities were analyzed.


RESULTS
Patients assigned to either carboplatin or bevacizumab were less likely to complete wP and ddAC without skipped doses, dose modification, or early discontinuation resulting from toxicity. Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were more common with carboplatin, as were hypertension, infection, thromboembolic events, bleeding, and postoperative complications with bevacizumab. Employing one-sided P values, addition of either carboplatin (60% v 44%; P = .0018) or bevacizumab (59% v 48%; P = .0089) significantly increased pCR breast, whereas only carboplatin (54% v 41%; P = .0029) significantly raised pCR breast/axilla. More-than-additive interactions between the two agents could not be demonstrated.


CONCLUSION
In stage II to III TNBC, addition of either carboplatin or bevacizumab to NACT increased pCR rates, but whether this will improve relapse-free or overall survival is unknown. Given results from recently reported adjuvant trials, further investigation of bevacizumab in this setting is unlikely, but the role of carboplatin could be evaluated in definitive studies, ideally limited to biologically defined patient subsets most likely to benefit from this agent."

In this study, we sought to define TNBC subtypes and identify subtype-specific markers and targets. Experimental Design: RNA and DNA profiling analyses were conducted on 198 TNBC tumors [estrogen receptor (ER) negativity defined as Allred scale value ≤ 2] with >50% cellularity (discovery set: n = 84; validation set: n = 114) collected at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX). An external dataset of seven publically accessible TNBC studies was used to confirm results. DNA copy number, disease-free survival (DFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS) were analyzed independently using these datasets. Results: We identified and confirmed four distinct TNBC subtypes: (i) luminal androgen receptor (AR; LAR), (ii) mesenchymal (MES), (iii) basal-like immunosuppressed (BLIS), and (iv) basal-like immune-activated (BLIA). Of these, prognosis is worst for BLIS tumors and best for BLIA tumors for both DFS (log-rank test: P = 0.042 and 0.041, respectively) and DSS (log-rank test: P = 0.039 and 0.029, respectively). DNA copy number analysis produced two major groups (LAR and MES/BLIS/BLIA) and suggested that gene amplification drives gene expression in some cases [FGFR2 (BLIS)]. Putative subtype-specific targets were identified: (i) LAR: androgen receptor and the cell surface mucin MUC1, (ii) MES: growth factor receptors [platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor A; c-Kit], (iii) BLIS: an immunosuppressing molecule (VTCN1), and (iv) BLIA: Stat signal transduction molecules and cytokines. Conclusion: There are four stable TNBC subtypes characterized by the expression of distinct molecular profiles that have distinct prognoses. These studies identify novel subtype-specific targets that can be targeted in the future for the effective treatment of TNBCs. Clin Cancer Res; 21(7); 1688–98. ©2014 AACR.
