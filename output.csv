 Introduction: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive form of breast cancer (BC) that is associated with poor prognosis, accounts for 10-15% of all BCs. Chemotherapy remains the standard of care (SOC) for advanced disease, with limited clinical benefit. Oncology clinical trials (CTs) are globally recommended and encouraged as the preferred treatment (tx) option for any cancer patient (pt). ‘TrialJectory’ (TJ) is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based technology that matches pts to oncology CTs. Here, we identified distinct characteristics of TNBC pts who signed up to the TJ platform compared to non-TNBC pts. Methods: Using AI and an unsupervised natural language processing approach, the TJ platform clinically matches pts to CTs. Matching is achieved by pt response to an online dynamic questionnaire (www.trialjectory.com) that collects detailed clinical data including clinico-pathologic characteristics, tx history, general health, and comorbidities. Those are compared to the eligibility criteria of available CTs to yield a high-quality actionable matched-trial list. Results: Between 1/2020 and 12/2021, out of 9796 BC pts that signed up, 2688 were TNBC pts (27%). There was no significant difference in age at sign-up between TNBC and non-TNBC patients (median age of 57 years vs 58 years, respectively). Consistently with Non-hispanic black (NHB) race prevalence in the different molecular subtypes in the general US population, NHB race had higher signup rate in TNBC compared to non-TNBC (9.95% vs 5.76%, respectively). TNBC pts signed up at a later disease stage compared to non-TNBC pts (19% of TNBC reported having a stage 1 disease compared to 27% of non-TNBC pts, p< 0.001).A significantly higher percentage of pts with advanced/metastatic TNBC signed up to the TJ platform before starting tx compared to non-TNBC patients (34% vs 22%, respectively, p< 0.001). Furthermore, there was a significant difference in the willingness to travel any distance within the US for a matched clinical trial between TNBC and non-TNBC pts (39% vs 34%, respectively, p< 0.001). Conclusions: In this study, we found significant differences in the characteristics of TNBC vs non-TNBC pts that have signed up to the TJ platform. There was an up to 2-fold enrichment of TNBC on the TJ platform pts compared to their frequency in the general population. While previous studies do not show a difference in stage distribution between different subtypes, TNBC patients initiated their search for CTs at a higher stage. In addition, advanced TNBC patients started their search earlier in their journey, before starting chemotherapy. This may reflect the lack of effective SOC and possibly, the motivation to avoid the use of chemotherapy. This is also supported by the willingness of TNBC patients to travel farther in order to identify and enroll in a CT compared to non-TNBC pts. Importantly, the motivation of TNBC pts to travel any distance has not been reduced despite the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting a strong drive of this pt population to enroll in CTs. It also demonstrates that with the right access, diverse patient populations are willing to participate in clinical trials. In sum, TNBC pts are more likely to explore CT options, in the advanced stage setting, earlier in their journey. This study demonstrates the power of TJ platform for clinico-pathologic characterization and diverse pt groups, including their drivers and behavioral choices during their battle with cancer.

However, the data on optimal adjuvant treatment strategies for patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant treatment is limited. Areas covered We discuss the available data on adjuvant treatment for residual TNBC after neoadjuvant treatment considering clinical trials. Additionally, we discuss ongoing trials to give perspectives on how the field may evolve in the next decade. Expert opinion The available data support the use of adjuvant capecitabine for all patients and either adjuvant capecitabine or olaparib for patients with germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, according to availability. The CREATE-X study of capecitabine and OlympiA study of olaparib demonstrated disease-free and overall survival benefits. There is an unmet need for studies comparing these two options for patients with germline BRCA mutations. Further research is needed to delineate the use of immunotherapy in the adjuvant setting, molecular targeted therapy for patients with molecular alterations other than germline BRCA mutation, combinations, and antibody-drug conjugates to further improve outcomes."

The survival rate for TNBC is generally worse than other breast cancer subtypes. TNBC treatment has made significant advances, but certain limitations remain. Treatment for TNBC can be challenging since the disease has various molecular subtypes. A variety of treatment options are available, such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. Chemotherapy is the most common of these options. TNBC is generally treated with systemic chemotherapy using drugs such as anthracyclines and taxanes in neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings. Developing resistance to anticancer drugs and off-target toxicity are the primary hindrances to chemotherapeutic solutions for cancer. It is imperative that researchers, clinicians, and pharmaceutical companies work together to develop effective treatment options for TNBC. Several studies have suggested nanotechnology as a potential solution to the problem of suboptimal TNBC treatment. In this review, we summarized possible treatment options for TNBC, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, combination therapy, and nanoparticle-based therapy, and some solutions for the treatment of TNBC in the future. Moreover, we gave general information about TNBC in terms of its characteristics and aggressiveness."

Over the years, the use of chemotherapy for these patients has demonstrated many adversities, including toxicity and resistance, which suggested the need to develop novel alternative therapeutic options, such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). Herein, we provide an overview on PARPi, mechanisms of action and the role of biomarkers in PARPi sensitivity trials, clinical advances in PARPi therapy for TNBC patients based on the most recent studies and findings of clinical trials, and challenges that prevent PARP inhibitors from achieving high efficacy such as resistance and overlapping toxicities with other chemotherapies. Data sources Searching for relevant articles was done using PubMed and Cochrane Library databases by using the keywords including TNBC; chemotherapy; PARPi; BRCA; homologous recombination repair (HRR). Studies had to be published in full-text in English in order to be considered. Data summary Although PARPi have been used in the treatment of local/metastatic breast malignancies that are HER2 negative and has a germline BRCA mutation, several questions are still to be answered in order to maximize the clinical benefit of PARP inhibitors in TNBC treatment, such as questions related to the optimal use in the neoadjuvant and metastatic settings as well as the best combinations with various chemotherapies. Conclusions PARPi are emerging treatment options for patients with gBRCA1/2 mutations. Determining patients that are most likely to benefit from PARPi and identifying the optimal treatment combinations with high efficacy and fewer side effects are currently ongoing."
Triple negative breast cancer: approved treatment options and their mechanisms of action,"[{'authorId': '2181739608', 'name': 'Aditya Mandapati'}, {'authorId': '4973311', 'name': 'K. Lukong'}]",39,2022,2ca7bf27c3caffcd6228203a03e1782162371680,"Purpose Breast cancer, the most prevalent cancer worldwide, consists of 4 main subtypes, namely, Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-positive, and Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Triple-negative breast tumors, which do not express estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors, account for approximately 15-20% of breast cancer cases. The lack of traditional receptor targets contributes to the heterogenous, aggressive, and refractory nature of these tumors, resulting in limited therapeutic strategies. Methods Chemotherapeutics such as taxanes and anthracyclines have been the traditional go to treatment regimens for TNBC patients. Paclitaxel, docetaxel, doxorubicin, and epirubicin have been longstanding, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies against TNBC. Additionally, the FDA approved PARP inhibitors such as olaparib and atezolizumab to be used in combination with chemotherapies, primarily to improve their efficiency and reduce adverse patient outcomes. The immunotherapeutic Keytruda was the latest addition to the FDA-approved list of drugs used to treat TNBC. Results The following review aims to elucidate current FDA-approved therapeutics and their mechanisms of action, shedding a light on the various strategies currently used to circumvent the treatment-resistant nature of TNBC cases. Conclusion The recent approval and use of therapies such as Trodelvy, olaparib and Keytruda has its roots in the development of an understanding of signaling pathways that drive tumour growth. In the future, the emergence of novel drug delivery methods may help increase the efficiency of these therapies whiel also reducing adverse side effects."

TNBC lacks crucial receptors targeted in other breast cancer types, leading to a poor prognosis and limited treatment options due to its aggressive and heterogeneous nature. Significance African American women (AAW) with TNBC face higher mortality rates and more aggressive disease compared to Caucasian American women (CAW). Despite efforts to find biomarkers specific to AAW and CAW with TNBC, limited sample availability and data resources have been obstacles. Methods In our study, we examined 237 candidate peptide biomarkers using publicly available data. Results identify 23 unique prognostic biomarkers. These biomarkers accurately assess patient conditions based on race-specific gene expression patterns, holding potential to address racial disparities in TNBC treatment. Conclusion Overall, our research sheds light on how racial genetic profiles influence TNBC prognosis and treatment efficacy. The identified prognostic biomarkers pave the way for future studies addressing TNBC racial disparities and personalized treatment approaches."

PARP inhibitors (PARPi), approved to treat patients with HER2- breast cancer with a germline BRCA1/2 (gBRCA1/2) mutation, have not shown efficacy in homologous recombination repair (HRR) proficient tumors. In pre-clinical models, the BET inhibitor (BETi) ZEN-3694 sensitizes wild-type (WT) BRCA1/2 tumors to PARPi through downregulation of HRR gene expression, providing a rationale for combination therapy. We previously reported results from the Ph 1b portion of the trial evaluating the combination of ZEN-3694 plus talazoparib, in TNBC patients without gBRCA1/2 mutations; here we present results from the completed Ph 1b/2 study. Methods: A Ph 1b dose finding portion (n = 15) was followed by a single arm Ph 2 Simon 2-stage portion (n = 17+20 (37)). The primary endpoint of the Ph 1b portion of the study was safety and recommended Ph 2 dose (RP2D). The secondary endpoints were pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and clinical benefit rate (CBR = confirmed objective response rate (ORR) + stable disease > 16 weeks). Ph 2 measured CBR as the primary endpoint, ORR and duration of response (DOR) as key secondary endpoints. Eligibility criteria for Ph 1b included TNBC (ER/PR < 10%, HER2-), WT gBRCA1/2, and > 1 prior cytotoxic regimen for mTNBC, and in the Ph2 portion ER/PR < 1% and < 2 prior cytotoxic regimens for mTNBC. Patients were dosed daily in continuous 28 day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Adverse events, PK, and PD in whole blood and tissue biopsies were assessed. Response endpoints were assessed per RECIST 1.1 every 2 cycles. Results: RP2D was determined to be 48mg qd ZEN-3694 plus 0.75mg qd talazoparib. The most common AE for the Ph 1b/2 study was thrombocytopenia (TCP) (55% any grade, 34% G3/4), which was managed with dose holds and reductions. Dose intensity analysis showed average daily doses of ZEN-3694 and talazoparib could be maintained above 40mg and 0.5mg, respectively, over 8 cycles. Robust target engagement was demonstrated using BET-dependent and HRR transcripts assessed in paired tumor biopsies. Ph 2 portion of the trial met its primary endpoint with a CBR of 30% (11/37). For the Ph 1b/2 trial, investgator assessed ORR was 22% (11/50), including 2 CR, CBR was 35% (18/51) and the median DOR was 24 weeks. For the subset of TNBC at diagnosis patients (no history of HR+ disease), ORR was 32% (11/34), and CBR was 44% (15/34). Conclusions: Combination of ZEN-3694 and talazoparib demonstrated anti-cancer activity in pretreated mTNBC WT gBRCA1/2 patients. All confirmed responses were observed in TNBC at diagnosis patients, whose tumors are expected to be more sensitive to the combination due to their basal-like properties. The trial is being expanded to Ph. 2b to accrue an additional 80 TNBC at diagnosis patients. Clinical trial information: NCT03901469."

Advances in medical science have improved our understanding on the biological nature and heterogeneity of TNBC, explaining the efficacy variability of existing chemotherapeutic drugs on TNBC patients. Complexity of TNBC has led to wide variation of TNBC treatment across the globe, resulting in unsatisfactory treatment outcome. This issue is further complicated by the absence of TNBC treatment guideline in many countries, including in Indonesia. This review discusses systemic treatment options for TNBC while taking account its molecular heterogeneity. Specific consideration is made for Indonesia, not only for current clinical practice, but also for future improvements. Immunotherapy, especially programmed cell death 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitor, has recently shown promising result in TNBC patients. It can be concluded that TNBC is heterogenous and treatment option should be tailored based on its molecular profile."

Introducing biological drugs, targeted treatment and gene therapy can potentially reduce the mortality and improve the quality of life in patients with MBC. However, combination of several types of treatment is usually recommended. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 10–20% of all cases of breast carcinoma and is characterized by the low expression of progesterone receptor (PR), estrogen receptor (ER), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Consequently, convenient treatments used for MBC that target these receptors are not effective for TNBC which therefore requires special treatment approaches. This review discusses the occurrence of MBC, the prognosis and predictive biomarkers of MBC, and focuses on the novel advanced tactics for treatment of MBC and TNBC. Nanotechnology-based combinatorial approach for the suppression of EGFR by siRNA and gifitinib is described."
