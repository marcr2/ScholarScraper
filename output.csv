Therefore, the usual adjuvant treatments for breast cancer, are not applied to TNBC. Recently, it has been found that approximately one third of TNBC tumours express androgen receptor (AR) and it is associated with better response to endocrine therapies. However, the prognostic value of AR expression in TNBC is still unclear. Therefore, in this preliminary study we evaluate the effectiveness of an anti-androgen treatment (bicalutamide) respect to conventional treatments (doxorubicin and lapatinib) in TNBC human cell lines and their corresponding xenografts. Briefly, SUM149, SUM159 and MDAMB231 TNBC cell lines were cultured in supplemented medium. Cells were plated in 96-well plates and a serial dilution of Doxorubicin, Lapatinib, Bicatulamide and respective combinations were added. In addition, 106 cells were implanted subcutaneosly into five female mice (Balb/C SCID). When tumors developed, mice were treated with doxorubicin, bicalutamide, doxorubicin + bicalutamide and doxorubicin + bicalutamide + lapatinib. Every treatment was perfomed every 3 days during 15 days and tumor reduction and appearance of metastases were evaluated. Results from cell culture showed that neoplasic cells from each cell line were high sensitive to bicalutamide treatment (SUM149 EC50: 9,860e009; MDAMB231 EC50: 9,454e009; SUM159 EC50: 2,170e009). Also, viability decreased when we added an anti-androgen (bicalutamide) to the conventional treatments (doxorubicin + lapatinib). In vivo experiments revealed a greater percentage of tumour reduction (around 70%) in mice treated with combination of treatments and a lower appearance of metastasis was observed in this group respect to control group (SUM149: 40% vs 60%; MDA-MB-231: 20% vs 75%; SUM159: 20% vs 60%). Therefore, our preliminary findings suggest that the addition of an anti-androgenic agent to treatments currently in use can reduce the tumour considerably, defining anti-androgenic treatments as a novel effective therapeutic target.

This group experiences a 40% higher mortality rate compared to women of other ethnicities, highlighting a significant disparity, and underscoring the urgent need for the development of targeted, effective treatments, specifically tailored to address these demographic women. Towards this, the efficacy of high intensity, short duration electrical pulses combined with Resveratrol (Resv), a natural polyphenol, as a novel therapeutic agent against TNBC is investigated. Electrical pulses facilitate enhanced drug transport through the opening of pores in cell membrane for those molecules that are normally non-permeable. This approach addresses the challenge of Resv's limited bioavailability and enhances its apoptotic potential. Employing MDA-MB-468 cell line, derived from an African American woman, this study investigates the effects of Resv and electrical pulses (EP) on TNBC cells. The TNBC cells were treated with Resv and subjected to eight pulses of multiple electric fields ranging from 500V/cm to 1200V/cm at 100μs, and at 1Hz, followed by assessments monitoring viability, colony formation, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The results indicate an 84% reduction in live cancer cell viability and a 4-fold increase in ROS levels with the combined treatment, suggesting a promising approach to alternative TNBC therapy. This research evaluates a natural bio compound, along with an advanced drug delivery system, targeting a reduction in mortality rates and improved quality of life for TNBC patients."

However, we are now witnessing the dawn of targeted therapies for TNBC in which progress has stemmed from an improved understanding of the components that make TNBC unique. The identification of biomarkers, such as BRCA1/2, PIK3CA and RSK2, have advanced the field remarkably and there is considerable interest in finding novel therapeutics for TNBC that offer durable clinical benefit with fewer adverse events. Areas covered We discuss phase I/II trials of new and emerging targeted therapies for TNBC, according to ClinicalTrials.gov up to June 2020. Although the emphasis is on ongoing and completed early phase trials, we also highlight pivotal studies that have led to the approval of new targeted classes of drugs for TNBC, with a focus on outcomes and common adverse events of each class of therapy. Expert opinion The way forward for TNBC treatment is through precision medicine. The use of novel agents matched with biomarkers to identify patients with the best chance of sustainable response offers new hope. We now have great potential for improving the outcomes for patients with TNBC."

This heterogeneous disease can be classified into four molecular subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER2 and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)) according to the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) and the progesterone receptor (PR), and the overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Current BC treatments target these receptors (endocrine and anti-HER2 therapies) as a personalized treatment. Along with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, these therapies can have severe adverse effects and patients can develop resistance to these agents. Moreover, TNBC do not have standardized treatments. Hence, a deeper understanding of the development of new treatments that are more specific and effective in treating each BC subgroup is key. New approaches have recently emerged such as immunotherapy, conjugated antibodies, and targeting other metabolic pathways. This review summarizes current BC treatments and explores the new treatment strategies from a personalized therapy perspective and the resulting challenges."
Neoadjuvant treatments for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).,"[{'authorId': '5114713', 'name': 'G.

Historically, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has responded well in the neoadjuvant setting, with rates of pathological complete response (pCR) commonly higher than for other breast tumour types. However, more than half of TNBC patients do not achieve a pCR and have a very poor prognosis. The lack of drug-targetable receptors on TNBC tumours has made improving the available interventions in TNBC an area of important medical need. The routine use of neoadjuvant anthracycline/taxane combinations in TNBC is currently being supplemented by ongoing investigations of their use with other types of agent. In particular, the substantial proportion of TNBC tumours associated with BRCA1 mutations is driving clinical research into the use of DNA-damaging agents such as platinums, as well as of potentiators of DNA damage such as the investigational agent iniparib and inhibitors of poly-ADP ribose polymerase such as olaparib. Tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors and microtubule-targeting inhibitors of cell cycling are also under active investigation. The use of neoadjuvant treatment with pCR as a surrogate of overall survival will allow the rapid evaluation and comparison of these and other much-needed new treatments for TNBC."

The aim of this study was to identify a new specific target for specific treatments. Frozen primary tumors were collected from 83 adjuvant therapy-naive TNBC patients. These samples were used for global proteome profiling by iTRAQ-OFFGEL-LC-MS/MS approach in two series: a training cohort (n = 42) and a test set (n = 41). Patients who remains free of local or distant metastasis for a minimum of 5 years after surgery were classified in the no-relapse group; the others were in the relapse group. OPLS and Kaplan–Meier analyses were performed to select candidate markers, which were validated by immunohistochemistry. Three proteins were identified in the training set and validated in the test set by Kaplan–Meier method and immunohistochemistry (IHC): TrpRS as a good prognostic markers and DP and TSP1 as bad prognostic markers. We propose the establishment of an IHC test to calculate the score of TrpRS, DP, and TSP1 in TNBC tumors to evaluate the degree of aggressiveness of the tumors. Finally, we propose that DP and TSP1 could provide therapeutic targets for specific treatments."

Gene expression profiling has identified at least six different triple-negative subtypes with different biology and sensitivity to therapies. The heterogeneous nature of TN tumors may justify the difficulty in treating this BC subtype. Several targeted agents have been investigated in clinical trials without demonstrating a clear survival benefit. Therefore, systemic chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of current clinical practice. Improving the knowledge of tumor biology is mandatory for patient management. In stages II and III, neoadjuvant systemic treatment is an effective option of care. The achievement of a pathological complete response represents an optimal surrogate for survival outcome as well as a test for tumor drug sensitivity. In this review, we provide a brief description of the main predictive biomarkers for tumor response to systemic treatment. Moreover, we review the treatment strategies investigated for TNBCs in neoadjuvant settings focusing on experimental drugs such as immunotherapy and poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase inhibitors that hold promise in the treatment of this aggressive disease. Therefore, the management of TNBC represents an urgent, current, unmet need in daily clinical practice. A key recommendation is to design biology-driven clinical trials wherein TNBC patients may be treated on the basis of tumor molecular profile."

This acronym simply means that the tumour does not express oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) and does not exhibit amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene. Despite this unambiguous definition, TNBCs are an heterogeneous group of tumours with just one common clinical feature: a distinctly aggressive nature with higher rates of relapse and shorter overall survival in the metastatic setting compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. Because of the absence of well-defined molecular targets, cytotoxic chemotherapy is currently the only treatment option for TNBC. In the last decades, the use of more aggressive chemotherapy has produced a clear improvement of the prognosis in women with TNBC, but this approach results in an unacceptable deterioration in the quality of life, also if some support therapies try to relieve patients from distress. In addition, there is the general belief that it is impossible to further improve the prognosis of TNBC patients with chemotherapy alone. In view of that, there is a feverish search for new “clever drugs” able both to rescue chemo-resistant, and to reduce the burden of chemotherapy in chemo-responsive TNBC patients. A major obstacle to identifying actionable targets in TNBC is the vast disease heterogeneity both inter-tumour and intra-tumour and years of study have failed to demonstrate a single unifying alteration that is targetable in TNBC. TNBC is considered the subtype that best benefits from the neoadjuvant model, since the strong correlation between pathological Complete Response and long-term Disease-Free-Survival in these patients. In this review, we discuss the recent discoveries that have furthered our understanding of TNBC, with a focus on the subtyping of TNBC. We also explore the implications of these discoveries for future treatments and highlight the need for a completely different type of clinical trials."

The adaptability of siRNA nanoparticles enables the delivery of virtually any siRNA, which is especially advantageous for therapeutic applications in heterogeneous diseases that lack unifying molecular features, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are extremely intricate in tumorigenesis and cancerous metastasis. Nonetheless, their roles in the initiation and augmentation of TNBC remain elusive. Here, in silico analysis and validation experiments were utilized to analyze the expression pattern of clinically effective lncRNAs in TNBC, among which a protective lncRNA LYPLAL1-DT was essentially curbed in TNBC samples and indicated a favorable prognosis. Gain- and loss-of-function assays elucidated that LYPLAL1-DT considerably attenuated the proliferative and metastatic properties along with epithelial-mesenchymal transition of TNBC cells. Moreover, forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) was validated to modulate the transcription of LYPLAL1-DT. Mechanistically, LYPLAL1-DT impinged on the malignancy of TNBC mainly by restraining the aberrant reactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, explicitly destabilizing and diminishing β-catenin protein by interacting with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK) and constricting the formation of the hnRNPK/β-catenin complex. Conclusively, our present research revealed the anti-oncogenic effects of LYPLAL1-DT in TNBC, unraveling the molecular mechanisms of the FOXO1/LYPLAL1-DT/hnRNPK/β-catenin signaling axis, which shed innovative light on the potential curative medicine of TNBC."

Ferroptosis has been recognized as a natural barrier for cancer progression and represents a significant role of RT-mediated anticancer effects, while the simultaneous activation of ferroptosis defensive system during RT limits the synergistic effect between RT and ferroptosis. Herein, we engineered a tumor microenvironment (TME) degradable nanohybrid with a dual radiosensitization manner to combine ferroptosis induction and high-Z effect based on metal-organic frameworks for ferroptosis-augmented RT of TNBC. The encapsulated l-buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO) could inhibit glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis for glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) inactivation to break down the ferroptosis defensive system, and the delivered ferrous ions could act as a powerful ferroptosis executor via triggering the Fenton reaction; the combination of them induces potent ferroptosis, which could synergize with the surface decorated Gold (Au) NPs-mediated radiosensitization to improve RT efficacy. In vivo antitumor results revealed that the nanohybrid could significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy and antimetastasis efficiency based on the combinational mechanism between ferroptosis and RT. This work thus demonstrated that combining RT with efficient ferroptosis induction through nanotechnology was a feasible and promising strategy for TNBC treatment."

TNBC is chemotherapy sensitive, and this treatment remains the standard of care despite its limited benefit. Recent advances with novel agents have been made for specific subgroups with PD-L1+ tumors or germline Brca-mutated tumors. However, only a fraction of these patients responds to immune checkpoint or PARP inhibitors and even those who do respond often develop resistance and relapse. Various new agents and combination strategies have been explored to further understand molecular and immunological aspects of TNBC.

At present, comparisons between adjuvant chemotherapy regimens are retrospective in nature, and so the optimal drugs or drug combinations have not been established for patients with early TNBC. In retrospective subgroup analyses, taxanes are more effective than 5-fluorouracil in combination with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin. Classical CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil) has shown efficacy, whereas few data on the role of anthracyclines are available. An unplanned subgroup analysis of one randomised study suggests that capecitabine adds efficacy to a taxane-anthracycline regimen, but this observation requires confirmation. High-dose adjuvant chemotherapy is considered experimental. Ongoing trials are comparing standard adjuvant regimens with regimens that integrate an anti-angiogenic agent, a platin or maintenance capecitabine. Inhibitors of DNA repair or specific tyrosine kinases have not yet been addressed in the adjuvant setting. In the absence of data from prospective trials that focus on adjuvant therapy of early TNBC, several regimens, such as a taxane and an anthracycline-containing regimen or classical CMF may be considered reasonable choices."

These tumors have a more aggressive phenotype and a poorer prognosis due to the high propensity for metastatic progression and absence of specific targeted treatments. Patients with TNBC do not benefit from hormonal or trastuzumab-based targeted therapies because of the loss of target receptors. Although these patients respond to chemotherapeutic agents such as taxanes and anthracyclines better than other subtypes of breast cancer, prognosis remains poor. A group of targeted therapies under investigation showed favorable results in TNBC, especially in cancers with BRCA mutation. The lipid-lowering statins (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors), including lovastatin and simvastatin, have been shown to preferentially target TNBC compared with non-TNBC. These statins hold great promise for the management of TNBC. Only with the understanding of the molecular basis for the preference of statins for TNBC and more investigations in clinical trials can they be reformulated into a clinically approved drug against TNBC."

Owing to the lack of therapeutic targets, chemotherapy and surgical intervention are the only treatments for TNBC. However, the effectiveness of chemotherapeutics is limited by its shortcomings such as poor targeting, easy removal and high toxicity. Recently, exosomes have attracted more and more attention as a drug delivery system. As endogenous vesicles, exosomes ensure low immunogenicity, nontoxicity, and long blood circulation time. In addition, immune cell-derived exosomes can mimic the immune cell to target tumor cells. Herein, we developed a macrophage-derived exosome-coated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoplatform for targeted chemotherapy of TNBC. To further improve the tumor targetability, the surface of the exosome was modified with a peptide to target the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-Met), which is overexpressed by TNBC cells. The results showed that the engineered exosome-coated nanoparticles significantly improved the cellular uptake efficiency and the antitumor efficacy of doxorubicin. In vivo study demonstrated that the nanocarriers exhibited remarkable tumor-targeting efficacy, led to increased inhibition of tumor growth and induced intense tumor apoptosis. These results indicated that the engineered macrophage exosome-coated nanoparticles were a promising drug delivery strategy for TNBC treatment."

TNBC is characterized by a wide range of genetic, immunophenotypic, morphological, and clinical features. TNBC is coined to describe cancers that lack estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). As a result, hormonal or trastuzumab-based treatments are ineffective in TNBC patients. TNBCs are biologically aggressive, and despite some evidence that they respond to treatment better than other forms of breast cancer, the prognosis remains poor. This is attributed to a shorter disease-free interval in adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings, as well as a more aggressive metastatic course. TNBC has a lot of clinical ramifications. In terms of new treatment methods, TNBC has lagged behind other types of breast cancer. There are not many options for treating this form of breast cancer because it is progressive. Many effective treatments for most breast cancers block the growth-stimulating effects of ER, PR, and/or HER2, leaving TNBC with few choices. Finding new and effective treatment options for TNBC remains a critical clinical need. To develop more effective drugs, new experimental approaches must be tested in patients with TNBC."

Thus, better stratification systems that reflect intrinsic and clinically useful differences between TNBC tumors will sharpen the treatment approaches and improve clinical outcomes. The lack of a rational classification system for TNBC also impacts current and emerging therapeutic alternatives. In the past years, several new methodologies to stratify TNBC have arisen thanks to the implementation of microarray technology, high-throughput sequencing, and bioinformatic methods, exponentially increasing the amount of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic information available. Thus, new TNBC subtypes are being characterized with the promise to advance the treatment of this challenging disease. However, the diverse nature of the molecular data, the poor integration between the various methods, and the lack of cost-effective methods for systematic classification have hampered the widespread implementation of these promising developments. However, the advent of artificial intelligence applied to translational oncology promises to bring light into definitive TNBC subtypes. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the available classification strategies. It includes evaluating the overlap between the molecular, immunohistochemical, and clinical characteristics between these approaches and a perspective about the increasing applications of artificial intelligence to identify definitive and clinically relevant TNBC subtypes."

This review article surveys the latest evidence concerning the role of genomic alteration in current TNBC treatment responses, current clinical trials and potential targeting sites, CSC and drug resistance, and potential strategies targeting CSCs in TNBC.

Although patients with TNBC show sensitivity to some chemotherapy regimens, in early-stage disease greater emphasis is placed on locoregional treatments, based on surgery and radiation therapy (RT). Ongoing improvements in both screening and surgical techniques have reduced the need for radical surgical intervention in all breast cancers, and breast-conserving surgery (BCS) followed by RT is now increasingly common for all tumour types. However, while evidence has clearly established the importance of post-surgical RT for favourable long-term outcomes in breast cancer, it is less well-established as to where and under which conditions more radical surgeries than BCS, such as modified radical mastectomy (MRM), may be indicated for TNBC. A high proportion of TNBC tumours are BRCA1-mutated and therefore patients with this type of tumour are at a potentially elevated risk of ipsilateral or contralateral recurrence. In addition, while some studies indicate that post-BCS locoregional TNBC relapse rates generally appear similar to other tumour types, some evidence suggests that distant relapse rates may be higher. There is evidence that some subtypes of TNBC may require MRM rather than BCS for optimal long-term outcomes. More research is needed to establish whether TNBC-specific approaches to locoregional treatment may be required."

Due to absence of targetable hormone receptor expression, chemotherapy is the current standard of care for TNBC. However, recurrence and metastasis following treatment with chemotherapy and radiation remain major contributors to mortality. To develop more effective treatments of TNBC, molecular pathways involved in tumor growth, vascularization, and apoptosis have been investigated as potential targets. In this review, we outline promising biological targets that may be implicated in future TNBC treatments. Abstract Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive form of breast cancer. Due to its heterogeneity and lack of hormone receptor expression, this subtype is more likely to metastasize and resist treatment attempts than are other forms of breast cancer. Due to the absence of targetable receptors, chemotherapy and breast conserving surgery have been the predominant treatment options for patients. However, resistance to chemotherapy and local recurrence of the tumors is frequent. Emerging immunotherapies have begun to change treatment plans for patients diagnosed with TNBC. In this review, we discuss the various immune pathways identified in TNBC and the role they play as targets for new potential treatment choices. Various therapeutic options that inhibit key pathways in cellular growth cycles, DNA repair mechanisms, epithelial mesenchymal transition, and immunosuppression have been shown to improve survival in patients with this disease. With promising results thus far, continued studies of immunotherapy and neoadjuvant therapy options for TNBC are likely to alter the treatment course for these diagnoses in the future."

It is generally considered to be the most difficult breast cancer subtype to deal with, due to the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which usually direct targeted therapies. In this scenario, the current treatments of TNBC-affected patients rely on tumor excision and conventional chemotherapy. As a result, the prognosis is overall poor. Thus, the identification and characterization of targets for novel therapies are urgently required. The Notch signaling pathway has emerged to act in the pathogenesis and tumor progression of TNBCs. Firstly, Notch receptors are associated with the regulation of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) behavior, as well as with the aetiology of TNBCs. Secondly, there is a strong evidence that Notch pathway is a relevant player in mammary cancer stem cells maintenance and expansion. Finally, Notch receptors expression and activation strongly correlate with the aggressive clinicopathological and biological phenotypes of breast cancer (e.g., invasiveness and chemoresistance), which are relevant characteristics of TNBC subtype. The purpose of this up-to-date review is to provide a detailed overview of the specific role of all four Notch receptors (Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, and Notch4) in TNBCs, thus identifying the Notch signaling pathway deregulation/activation as a pathognomonic feature of this breast cancer subtype. Furthermore, this review will also discuss recent information associated with different therapeutic options related to the four Notch receptors, which may be useful to evaluate prognostic or predictive indicators as well as to develop new therapies aimed at improving the clinical outcome of TNBC patients."

We explored the clinicopathological characteristics of Lehmann subtypes and their association with the pathologic complete response (pCR) to different treatments. The global pCR rate was 37%, and it was unevenly distributed within Lehmann’s subtypes. Basal-like 1 (BL1) tumors exhibited the highest pCR to carboplatin containing regimens (80% vs 23%, p=0.027) and were the most proliferative (Ki-67>50% of 88.2% vs. 63.7%, p=0.02). Luminal-androgen receptor (LAR) patients achieved the lowest pCR to all treatments (14.3% vs 42.7%, p=0.045 when excluding mesenchymal stem-like (MSL) samples) and were the group with the lowest proliferation (Ki-67≤50% of 71% vs 27%, p=0.002). In our cohort, only tumors with LAR phenotype presented non-basal-like intrinsic subtypes (HER2-enriched and luminal A).

It is now becoming apparent that TNBC is not one entity but constitutes a range of malignancies with different clinical behaviour. This paper reviews 7 distinct histological subtypes of TNBC where the overall prognosis is favourable, and aggressive systemic treatment is generally not indicated. Their recognition and separation from the larger group of no special type TNBC are important. The members of the European Working Group for Breast Screening Pathology review the morphology, known molecular features and reported outcomes, and formulate a consensus statement regarding the approach to the subtypes that are associated with a favourable prognosis. Abstract Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), as a group of tumours, have a worse prognosis than stage-matched non-TNBC and lack the benefits of routinely available targeted therapy. However, TNBC is a heterogeneous group of neoplasms, which includes some special type carcinomas with a relatively indolent course. This review on behalf of the European Working Group for Breast Screening Pathology reviews the literature on the special histological types of BC that are reported to have a triple negative phenotype and indolent behaviour. These include adenoid cystic carcinoma of classical type, low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma, fibromatosis-like metaplastic carcinoma, low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma, secretory carcinoma, acinic cell carcinoma, and tall cell carcinoma with reversed polarity. The pathological and known molecular features as well as clinical data including treatment and prognosis of these special TNBC subtypes are summarised and it is concluded that many patients with these rare TNBC pure subtypes are unlikely to benefit from systemic chemotherapy. A consensus statement of the working group relating to the multidisciplinary approach and treatment of these rare tumour types concludes the review."

TNBC is characterized by the absence of estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth receptor-2 (HER2) expressions and has a five-year survival rate. Compared to other breast cancer subtypes, TNBC patients only respond to conventional chemotherapies, and even then, with limited success. Shortages of chemotherapeutic medication can lead to resistance, pressured index therapy, non-selectivity, and severe adverse effects. Finding targeted treatments for TNBC is difficult owing to the various features of cancer. Hence, identifying the most effective molecular targets in TNBC pathogenesis is essential for predicting response to targeted therapies and preventing TNBC cell metastases. Nowadays, natural compounds have gained attention as TNBC treatments, and have offered new strategies for solving drug resistance. Here, we report a systematic review using the database from Pubmed, Science Direct, MDPI, BioScince, Springer, and Nature for articles screening from 2003 to 2022. This review analyzes relevant signaling pathways and the prospect of utilizing natural compounds as a therapeutic agent to improve TNBC treatments in the future."

Chemotherapy, particularly with anthracycline and taxanes, remains the backbone for medical management for both early and metastatic TNBC. More recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapy have revolutionized cancer treatment. Included in the different strategies studied for TNBC treatment is drug repurposing. Despite the numerous medications available, numerous studies in medicinal chemistry are still aimed at the synthesis of new compounds in order to find new antiproliferative agents capable of treating TNBC. Additionally, some supplemental micronutrients, nutraceuticals and functional foods can potentially reduce the risk of developing cancer or can retard the rate of growth and metastases of established malignant diseases.

There is increasing evidence of the role of tumor lymphocytic immune infiltrates in this subtype of breast cancer. Robust levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been associated with improved disease-free and overall survival rates in TNBC patients with and without any treatment. Recent efforts have been made to develop a standardized methodology for evaluating TILs. The presence of TILs in the breast tumor microenvironment can also predict responses not only to neoadjuvant but also to adjuvant chemotherapy treatments. High numbers of TILs correlate with increased pathological complete responses (pCR) in TNBC. TILs are prognostic and predictive of response to standard therapies; thus, the immune system appears to play an active role in a subgroup of breast cancer. There is an increasing interest in directly targeting the immune system as part of breast cancer therapy, mainly in patients with TNBC. New immune modulatory agents, including immune checkpoints inhibitors, have shown promising activity in a subgroup of metastatic TNBC. Increased programmed cell death protein 1 ligand (PD-L1) expression on the surface of TNBC provides the rationale for implementing therapeutic strategies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in TNBC. The programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor pembrolizumab, and the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab have shown promising results in clinical trials."

We reviewed this concept considering recent results in the field. Areas covered Herein, the authors cover neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without biologics in triple-negative and HER2-positive operable breast cancer with a focus on rates of complete pathological remission (pCR) in the breast and axilla. The impact of the CREATE X and KATERINE randomized clinical trials of post-surgical treatments in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is also discussed. Expert opinion The CREATE X and KATERINE clinical trials show for the first time and with methodological strengths that, in TNBC and HER2-positive breast cancer patients, post-surgical capecitabine and T-DM1, respectively, can improve prognosis when the disease persists after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, the role of pCR as a treatment endpoint and a guide for further treatment decisions is now demonstrated. On account of these results, neoadjuvant chemotherapy becomes not an option, but rather the preferred treatment strategy for more and more TNBC and HER2-positive breast cancer patients in clinical practice."

Combined PI3Kα and CDK4/6 inhibition significantly increased apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, and tumor immunogenicity and generated immunogenic cell death in human TNBC cell lines. Combination treatment also significantly improved disease control in human xenograft models compared with either monotherapy. Combined PI3Kα and CDK4/6 inhibition significantly increased tumor-infiltrating T-cell activation and cytotoxicity and decreased the frequency of immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells in a syngeneic TNBC mouse model.

PIK3CA is an oncogene that encodes the p110α subunit of class IA PI3K to regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis. Some reports have observed neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) to have poor pathological complete response (pCR) rates in TNBC with PIK3CA mutation. This study aimed to explore the mechanism of how mutant PIK3CA alters chemotherapeutic susceptibility in TNBC. Methods TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) with PIK3CA gene mutations (E545K and H1047R regions) and overexpression were established by transfection. NOD/SCID mice were used for in vivo experiments. Epirubicin was used as the chemotherapeutic agent. Cell viability, cell cycle, apoptosis, and Transwell assays were conducted for phenotype analysis. Western blot, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect gene and protein expression levels. A clinical analysis of 50 patients with TNBC was also performed. Results Cell viability and Transwell assays showed that PIK3CA mutation promoted TNBC cell growth and conferred an enhanced migratory phenotype. Cell cycle and apoptosis assays showed that PIK3CA mutation moderately improved the proliferation ability of TNBC cells and remarkably inhibited their apoptosis. After epirubicin therapy, the proportion of early apoptotic cells decreased among cells with PIK3CA mutation. Further, xenograft tumors grew faster in NOD/SCID mice injected with mutated cell lines than in control group, suggesting that PIK3CA mutation caused chemotherapy resistance. Importantly, western blot and immunohistochemical analysis showed that cells and mouse tumors in the PIK3CA mutation groups exhibited different expression levels of apoptosis-related markers (Xiap, Bcl-2, and Caspase 3) and proteins associated with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (p110α, AKT, p-AKT, mTOR, p-mTOR, p-4E-BP1, p-p70S6K, and Pten). Moreover, prognostic analysis of 50 patients with TNBC indicated that PIK3CA mutation might be linked with relapse and death. Conclusions PIK3CA mutation confers resistance to chemotherapy in TNBC by inhibiting apoptosis and activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway."

This review summarizes the recent advances, challenges and potential new approaches of immunotherapy in TNBC. Abstract With improved understanding of the immunogenicity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), immunotherapy has emerged as a promising candidate to treat this lethal disease owing to the lack of specific targets and effective treatments. While immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) has been effectively used in immunotherapy for several types of solid tumor, monotherapies targeting programmed death 1 (PD-1), its ligand PD-L1, or cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) have shown little efficacy for TNBC patients. Over the past few years, various therapeutic candidates have been reviewed, attempting to improve ICI efficacy on TNBC through combinatorial treatment. In this review, we describe the clinical limitations of ICI and illustrate candidates from an immunological, pharmacological, and metabolic perspective that may potentiate therapy to improve the outcomes of TNBC patients."

Median survival after BCBM diagnosis can be as short as 5 months in TNBC and 10-18 months in the other subtypes. Here, we review the biology of BCBMs and how it informs the rational design of new therapeutic approaches and agents. We discuss application of novel targeted and immunotherapies by breast cancer subtype. It is noteworthy that there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments specifically for BCBMs currently. Nevertheless, there are legitimate grounds for hope as patients with BCBMs are now being included in clinical trials of systemic therapies and a better understanding of the biology and genetic underpinning of BCBMs is driving an increased range of options for patients."

In the last decade, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to perform a pivotal role in most cellular functions. The aberrant functional expression of lncRNAs plays an ever-increasing role in the progression of diverse malignancies, including TNBC. Therefore, lncRNAs have been recently studied as predictors and modifiers of chemoresistance.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype with low survival rate and a lack of biomarkers and targeted treatments. Here, we target pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a key metabolic component of oncogenesis. In patients with TNBC, PKM2pS37 was identified as a prominent phosphoprotein corresponding to the aggressive breast cancer phenotype that showed a characteristic nuclear staining pattern and prognostic value. Phosphorylation of PKM2 at S37 was connected with a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) pathway in TNBC cells. In parallel, pyruvate kinase activator TEPP-46 bound PKM2pS37 and reduced its nuclear localization. In a TNBC mouse xenograft model, treatment with either TEPP-46 or the potent CDK inhibitor dinaciclib reduced tumor growth and diminished PKM2pS37. Combinations of dinaciclib with TEPP-46 reduced cell invasion, impaired redox balance, and triggered cancer cell death. Collectively, these data support an approach to identify PKM2pS37-positive TNBC and target the PKM2 regulatory axis as a potential treatment. Significance: PKM2 phosphorylation marks aggressive breast cancer cell phenotypes and targeting PKM2pS37 could be an effective therapeutic approach for treating triple-negative breast cancer."

The lack of an effective targeted therapy also leads to a poor prognosis for patients affected by TNBC. In the present study, we repurposed the distinctive inhibitory effects of flubendazole, a traditional anthelmintic drug, towards the putative modulation of proliferation and migration of TNBC in vitro and in vivo. Methods: According to a series of experimental approaches, including immunofluorescence (IF), immunoblotting (IB), siRNA and GFP-mRFP-LC3 plasmid transfection, respectively, we have found that flubendazole is capable of inducing autophagic cell death and apoptosis, thus exerting some anti-proliferative and anti-migration activity in TNBC cells. The therapeutic effects of flubendazole were evaluated by xenograft mouse models, followed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), IF and IB. Changes in the gene expression profiles of flubendazole-treated TNBC cells were analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and validated by IB. The potential binding mode of flubendazole and EVA1A was predicted by molecular docking and demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis. Results: We have presently found that flubendazole exhibits a considerable anti-proliferative activity in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the induction of autophagic cell death appears to be pivotal for flubendazole-mediated growth inhibition of TNBC cells, whereas blocking autophagy was able to improve the survival rate and migration ability of flubendazole-treated TNBC cells. Specifically, RNA-seq analysis showed that flubendazole treatment could promote the up-regulation of EVA1A. Flubendazole may regulate autophagy and apoptosis by targeting EVA1A, thus affecting the mechanisms of TNBC proliferation and migration. Furthermore, Thr113 may be the key amino acid residues for the binding of flubendazole to EVA1A. Conclusion: Our results provide novel insights towards the putative anti-cancer efficacy of flubendazole. Furthermore, here we show that flubendazole could serve as a potential therapeutic drug in TNBC. Altogether, this study highlights the possibility of this repurposed autophagic inducer for future cancer treatments."
New Insights into the Implication of Epigenetic Alterations in the EMT of Triple Negative Breast Cancer,"[{'authorId': '102479359', 'name': 'Noura Khaled'}, {'authorId': '4720861', 'name': 'Y.

During the last two decades, the use of targeted therapies has emerged in clinical research in order to increase treatment efficiency, improve prognosis and reduce recurrence. However, the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype remains a clinical challenge, with poor prognosis since no therapeutic targets have been identified. This aggressive breast cancer entity lacks expression of oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), and it does not overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The major reason for TNBC poor prognosis is early therapeutic escape from conventional treatments, leading to aggressive metastatic relapse. Metastases occur after an epithelial-mesenchymal transition EMT of epithelial cells, allowing them to break free from the primary tumour site and to colonize distant organs. Cancer-associated EMT consists not only of acquired migration and invasion ability, but involves complex and comprehensive reprogramming, including changes in metabolism, expression levels and epigenetic. Recently, many studies have considered epigenetic alterations as the primary initiator of cancer development and metastasis. This review builds a picture of the epigenetic modifications implicated in the EMT of breast cancer. It focuses on TNBC and allows comparisons with other subtypes. It emphasizes the role of the main epigenetic modifications lncRNAs, miRNAs, histone and DNA- modifications in tumour invasion and appearance of metastases. These epigenetic alterations can be considered biomarkers representing potential diagnostic and prognostic factors in order to define a global metastatic signature for TNBC."

Furthermore, the benefit of PARP inhibitors (PARPi) in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) remains unknown. Recent evidence indicates that in TNBCs, cells that display “cancer stem cell” properties are resistant to conventional treatments, mediate tumor metastasis, and contribute to recurrence. The sensitivity of breast cancer stem cells (CSC) to PARPi is unknown. Experimental Design: We determined the sensitivity of breast CSCs to PARP inhibition in BRCA1-mutant and -wild-type TNBC cell lines and tumor xenografts. We also investigated the role of RAD51 in mediating CSC resistance to PARPi in these in vitro and in vivo models. Results: We demonstrated that the CSCs in BRCA1-mutant TNBCs were resistant to PARP inhibition, and that these cells had both elevated RAD51 protein levels and activity. Downregulation of RAD51 by shRNA sensitized CSCs to PARP inhibition and reduced tumor growth. BRCA1–wild-type cells were relatively resistant to PARP inhibition alone, but reduction of RAD51 sensitized both CSC and bulk cells in these tumors to PARPi treatment. Conclusions: Our data suggest that in both BRCA1-mutant and BRCA1–wild-type TNBCs, CSCs are relatively resistant to PARP inhibition. This resistance is mediated by RAD51, suggesting that strategies aimed at targeting RAD51 may increase the therapeutic efficacy of PARPi. Clin Cancer Res; 23(2); 514–22. ©2016 AACR."

In this modern era of precision medicine, several new therapeutic strategies and novel agents have been investigated in the neoadjuvant setting of TNBC, in order to individualize treatment. Areas covered This review provides a comprehensive overview of the currently available evidence regarding the activity and efficacy of platinum agents, PARP- and immune-checkpoint-inhibitors for the neoadjuvant treatment of TNBC, highlighting the available data on potential predictive biomarkers of response or resistance to such treatments. Expert opinion The genomic and immune landscape of TNBC has encouraged the exploration of drugs that interfere with the DNA repair mechanism and that modulate immune response. Overall, these drugs seem to improve the pCR rate in TNBC, despite preliminary and heterogeneous results. Taking into account the economic issues and the side effects of these drugs, it is crucial to further explore the potential predictive role of BRCA mutational status and homologous recombination deficiency score, for platinum agents and PARP-inhibitors, and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and other immune biomarkers for checkpoint inhibitors, respectively."

Among the different subtypes, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by the total absence of the estrogen-receptor (ER) and progesteron-receptor (PR) expression as well as the lack of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression or gene amplification. These biological characteristics confer to TNBC a higher aggressiveness and relapse risk along with poorer prognosis compared to other subtypes. Indeed, 5-years survival rate is still low and almost all patients die, despite any adjuvant treatment which at moment represents the heading pharmacological approach. To date, several clinical trials have been designed to investigate the potential role of some molecular markers, such as VEGF, EGFR, Src and mTOR, for targeted treatments in TNBC. In fact, many inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, frequently de-regulated in TNBC, are acquiring a growing interest and several inhibitors are in preclinical development or already in early phase clinical trials. In this Review, we investigated the role of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in TNBC patients, by summarizing the molecular features that led to the distinction of different histotypes of TNBC. Furthermore, we provided an overview of the inhibition mechanisms of the mTOR and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, highlighting the importance of integrating biological and clinical data for the development of mTOR inhibitors in order to implement targeted therapies for TNBC patients."

As compared to traditional breast cancer treatments such as surgery and chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a promising approach for treating TNBC due to its precise controllability, high spatiotemporal accuracy, and minimal invasive nature. However, traditional photosensitizers used in PDT are associated with limitations of aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ), and the ACQ induced a significant decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. To address these, we synthesized a cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (cRGD) peptide-decorated conjugated polymer (CP) nanoparticles with poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV) as the photosensitizer for the theranostics of TNBC. The synthesized CP nanoparticles show bright fluorescence with high stability and could effectively produce ROS under light irradiation. Cell viability studies showed that the CP nanoparticles have negligible dark cytotoxicity and could efficiently kill the αvβ3 integrin-overexpressed MDA-MB-231 cells (one subtype of TNBC cells) in a selective way. With the use of cRGD-modified MEH-PPV nanoparticles as the theranostic agent, it permits targeted imaging and PDT of TNBC both in the in vitro 3D tumor model and in living mice. The application of CP nanoparticles in the successful theranostics of TNBC could pave the way for future development of CP-based photosensitizers for clinical applications."

We investigated whether higher peripheral lymphocyte counts are associated with lower breast cancer–specific mortality (BCM) and overall mortality (OM) in TNBC. Experimental Design: Data on treatments and diagnostic tests from electronic medical records of two health care systems were linked with demographic, clinical, pathologic, and mortality data from the California Cancer Registry. Multivariable regression models adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, cancer stage, grade, neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy use, radiotherapy use, and germline BRCA1/2 mutations were used to evaluate associations between absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), BCM, and OM. For a subgroup with TIL data available, we explored the relationship between TILs and peripheral lymphocyte counts. Results: A total of 1,463 stage I–III TNBC patients were diagnosed from 2000 to 2014; 1,113 (76%) received neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy within 1 year of diagnosis. Of 759 patients with available ALC data, 481 (63.4%) were ever lymphopenic (minimum ALC <1.0 K/μL). On multivariable analysis, higher minimum ALC, but not absolute neutrophil count, predicted lower OM [HR = 0.23; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.16–0.35] and BCM (HR = 0.19; CI, 0.11–0.34). Five-year probability of BCM was 15% for patients who were ever lymphopenic versus 4% for those who were not. An exploratory analysis (n = 70) showed a significant association between TILs and higher peripheral lymphocyte counts during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Conclusions: Higher peripheral lymphocyte counts predicted lower mortality from early-stage, potentially curable TNBC, suggesting that immune function may enhance the effectiveness of early TNBC treatment.

New targeted therapies are therefore an urgent unmet medical need for this patient population. Translational and clinical studies into new TNBC treatments have been facilitated by the increased understanding of the aberrant signal transduction pathways regulating growth and survival and the development of chemoresistance in TNBC. Some of the established targeted agents that have been approved in other indications may prove beneficial to patients with TNBC; however, in the absence of approved targeted agents for the treatment of TNBC, most new agents remain experimental. Increased understanding of molecular profiles of TNBC subtypes is likely to improve therapeutic strategies with targeted agents. Novel strategies have reached clinical evaluation in patients with TNBC, including targeting angiogenesis vascular endothelial growth factor and proliferation signalling (receptor tyrosine kinases and mammalian target of rapamycin). Aggressive TNBCs have been found to associate closely with BRCA1 mutation or dysregulation. The recent development of new investigational agents targeting DNA repair, either directly with poly(adenosine disphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitors or indirectly through DNA-binding or DNA-damage potentiation, is a major focus of current clinical studies. These and other targeted therapies represent a new approach to TNBC therapy."

Cell line models representing each of the TNBC subtypes also displayed different sensitivities to targeted therapeutic agents. Classification of TNBC into subtypes will advance further genomic research and clinical applications. Result We developed a web-based subtyping tool TNBCtype for candidate TNBC samples using our gene expression meta data and classification methods. Given a gene expression data matrix, this tool will display for each candidate sample the predicted subtype, the corresponding correlation coefficient, and the permutation P-value. We offer a user-friendly web interface to predict the subtypes for new TNBC samples that may facilitate diagnostics, biomarker selection, drug discovery, and the more tailored treatment of breast cancer."

From Models to Breast Cancer Treatments Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a particularly aggressive form, have few treatment options. Targeting either the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to Akt (PI3K-Akt) pathway or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibits tumor growth in some patients, but durable responses are rare. Modeling studies using cell lines predict that the EGFR family member HER3 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 3) may confer drug resistance. Now, Tao et al. provide evidence from patient tumors to support those predictions. Treatment with PI3K-Akt pathway inhibitors increased the abundance of both total and activated HER3 in TNBC cells in culture and TNBC xenografts in mice. Residual tumors from patients treated with EGFR inhibitors had increased abundance and activation of HER3. Combining inhibitors of the PI3K-Akt pathway with a dual inhibitor of EGFR and HER3 substantially suppressed tumor growth in mice with TNBC xenografts derived from either cell lines or patients, suggesting that this combined strategy may improve therapeutic outcome in TNBC patients. Both abundant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or ErbB1) and high activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt pathway are common and therapeutically targeted in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, activation of another EGFR family member [human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) (or ErbB3)] may limit the antitumor effects of these drugs. We found that TNBC cell lines cultured with the EGFR or HER3 ligand EGF or heregulin, respectively, and treated with either an Akt inhibitor (GDC-0068) or a PI3K inhibitor (GDC-0941) had increased abundance and phosphorylation of HER3. The phosphorylation of HER3 and EGFR in response to these treatments was reduced by the addition of a dual EGFR and HER3 inhibitor (MEHD7945A). MEHD7945A also decreased the phosphorylation (and activation) of EGFR and HER3 and the phosphorylation of downstream targets that occurred in response to the combination of EGFR ligands and PI3K-Akt pathway inhibitors. In culture, inhibition of the PI3K-Akt pathway combined with either MEHD7945A or knockdown of HER3 decreased cell proliferation compared with inhibition of the PI3K-Akt pathway alone. Combining either GDC-0068 or GDC-0941 with MEHD7945A inhibited the growth of xenografts derived from TNBC cell lines or from TNBC patient tumors, and this combination treatment was also more effective than combining either GDC-0068 or GDC-0941 with cetuximab, an EGFR-targeted antibody. After therapy with EGFR-targeted antibodies, some patients had residual tumors with increased HER3 abundance and EGFR/HER3 dimerization (an activating interaction). Thus, we propose that concomitant blockade of EGFR, HER3, and the PI3K-Akt pathway in TNBC should be investigated in the clinical setting."

Decock'}]",39,2020,ca061633ca9b660ce279c730af4180c9b831235a,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer associated with poor prognosis, early recurrence, and the lack of durable chemotherapy responses and specific targeted treatments. The recent FDA approval for immune checkpoint inhibition in combination with nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of metastatic TNBC created opportunity to advocate for immunotherapy in TNBC patients. However, improving the current low response rates is vital. Most cancers, including TNBC tumors, display metabolic plasticity and undergo reprogramming into highly glycolytic tumors through the Warburg effect. Consequently, accumulation of the metabolic byproduct lactate and extracellular acidification is often observed in several solid tumors, thereby exacerbating tumor cell proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis. In this review, we focus on the role of lactate acidosis in the microenvironment of glycolytic breast tumors as a major driver for immune evasion with a special emphasis on TNBCs. In particular, we will discuss the role of lactate regulators such as glucose transporters, lactate dehydrogenases, and lactate transporters in modulating immune functionality and checkpoint expression in numerous immune cell types. This review aims to spark discussion on interventions targeting lactate acidosis in combination with immunotherapy to provide an effective means of improving response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in TNBC, in addition to highlighting challenges that may arise from TNBC tumor heterogeneity."

Recent studies have identified metabolic alterations in cancer cells that can be targeted to improve responses to standard-of-care chemotherapy regimens. Using MDA-MB-468 and SUM-159PT TNBC cells, along with LC-MS/MS and HPLC metabolomics profiling, we found here that exposure of TNBC cells to the cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs cisplatin and doxorubicin alter arginine and polyamine metabolites. This alteration was because of a reduction in the levels and activity of a rate-limiting polyamine biosynthetic enzyme, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). Using gene silencing and inhibitor treatments, we determined that the reduction in ODC was mediated by its negative regulator antizyme, targeting ODC to the proteasome for degradation. Treatment with the ODC inhibitor difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) sensitized TNBC cells to chemotherapy, but this was not observed in receptor-positive breast cancer cells. Moreover, TNBC cell lines had greater sensitivity to single-agent DFMO, and ODC levels were elevated in TNBC patient samples. The alterations in polyamine metabolism in response to chemotherapy, as well as DFMO-induced preferential sensitization of TNBC cells to chemotherapy, reported here suggest that ODC may be a targetable metabolic vulnerability in TNBC."

Since TNBC lacks expression of ERα, PR and HER2, existing targeted treatments are not effective and the survival is poor. In this study, we demonstrate that the tumor suppressor microRNA miR-200a directly regulates the oncogene EPH receptor A2 (EPHA2) and modulates TNBC migration. We show that EPHA2 expression is correlated with poor survival specifically in basal-like breast cancer and that its expression is repressed by miR-200a through direct interaction with the 3'UTR of EPHA2. This regulation subsequently affects the downstream activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and results in decreased cell migration of TNBC. We establish that miR-200a directs cell migration in a dual manner; in addition to regulating the well-characterized E-cadherin pathway it also regulates a EPHA2 pathway. The miR-200a-EPHA2 axis is a novel mechanism highlighting the possibility of utilizing miR-200a delivery to target TNBC metastases."

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) perform multiple cytotoxic actions and are emerging as promising multifunctional agents in TNBC. Areas covered: This review focuses on the challenges so far addressed in the targeted treatment of TNBC and explores the various mechanisms by which HDACis control cancer cell growth, tumor progression and metastases. Pivotal preclinical trials on HDACis like panobinostat, vorinostat, and entinostat show that these epigenetic agents exert an anti-proliferative effect on TNBC cells and control tumor growth by multiple mechanisms of action, including apoptosis and regulation of the epithelial to mesenchimal transition (EMT). Combination studies have reported the synergism of HDACis with other anticancer agents. Expert opinion: In recent years, treatment of TNBC has recorded a high number of failures in the development of targeted agents. HDACis alone or in combination strategies show promising activity in TNBC and could have implications for the future targeted treatment of TNBC patients. Future research should identify which agent synergizes better with HDACis and which patient will benefit more from these epigenetic agents."

This is largely due to cancer plasticity and the development of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Recently, distinct yet interconvertible mesenchymal‐like and epithelial‐like states have been revealed in breast CSCs. Thus, strategies capable of simultaneously inhibiting bulk and CSC populations in both mesenchymal and epithelial states have yet to be developed. Wnt/β‐catenin and Hippo/YAP pathways are crucial in tumorigenesis, but importantly also possess tumor suppressor functions in certain contexts. One possibility is that TNBC cells in epithelial or mesenchymal state may differently affect Wnt/β‐catenin and Hippo/YAP signaling and CSC phenotypes. In this report, we found that YAP signaling and CD44high/CD24−/low CSCs were upregulated while Wnt/β‐catenin signaling and ALDH+ CSCs were downregulated in mesenchymal‐like TNBC cells, and vice versa in their epithelial‐like counterparts. Dual knockdown of YAP and Wnt/β‐catenin, but neither alone, was required for effective suppression of both CD44high/CD24−/low and ALDH+ CSC populations in mesenchymal and epithelial TNBC cells. These observations were confirmed with cultured tumor fragments prepared from patients with TNBC after treatment with Wnt inhibitor ICG‐001 and YAP inhibitor simvastatin. In addition, a clinical database showed that decreased gene expression of Wnt and YAP was positively correlated with decreased ALDH and CD44 expression in patients’ samples while increased patient survival. Furthermore, tumor growth of TNBC cells in either epithelial or mesenchymal state was retarded, and both CD44high/CD24−/low and ALDH+ CSC subpopulations were diminished in a human xenograft model after dual administration of ICG‐001 and simvastatin. Tumorigenicity was also hampered after secondary transplantation. These data suggest a new therapeutic strategy for TNBC via dual Wnt and YAP inhibition."

MicroRNAs represent an attractive candidate for targeted therapies against TNBC, due to their natural ability to act as antisense interactors and regulators of entire gene sets involved in malignancy and their superiority over mRNA profiling to accurately classify disease. Here we review the current knowledge regarding miRNAs as biomarkers in TNBC and their potential use as therapeutic targets in this disease. Further, we review other epigenetic changes and interactions of these changes with microRNAs in this breast cancer subtype, which may lead to the discovery of new treatment targets for TNBC."
A review of triple-negative breast cancer.,"[{'authorId': '1422106664', 'name': 'R. Ismail-Khan'}, {'authorId': '145882824', 'name': 'M. Bui'}]",240,2010,5a61aaf8c215e9ad921285f4c1ae37db3084ca86,"BACKGROUND
An estimated 1 million cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually worldwide. Of these, more than 170,000 are described as triple-negative. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by the lack of protein expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) and the absence of HER2 protein overexpression. TNBC is a subtype of breast cancer that overlaps with the ""basal-like"" breast cancer. TNBC has significant clinical implications.


METHODS
The epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical course, prognosis, and pathology of this subtype of breast cancer are reviewed. The authors compare the ""triple-negative"" and ""basal-like"" definitions of breast cancer. A discussion of both standard and experimental treatments for TNBC is included.


RESULTS
The poor prognosis of high-grade TNBC relates to poor disease-free interval in the adjuvant setting, shortened progression-free survival in the metastatic setting, and the lack of targeted therapy. However, not all TNBCs are associated with a poor prognosis.


CONCLUSIONS
Although chemotherapy is the main current treatment of this subtype of breast cancer, new agents such as PARP inhibitors, which show promise in the treatment of TNBC, are currently in clinical trials."

Near infrared photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT) is a cancer treatment that employs an antibody-photosensitizer conjugate (APC) followed by exposure of NIR light for activating selective cytotoxicity on targeted cancer cells and may have application to TNBC. In order to minimize the dose of APC while maximizing the therapeutic effects, dosing of the APC and NIR light need to be optimized. In this study, we investigate in vitro and in vivo efficacy of cetuximab (cet)-IR700 NIR-PIT on two breast cancer models MDAMB231 (TNBC, EGFR moderate) and MDAMB468 (TNBC, EGFR high) cell lines, and demonstrate a method to optimize the dosing APC and NIR light. Method After validating in vitro cell-specific cytotoxicity, NIR-PIT therapeutic effects were investigated in mouse models using cell lines derived from TNBC tumors. Tumor-bearing mice were separated into 4 groups for the following treatments: (1) no treatment (control); (2) 300 μg of cet-IR700 i.v., (APC i.v. only); (3) NIR light exposure only, NIR light was administered at 50 J/cm2 on day 1 and 100 J/cm2 on day 2 (NIR light only); (4) 300 μg of cet-IR700 i.v., NIR light was administered at 50 J/cm2 on day 1 after injection and 100 J/cm2 of light on day 2 after injection (one shot NIR-PIT). To compare different treatment regimens with a fixed dose of APC, we added the following treatments (5) 100 μg of cet-IR700 i.v., NIR light administered at 50 J/cm2 on day 1 and 50 μg of cet-IR700 i.v. immediately after NIR-PIT, then NIR light was administered at 100 J/cm2 on day 2, which were performed two times every week (“two split” NIR-PIT) and (6) 100 μg of cet-IR700 i.v., NIR light was administered at 50 J/cm2 on day 1 and 100 J/cm2 on day 2, which were performed three times per week (“three split” NIR-PIT). Result Both specific binding and NIR-PIT effects were greater with MDAMB468 than MDAMB231 cells in vitro. Tumor accumulation of cet-IR700 in MDAMB468 tumors was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in MDAMB231 tumors in vivo. Tumor growth and survival of MDAMB231 tumor bearing mice was significantly lower in the NIR-PIT treatment group (p < 0.05). In MDAMB468 bearing mice, tumor growth and survival was significantly improved in the NIR-PIT treatment groups in all treatment regimens (one shot NIR-PIT; p < 0.05, “two split” NIR-PIT; p < 0.01, “three split” NIR-PIT; p < 0.001) compared with control groups. Conclusion NIR-PIT for TNBC was effective regardless of expression of EGFR, however, greater cell killing was shown with higher EGFR expression tumor in vitro. In all treatment regimens, NIR-PIT suppressed tumor growth, resulting in significantly prolonged survival that further improved by splitting the APC dose and using repeated light exposures."

MATERIALS & METHODS
PLGA-PEG-NPs were synthesized by emulsion-diffusion-evaporation method, and the experiments were conducted in vitro in MDA-MB-231 and SKBr3 TNBC and normal breast fibroblast cells.


RESULTS
Delivery of orlistat via PLGA-PEG-NPs reduced its IC50 compared with free orlistat. Combined treatment of orlistat-loaded NPs and doxorubicin or antisense-miR-21-loaded NPs significantly enhanced apoptotic effect compared with independent doxorubicin, anti-miR-21-loaded NPs, orlistat-loaded NPs or free orlistat treatments.


CONCLUSION
We demonstrate that orlistat in combination with antisense-miR-21 or current chemotherapy holds great promise as a novel and versatile treatment agent for TNBC."

Huaier polysaccharide (HP), an active ingredient extracted from the mushroom Trametes robiniophila Murr, has been widely used in clinical anti-cancer treatments in China. Here we demonstrated that HP could target BCSCs in TNBC cells, resulting in decreased mammosphere formation, downregulated expression of stem-related genes and reduced proportion of aldehyde dehydrogenase positive cells in vitro, and inhibited xenograft tumor formation in vivo. Mechanically, HP markedly reduced the expression of estrogen receptor α-36 (ERα-36), a recently identified subtype of estrogen receptor α, and attenuated ERα-36-mediated activation of AKT/β-catenin signaling in ERα-36high TNBC cells.

MYC is one of the most powerful oncogenes and is known to be associated with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Its DNA amplification is often part of the targeted DNA-sequencing panels under the assumption of reflecting upregulated signaling. However, it remains unclear if MYC DNA amplification is a surrogate of its upregulated signaling. Thus, we investigated the difference between MYC DNA amplification and mRNA high expression in TNBCs utilizing publicly available cohorts. MYC DNA amplified tumors were found to have various mRNA expression levels, suggesting that MYC DNA amplification does not always result in elevated MYC mRNA expression. Compared to other subtypes, both MYC DNA amplification and mRNA high expression were more frequent in the TNBCs. MYC mRNA high expression, but not DNA amplification, was significantly associated with worse overall survival in the TNBCs. The TNBCs with MYC mRNA high expression enriched MYC target genes, cell cycle related genes, and WNT/β-catenin gene sets, whereas none of them were enriched in MYC DNA amplified TNBCs. In conclusion, MYC mRNA high expression, but not DNA amplification, reflects not only its upregulated signaling pathway, but also clinical significance in TNBCs."

Understanding the mechanisms of cancer metastasis is therefore crucial to identify new therapeutic targets and develop novel treatments to improve patient outcomes. A potential target is the TWIST1 transcription factor, which is often overexpressed in aggressive breast cancers and is a master regulator of cellular migration through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here, we demonstrate an siRNA-based TWIST1 silencing approach with delivery using a modified poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer. Our results demonstrate that SUM1315 TNBC cells efficiently take up PAMAM-siRNA complexes, leading to significant knockdown of TWIST1 and EMT-related target genes. Knockdown lasts up to one week after transfection and leads to a reduction in migration and invasion, as determined by wound healing and transwell assays. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PAMAM dendrimers can deliver siRNA to xenograft orthotopic tumors and siRNA remains in the tumor for at least four hours after treatment. These results suggest that further development of dendrimer-based delivery of siRNA for TWIST1 silencing may lead to a valuable adjunctive therapy for patients with TNBC."

Experimental Design: IHC analyses were conducted on human and PDX-TNBC samples to evaluate the production of the three biomarkers. The sensitivity of cancer cells expressing or not MT4-MMP to anti-EGFR (erlotinib) or anti-CDK4/6 inhibitor (palbociclib) was evaluated in vitro in 2D and 3D proliferation assays and in vivo using xenografts and PDX-TNBC displaying different RB, MT4-MMP, and EGFR status after single (erlotinib or palbociclib) or combined (erlotinib + palbociclib) treatments. Results: EGFR and MT4-MMP were coexpressed in >70% of TNBC samples and PDX-TNBC, among which approximately 60% maintained RB expression. Notably, approximately 50% of all TNBC and PDX-TNBC expressed the three biomarkers. Single erlotinib and palbociclib treatments drastically reduced the in vitro proliferation of cells expressing EGFR and MT4-MMP when compared with control cells. Both TNBC xenografts and PDX expressing MT4-MMP, EGFR, and RB, but not PDX-TNBC with RB loss, were sensitive to erlotinib and palbociclib with an additive effect of combination therapy. Moreover, this combination was efficient in another PDX-TNBC expressing the three biomarkers and resistant to erlotinib alone. Conclusions: We defined a new association of three biomarkers (MT4-MMP/EGFR/RB) expressed together in 50% of TNBC and demonstrated its usefulness to predict the TNBC response to anti-EGFR and anti-CDK4/6 drugs used in single or combined therapy."

We aimed to investigate whether SK4 channels affect TNBC. First, by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blotting (WB), increased SK4 protein expression in breast tumor tissues was detected relative to that in non-tumor breast tissues, but there was no apparent expression difference between various subtypes of breast cancer (p>0.05). Next, functional SK4 channels were detected in the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 using WB, real-time PCR, immunofluorescence and patch-clamp recording. By employing SK4 specific siRNAs and blockers, including TRAM-34 and clotrimazole, in combination with an MTT assay, a colony-formation assay, flow cytometry and a cell motility assay, we found that the suppression of SK4 channels significantly inhibited cell proliferation and migration and promoted apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells (p<0.05). Further investigation revealed that treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF)/basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) caused MDA-MB-231 cells to undergo the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and to show increased SK4 mRNA expression. In addition, the down-regulation of SK4 expression inhibited the EMT markers Vimentin and Snail1. Collectively, our findings suggest that SK4 channels are expressed in TNBC and are involved in the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and EMT processes of TNBC cells."

However, the feature of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) frequently overexpressed in TNBC offers the opportunity to employ lapatinib, a dual-tyrosine kinase inhibitor of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) and EGFR, in the treatment of brain metastasis of TNBC. Unfortunately, the low oral bioavailability of lapatinib and drug efflux by blood-brain barrier have resulted in low drug delivery efficiency into the brain and limited therapeutic effects for patients with brain metastasis in clinical trials. To overcome such disadvantages, we developed lapatinib-loaded human serum albumin (HSA) nanoparticles, named LHNPs, by modified nanoparticle albumin-bound (Nab) technology. LHNPs had a core-shell structure and the new HSA/phosphatidylcholine sheath made LHNPs stable in bloodstream. Compared to free lapatinib, LHNPs could inhibit the adhesion, migration and invasion ability of high brain-metastatic 4T1 cells more effectively in vitro. Tissue distribution following intravenous administration revealed that LHNPs (i.v., 10 mg/kg) achieved increased delivery to the metastatic brain at 5.43 and 4.36 times the levels of Tykerb (p.o., 100 mg/kg) and lapatinib solution (LS, i.v., 10 mg/kg), respectively. Compared to the marketed Tykerb group, LHNPs had markedly better inhibition effects on brain micrometastasis and significantly extended the median survival time of 4T1 brain metastatic mice in consequence. The improved anti-tumor efficacy of LHNPs could be partly ascribed to down-regulating metastasis-related proteins. Therefore, these results clearly indicated that LHNPs could become a promising candidate for clinical applications against brain metastasis of TNBC."

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by a lack of expression of both estrogen (ER) and progesteron (PgR) receptors as well as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Our retrospective analysis addressed prognostic factors for short- and long-term outcomes of patients (pts) with TNBC pts treated in routine clinical practice. Patient and methods. Our retrospective study included 269 TNBC treated at Institute of Oncology Ljubljana between March 2000 and December 2006. The collected data included patients', tumours' and treatments' characteristics. The survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazard model was used in the multivariate analysis. Results. The median age of our patients was 55.3 yrs (23-88.5) and the median follow-up was 5.9 yrs (0.3-9.6). Six (2%) pts experienced local only, 79 (92%) pts distal recurrence and 66 (24%) died. The predominant localisation of the first relapse was in visceral organs (70.4%). The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) for the entire group was 68.2% and the 5-year overall survival (OS) was 74.5%. We found a pattern of high recurrence rate in the first 3 years following the diagnosis and a clear decline in recurrence rate over the next 3 years. In the univariate analysis age, nodal status, size and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were found to have a significant impact on DFS as well as on OS. In the multivariate analysis only age (HR=1.79; 95%CI=1.14-2.82; p=0.012) and nodal status (HR=2.71; 95%CI=1.64-4.46; p<0.001) retained their independent prognostic value for DFS and for OS only the nodal status (HR=2.96; 95%CI=1.51-5.82; p=0.002). Conclusions. In our series of TNBC pts nodal status and age (older than 65 yrs) were found to be independent prognostic factors for DFS, whereas for OS only the nodal status. We found a pattern of a high recurrence rate in the first 3 years following the diagnosis and a decline in the recurrence rate over the next 3 yrs with higher rate of distal versus local recurrence and a predominant localization of distal metastases in visceral organs."

TNBC accounts for approximately 12 to 20 percent of all breast cancer cases. The absence of ER, PR, and HER2 receptors on TNBCs and its ability to develop drug resistance renders it difficult to eradicate or retrogress tumor growth with hormonal therapy and chemotherapy. Triple-negative breast cancer is associated with poorer prognosis, increased chance of relapse, and lower chance of survival. Patients with TNBC have poorer outcome to conventional treatments than patients with other types of breast cancer. Natural killer cell-mediated immunotherapy is a promising therapeutic option for patients with TNBC. Natural killer cells contribute to the immune system by recognizing tumor cells through interactions between ligands on tumor cells and natural killer cell receptors. NK cell function is regulated by a net balance of signals from activating and inhibitory receptors interacting with ligands on target cells. Lectin-like Transcript-1 (LLT1, CLEC2D, OCIL) is a ligand that interacts with NK cell receptor NKRP1A (CD161) and inhibits NK cell activation. In this study, we have identified expression of LLT1 on TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 through flow cytometry, western blot, and confocal microscopy. We have demonstrated that blocking LLT1 on TNBCs with antibodies disrupts interaction with NKRP1A and enhances lysis of TNBCs by primary natural killer cells. We have also shown that a gene knockdown of LLT1 decreases cell surface expression of LLT1 on TNBCs and increases NK cell-mediated lysis of these TNBCs. The results suggest that LLT1 on TNBCs function as a method of evasion from immunosurveillance by NK cells. Blocking LLT1-NKRP1A interaction activates lysis by NK cells and will potentially open a new immunotherapeutic strategy for treatment of TNBC."

We developed patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from residual tumors to identify efficient chemotherapies and predictive biomarkers in a context of resistance to anthracyclines- and taxanes-based treatments. Experimental Design: PDX were established from residual tumors of primary breast cancer patients treated in neoadjuvant setting. TNBC PDX were treated by anthracyclines, taxanes, platins, and capecitabine. Predictive biomarkers were identified by transcriptomic and immunohistologic analysis. Downregulation of RB1 was performed by siRNA in a cell line established from a PDX. Results: Residual TNBC PDX were characterized by a high tumor take, a short latency, and a poor prognosis of the corresponding patients. With the exception of BRCA1/2-mutated models, residual PDX were resistant to anthracyclines, taxanes, and platins. Capecitabine, the oral prodrug of 5-FU, was highly efficient in 60% of PDX, with two models showing complete responses. Prior treatment of a responder PDX with 5-FU increased expression of thymidylate synthase and decreased efficacy of capecitabine. Transcriptomic and IHC analyses of 32 TNBC PDX, including both residual tumors and treatment-naïve derived tumors, identified RB1 and TYMP proteins as predictive biomarkers for capecitabine response. Finally, RB1 knockdown in a cell line established from a capecitabine-responder PDX decreased sensitivity to 5-FU treatment. Conclusions: We identified capecitabine as efficient chemotherapy in TNBC PDX models established from residual disease and resistant to anthracyclines, taxanes, and platins. RB1 positivity and high expression of TYMP were significantly associated with capecitabine response. Clin Cancer Res; 24(11); 2605–15. ©2018 AACR."

Conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy are effective treatments for patients with TNBC. However, the prognosis of TNBC remains unsatisfactory. Therefore, a large volume of research has explored the molecular markers and oncogenic signaling pathways associated with TNBC, including the cell cycle, DNA damage response and androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathways, to identify more efficient targeted therapies. However, whether these predicted pathways are effective targets has yet to be confirmed. In the present review, potentially carcinogenic signaling pathways in TNBCs from previous reports were considered, and ultimately five tumorigenic signaling pathways were selected, specifically receptor tyrosine kinases and downstream signaling pathways, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and associated pathways, the immunoregulatory tumor microenvironment, DNA damage repair pathways, and AR and coordinating pathways. The conclusions of the preclinical and clinical trials of each pathway were then consolidated. Although a number of signaling pathways in TNBC have been considered in preclinical and clinical trials, the aforementioned pathways account for the majority of the malignant behaviors of TNBC. Identifying the alterations to different carcinogenic signaling pathways and their association with the heterogeneity of TNBC may facilitate the development of optimal precision medical approaches for patients with TNBC, potentially improving the efficiency of anticancer therapy."

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is most the aggressive type of breast cancer and is poorly responsive to endocrine therapeutics; however, one of the most attractive treatments is tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-based therapies. To identify compounds that enhance the efficacy of TRAIL-based therapies, we screened 55 compounds from natural products in combination with TRAIL in TNBC cells.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human TNBC cells, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231, and murine TNBC cells, 4T1, were used. Cell viability, apoptotic cells, and cell cycle were quantified by the WST-1 assay, annexin-V/7-amino-actinomycinD (7-AAD) staining and Propidium iodide (PI) staining, respectively. In vivo effects of piperine were evaluated in the orthotopic-inoculated 4T1-luc mouse model.


RESULTS
After screening, we identified piperine as the most potent adjuvant at enhancing the efficacy of TRAIL-based therapies in TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo, which might be mediated through inhibition of survivin and p65 phosphorylation.

Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) do not represent a single disease subgroup and are often aggressive breast cancers with poor prognoses. Unlike estrogen/progesterone receptor and HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) breast cancers, which are responsive to targeted treatments, there is no effective targeted therapy for TNBC, although approximately 50% of patients respond to conventional chemotherapies, including taxanes, anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, and platinum salts.


CONTENT
Genomic studies have helped clarify some of the possible disease groupings that make up TNBC. We discuss the findings, including copy number-transcriptome analysis, whole genome sequencing, and exome sequencing, in terms of the biological properties and phenotypes that make up the constellation of TNBC. The relationships between subgroups defined by transcriptome and genome analysis are discussed.


SUMMARY
TNBC is not a uniform molecular or disease entity but a constellation of variably well-defined biological properties whose relationship to each other is not understood. There is good support for the existence of a basal expression subtype, p53 mutated, high-genomic instability subtype of TNBC. This should be considered a distinct TNBC subtype. Other subtypes with variable degrees of supporting evidence exist within the nonbasal/p53wt (wild-type p53) TNBC, including a group of TNBC with PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) pathway activation that have better overall prognosis than the basal TNBC. Consistent molecular phenotyping of TNBC by whole genome sequencing, transcriptomics, and functional studies with patient-derived tumor xenograft models will be essential components in clinical and biological studies as means of resolving this heterogeneity."

Due to the loss of expression of receptors, treatment options for TNBC are limited. Therefore, finding safe and effective treatments for patients with TNBC is a major objective for clinicians. Previous studies suggested that cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells may be beneficial for patients with a variety of tumor types. However, CIK therapy is not effective for all patients. In this study, we found that focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that regulates several cellular functions in different cells, has the potential to regulate tumor cells sensitized to CIK cells. Knockdown of FAK expression in TNBC cells or the treatment of TNBC cells with a FAK inhibitor followed by coculture with CIK cells increases death of TNBC cells, suggesting that FAK plays important roles in sensitizing tumor cells to CIK cells. This phenomenon could be regulated by a FAK-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-related mechanism.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive disease, nevertheless exhibiting a high response rate to chemotherapy. Since the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) loss confers a high sensitivity to chemotherapy regimens, we evaluated the prevalence of pRb loss in TNBCs and its relevance on the clinical outcome of patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
pRb status was prospectively evaluated by immunocytochemistry in 518 consecutive patients with complete receptor information. The predictive value of pRb status in TNBCs was determined according to the adjuvant therapeutic treatments.


RESULTS
Fifty-three tumors were identified as TNBCs. The prevalence of pRb loss was significantly higher in TNBCs than in the other cancer subtypes. All patients with TNBCs lacking pRb and treated with systemic chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil) were disease free at a medium follow-up time of 109 months, whereas the clinical outcome of those expressing pRb was significantly poorer (P = 0.008). Analysis of disease-free survival including the established anatomo-clinical prognostic parameters indicated pRb loss as the only significant predictive factor.


CONCLUSIONS
pRb loss is much more frequent in TNBCs than in the other breast cancer subtypes. Patients with TNBCs lacking pRb had a very favorable clinical outcome if treated with conventional adjuvant chemotherapy."

Many patients with TNBC relapse quickly and commonly develop metastases. There are no individualized targeted adjuvant or induction treatments for TNBC, and the current treatments are highly toxic. Development of chemoprevention methods using natural products would be beneficial to patients at risk of TNBC. To investigate the inhibitory effect of blueberries on inflammation-induced TNBC and identify the mechanism underlying modulation of inflammatory proteins by blueberries, we induced a proinflammatory microenvironment by feeding female MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice a high fat western diet (W) with 5% whole blueberry powder (BB) and studied the effect on tumor formation and metastasis. We showed that mice fed a BB diet had significantly smaller tumors, less ulceration, and significantly less metastasis to the inguinal lymph nodes than mice fed a W diet. In BB-fed mice, serum levels of specific antiinflammatory cytokines were increased and specific cytokine expression was also altered. Together, these results suggest that blueberries may inhibit TNBC and TNBC-related metastasis by reducing inflammation via specific cytokine-driven pathways and thus reduce tumor growth and metastasis."

All-in-one covalent nanodrugs of the third generation have been synthesized based on a poly(β-l-malic acid) (PMLA) platform, targeting human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). They significantly inhibited tumor growth in nude mice by blocking synthesis of epidermal growth factor receptor, and α4 and β1 chains of laminin-411, the tumor vascular wall protein and angiogenesis marker.

TNBC disproportionately affects younger women and women of colour, and new treatments are needed. The opioid growth factor (OGF) – opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr) axis is a determinant of cell proliferation in neoplasia, and OGF is an endogenously produced pentapeptide that inhibits cell replication by interacting with OGFr and upregulating cyclin-dependent inhibitory kinase pathways thus reducing DNA synthesis. In these studies we investigated the presence and function of the OGF-OGFr axis in two human TNBC cell lines, as well as in breast cancer cell lines containing hormonal receptors. TNBC cell lines MDA-MD-231 and BT-20, as well as human breast cancer cells SK-BR-3 and MCF-7, were examined for the presence of pentapeptide and receptors, as well as their response to OGF. Specificity of peptide and receptor was confirmed by antibody neutralization and molecular studies to knockdown classical receptor protein. The requirement for protein transcription and translation and RNA transcription were investigated. Growth of TNBC cells in the presence of OGF and standard of care chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel was evaluated to determine both efficacy and protective effects against toxicity. OGF treatment inhibited TNBC cells in a dosage related, receptor mediated, and reversible manner. OGF was the specific endogenous opioid to inhibit cell proliferation, and this was mediated by p21 cyclin dependent inhibitory kinase pathways, and required protein and RNA synthesis. OGFr was the specific receptor involved; both peptide and receptor were detected in all four cell lines. OGF treatment inhibited growth of all cancer cell lines evaluated, and reduced cell death in cultures exposed to paclitaxel. The OGF-OGFr axis is present and functioning in TNBC cell lines, and provides a novel biological pathway as potential therapy."

It is a heterogeneous group of tumors with diverse histology, molecular uniqueness and response to treatment. Unfortunately, TNBC patients do not benefit from current anti-HER2 or hormone positive targeted breast cancer treatments; consequently, these patients rely primarily on chemotherapy. However, the 5-year survival rate for woman with metastatic TNBC is less than 30%. As a result of ineffective treatments, TNBC tumors often progress to metastatic lesions in the brain and lung. Brain metastases of invasive breast cancer are associated with 1 and 2 year survival rate of 20% and <2% respectively. Because the only current systemic treatment for TNBC is chemotherapy, alternative targeted therapies are urgently needed to improve the prognosis for TNBC patients. This review is focused on opportunities for developing new approaches for filling the current void in an effective treatment for TNBC patients."

Drugs inhibiting tyrosine kinases, such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and KIT, have shown some promising results for patients with TNBC. The aim of the study was to investigate whether gains and/or amplifications of VEGFR2 and KIT, located at 4q12, occur in TNBC. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to quantify gene copy numbers of VEGFR2 and KIT in 83 primary human breast cancers including 31 TNBCs. Gains were defined as ≥4 gene copies in >40% of the cancer cells, whereas amplification was defined as CEP >2 in more than 10% of the cancer cells. A tumor was considered FISH positive for KIT and/or VEGFR2 if it displayed copy number gain and/or amplification. Ten (32%) of the TNBCs were VEGFR2 FISH positive and nine (29%) were KIT FISH positive, whereas non‐TNBCs were FISH positive for VEGFR2 and KIT in nine (18%) cases for both genes, but no significant difference between TNBCs and non‐TNBCs was found. FISH positivity for VEGFR2 and KIT was significantly correlated (χ2 test, P < 0.001), and significantly related to ER negativity and high Nottingham histological grade (NHG). A significantly worse 5‐year breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) was seen for FISH positive cases. Increased copy number of VEGFR2 and KIT thus has the potential of functioning as a novel predictive biomarker for selected targeted therapy particularly in the difficult‐to‐treat TNBC patient category. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Combination of anti-angiogenesis and immunotherapy holds promise for effective inhibition of tumor proliferation and invasion, while it remains challenging for specific targeting drug delivery to tumors and metastatic lesions. Here, a multifunctional biomimetic liposome loading Gambogic acid (G/R-MLP) was developed using Ginsenoside Rg3 (Rg3) to substitute cholesterol and cancer cell membrane coating, which was designed to increase long-circulating action by a low immunogenicity and specifically deliver Gambogic acid (GA) to tumor site and metastatic lesions by homologous targeting and glucose transporter (GLUT) targeting. After G/R-MLP accumulated in the primary tumors and metastatic nodules, it synergistically enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of GA, effectively suppressing the tumor growth and lung metastasis by killing tumor cells, inhibiting tumor cell migration and invasion, achieving anti-angiogenesis and improving the anti-tumor immunity. All in all, the strategy combining chemotherapy, anti-angiogenesis and immunotherapy improved therapeutic efficiency and prolonged survival, providing a new perspective for the clinical treatment of TNBC.

Based on CTNeoBC pooled analysis data, the achievement of pathologic CR (pCR) in TNBC is directly linked to improved survival outcomes. Therefore, the treatment paradigm for early TNBC has shifted to neoadjuvant treatment, and the escalation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to improve the pCR rate and the addition of post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy to control the residual disease have been investigated.

Nanotechnology‐assisted photothermal therapy (PTT) opens new opportunities for precise cancer treatment. However, thermoresistance caused by PTT, as well as uncertainty in the physiological metabolism of existing phototherapeutic nanoformulations, severely limit their clinical applications. Herein, based on the clinically chemotherapeutic drug mitoxantrone (MTO), a multifunctional nanoplatform (MTO‐micelles) is developed to realize mutually synergistic mild‐photothermal chemotherapy. MTO with excellent near‐infrared absorption (≈669 nm) can function not only as a chemotherapeutic agent but also as a photothermal transduction agent with elevated photothermal conversion efficacy (ƞ = 54.62%). MTO‐micelles can accumulate at the tumor site through the enhanced permeability and retention effect. Following local near‐infrared irradiation, mild hyperthermia (<50 °C) assists MTO in binding tumor cell DNA, resulting in chemotherapeutic sensitization. In addition, downregulation of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) expression due to enhanced DNA damage can in turn weaken tumor thermoresistance, boosting the efficacy of mild PTT. Both in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that MTO‐micelles possess excellent synergetic tumor inhibition effects. Therefore, the mild‐photothermal chemotherapy strategy based on MTO‐micelles has a promising prospect in the clinical transformation of TNBC treatment."

This study is the first to identify a novel circular RNA (circRNA), circTBC1D14, whose expression is significantly upregulated in TNBC. The authors confirm that high circTBC1D14 expression is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. circTBC1D14‐associated mass spectrometry and RNA‐binding protein‐related bioinformatics strategies indicate that FUS can interact with circTBC1D14, which can bind to the downstream flanking sequence of circTBC1D14 to induce cyclization. FUS is an essential biomarker associated with stress granules (SGs), and the authors find that hypoxic conditions can induce FUS–circTBC1D14‐associated SG formation in the cytoplasm after modification by protein PRMT1. Subsequently, circTBC1D14 increases the stability of PRMT1 by inhibiting its K48‐regulated polyubiquitination, leading to the upregulation of PRMT1 expression. In addition, FUS–circTBC1D14 SGs can initiate a cascade of SG‐linked proteins to recognize and control the elimination of SGs by recruiting LAMP1 and enhancing lysosome‐associated autophagy flux, thus contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and promoting tumor progression in TNBC. Overall, these findings reveal that circTBC1D14 is a potential prognostic indicator that can serve as a therapeutic target for TNBC treatment."

Historically, capecitabine has been the cornerstone of adjuvant therapy for TNBC patients not achieving a pathological complete response (pCR). However, the integration of new modalities such as immunotherapy and PARP inhibitors has prompted a re-evaluation of traditional post-neoadjuvant approaches. Methods: This review synthesizes data from pivotal clinical trials and meta-analyses to evaluate the efficacy of emerging therapies in the post-neoadjuvant setting. We focus on the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), PARP inhibitors (PARPis), and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) alongside or in place of capecitabine in TNBC treatment paradigms. Results: The addition of ICIs like pembrolizumab to neoadjuvant regimens has shown increased pCR rates and improved event-free survival, posing new questions about optimal post-neoadjuvant therapies. Similarly, PARPis have demonstrated efficacy in BRCA-mutated TNBC populations, with significant improvements in disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Emerging studies on ADCs further complicate the adjuvant landscape, offering potentially efficacious alternatives to capecitabine, especially in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy. Discussion: The challenge remains to integrate these new treatments into clinical practice effectively, considering factors such as drug resistance, patient-specific characteristics, and socio-economic barriers. This review discusses the implications of these therapies and suggests a future direction focused on personalized medicine approaches in TNBC. Conclusions: As the treatment landscape for TNBC evolves, the role of capecitabine is being critically examined. While it remains a viable option for certain patient groups, the introduction of ICIs, PARPis, and ADCs offers promising alternatives that could redefine adjuvant therapy standards. Ongoing and future trials will be pivotal in determining the optimal therapeutic strategies for TNBC patients with residual disease post-neoadjuvant therapy."

Taxane and anthracycline-containing chemotherapy (CT) is currently the main systemic treatment option for TNBC, while platinum-based chemotherapy showed promising results in the neoadjuvant and metastatic settings. An early arising of intrinsic or acquired CT resistance is common and represents the main hurdle for successful TNBC treatment. Numerous mechanisms were uncovered that can lead to the development of chemoresistance. These include cancer stem cells (CSCs) induction after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, hypoxia and avoidance of apoptosis, single factors such as tyrosine kinase receptors (EGFR, IGFR1), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10), and a few pathological molecular pathways. Some biomarkers capable of predicting resistance to specific chemotherapeutic agents were identified and are expected to be validated in future studies for a more accurate selection of drugs to be employed and for a more tailored approach, both in neoadjuvant and advanced settings. Recently, based on specific biomarkers, some therapies were tailored to TNBC subsets and became available in clinical practice: olaparib and talazoparib for BRCA1/2 germline mutation carriers larotrectinib and entrectinib for neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusion carriers, and anti-trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (Trop2) antibody drug conjugate therapy for heavily pretreated metastatic TNBC (mTNBC). Further therapies targeting some pathologic molecular pathways, apoptosis, miRNAS, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), and androgen receptor (AR) are under investigation. Among them, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and EGFR inhibitors as well as antiandrogens showed promising results and are under evaluation in Phase II/III clinical trials. Emerging therapies allow to select specific antiblastics that alone or by integrating the conventional therapeutic approach may overcome/hinder chemoresistance."

Recently, various types of nanoparticles have emerged as a therapeutic option against TNBC, to elevate the therapeutic efficacy of the existing chemotherapeutics. Among the various nanoparticles, lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) viz. liposomes, nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid nanocarriers, and lipid–polymer hybrid nanoparticles are developed for cancer treatment which is well confirmed and documented. LNPs include various therapeutic advantages as compared to conventional therapy and other nanoparticles, including increased loading capacity, enhanced temporal and thermal stability, decreased therapeutic dose and associated toxicity, and limited drug resistance. In addition to these, LNPs overcome physiological barriers which provide increased accumulation of therapeutics at the target site. Extensive efforts by the scientific community could make some of the liposomal formulations the clinical reality; however, the relatively high cost, problems in scaling up the formulations, and delivery in a more targetable fashion are some of the major issues that need to be addressed. In the present review, we have compiled the state of the art about different types of LNPs with the latest advances reported for the treatment of TNBC in recent years, along with their clinical status and toxicity in detail."

Conventional chemotherapy remains the only treatment regimen against TNBC and suffers several limitations such as low bioavailability, systemic toxicity, less targetability, and multi-drug resistance. Although various targeted therapies have been introduced to manage the hardship of TNBC, they still experience certain limitations associated with the survival benefits. The current research thus aimed at developing and improving the strategies for effective therapy against TNBC. Such strategies involved the emergence of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles are designated as nanocavalries, loaded with various agents (drugs, genes, etc.) to battle the progression and metastasis of TNBC along with overcoming the limitations experienced by conventional chemotherapy and targeted therapy. This article documents the treatment regimens of TNBC along with their efficacy towards different subtypes of TNBC, and the various nanotechnologies employed to increase the therapeutic outcome of FDA-approved drug regimens."

It has a limited therapeutic index owing to its extreme toxicity and the emergence of drug resistance. As a result, there is a pressing need to find innovative drugs that enhance the effectiveness of doxorubicin while minimizing its toxicity. The rationale of the present study is that combining emerging treatment agents or repurposed pharmaceuticals with doxorubicin might increase susceptibility to therapeutics and the subsequent establishment of improved pharmacological combinations for treating triple-negative breast cancer. Additionally, combined treatment will facilitate dosage reduction, reducing the toxicity associated with doxorubicin. Recently, the third-generation retinoid adapalene was reported as an effective anticancer agent in several malignancies. This study aimed to determine the anticancer activity of adapalene in TNBC cells and its effectiveness in combination with doxorubicin, and the mechanistic pathways in inhibiting tumorigenicity. Adapalene inhibits tumor cell growth and proliferation and acts synergistically with doxorubicin in inhibiting growth, colony formation, and migration of TNBC cells. Also, the combination of adapalene and doxorubicin enhanced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species triggering hyperphosphorylation of Erk1/2 and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that adapalene is a promising antitumor agent that may be used as a single agent or combined with present therapeutic regimens for TNBC treatment."

A large number of novel therapeutic agents are being evaluated for their efficacy in TNBC. As novel therapeutics are now incorporated into clinical practice, it is clear that tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution can result to de novo or acquired treatment resistance. As precision medicine and next generation sequencing is part of cancer diagnostics, tailored treatment approaches based on the expression of molecular markers are currently being implemented in clinical practice and clinical trial design.

However, most of these cancers are unresponsive, and there is a requirement for more effective treatment modalities. Further, there is a lack of effective biomarkers that can distinguish TNBC from other BC subtypes. ER, PR, and HER2 help identify TNBC and are widely used to identify patients who are most likely to respond to diverse therapeutic strategies. In this review, we discuss the possible treatment options for TNBC based on its inherent subtype receptors and pathways, such as p53 signaling, AKT signaling, cell cycle regulation, DNA damage, and programmed cell death, which play essential roles at multiple stages of TNBC development. We focus on poly-ADP ribose polymerase 1, androgen receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, and epidermal growth factor receptor as well as the application of nanomedicine and immunotherapy in TNBC and discuss their potential applications in drug development for TNBC."

The role played by the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and its cognate receptor IGF-1R in TNBC has been reported. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms by which the IGF-1/IGF-1R system may contribute to TNBC progression still remains to be fully understood. By computational analysis of the vast cancer genomics information in public databases (TCGA and METABRIC), we obtained evidence that high IGF-1 or IGF-1R levels correlate with a worse clinical outcome in TNBC patients. Further bioinformatics analysis revealed that both the focal adhesion and the Hippo pathways are enriched in TNBC harboring an elevated expression of IGF-1 or IGF-1R. Mechanistically, we found that in TNBC cells, the IGF-1/IGF-1R system promotes the activation of the FAK signal transduction pathway, which in turn regulates the nuclear accumulation of YAP (yes-associated protein/yes-related protein) and the expression of its target genes. At the biological level, we found that the IGF-1/IGF-1R-FAK-YAP network cascade triggers the growth potential of TNBC cells, as evaluated in different experimental systems. Overall, our results suggest that the IGF-1/IGF-1R/FAK/YAP axis may contribute to the progression of the aggressive TNBC subtype."

Furthermore, we have also investigated the HuR therapeutic relevance in TNBCs, which is an aggressive breast cancer subtype. Using an online meta-analysis tool, we found that HuR protein overexpression positively correlates with reduced overall survival of TNBC patients (p = 0.028). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the TNBC breast cancer cell lines i.e., MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 are good model systems to study HuR protein, as they both exhibit a significant amount of cytoplasmic HuR (active form). Quercetin treatment significantly inhibited the cytoplasmic HuR in both TNBC cell lines. By using specific HuR siRNA, we established that quercetin-mediated inhibition of adhesion and migration of TNBC cells is dependent on HuR. Upon analyzing adhesion proteins i.e., β-catenin and CD44, we found that quercetin mediated effect on TNBC adhesion and migration was through the HuR-β-catenin axis and CD44, independently. Overall, the present results demonstrate that elevated HuR levels are associated with TNBC progression and relapse, and the ability of quercetin to inhibit cytoplasmic HuR protein provides a rationale for using it as an anticancer agent for the treatment of aggressive TNBCs.

TNBC (Triple-negative breast cancer) has limited treatment options and still lacks viable molecular targets, leading to poor outcomes. Recently, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have been shown to play crucial roles in human cancers, including BC, by modulating a number of oncogenic phenotypes. This suggests that RBPs represent potential molecular targets for BC therapy. Methods: We employed genomic data to identify RBPs specifically expressed in TNBC. NONO was silenced in TNBC cell lines to examine cell growth, colony formation, invasion, and migration. Gene expression profiles in NONO-silenced cells were generated and analyzed. A high-throughput screening for NONO-targeted drugs was performed using an FDA-approved library. Results: We found that the NONO RBP is highly expressed in TNBC and is associated with poor patient outcomes. NONO binds to STAT3 mRNA, increasing STAT3 mRNA levels in TNBC. Surprisingly, NONO directly interacts with STAT3 protein increasing its stability and transcriptional activity, thus contributing to its oncogenic function. Importantly, high-throughput drug screening revealed that auranofin is a potential NONO inhibitor and inhibits cell growth in TNBC. Conclusions: NONO is an RBP upstream regulator of both STAT3 RNA and protein levels and function. It represents an important and clinically relevant promoter of growth and resistance of TNBCs. NONO is also therefore a potential therapeutic target in TNBC."

Experimental discovery of molecular signatures including the ‘BRCAness’ highlighted the innate heterogeneity of TNBC, generating the diversity of TNBC phenotypes. As it contributes to enhancing genomic instability, it has widened the therapeutic spectrum of TNBC. In particular, unusual sensitivity to DNA damaging agents was denoted in patients with BRCA deficiency, suggesting therapeutic benefit from platinum and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors. However, regardless of enriched chemosensitivity and immunogenicity, majority of patients with TNBC still suffer from dismal clinical outcomes including early relapse and metastatic spread. Therefore, efforts into more precise and personalised treatment are critical at this point. Accordingly, the advance of multiomics has revealed novel actionable targets including PI3K-Akt-mTOR and epidermal growth factor receptor signalling pathways, which might actively participate in modulating the chemosensitivity and immune system. Also, TNBC has long been considered a potential protagonist of immunotherapy in breast cancer, supported by abundant tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and heterogeneous tumour microenvironment. Despite that, earlier studies showed somewhat unsatisfactory results of monotherapy with immune-checkpoint inhibitors, consistently durable responses in responders were noteworthy. Based on these results, further combinatorial trials either with other chemotherapy or targeted agents are underway. Incorporating immune-molecular targets into combination as well as refining the standard chemotherapy might be the key to unlock the future of TNBC. In this review, we share the current and upcoming treatment options of TNBC in the framework of scientific and clinical data, especially focusing on early stage of TNBC."

Nuclear localized class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) enzymes, particularly HDACs 1, 2, 3 deacetylate chromatin histones, are overexpressed in cancers and epigenetically regulate the expression of genes involved in cancer initiation and progression. The specific HDAC inhibitor, entinostat, has been shown to attenuate tumor progression and metastasis in TNBC. In this study, we hypothesized that entinostat would enhance the expression of anti-angiogenic and tumor suppressor genes and would thus suppress VM structures in TNBC cells in a 3D Matrigel cell culture preclinical model. Our data indicated that invasive triple-negative MDA-MB-231, LM2-4 and BT-549 breast cancer cells, but not poorly invasive luminal MCF-7 cells, efficiently underwent matrix-associated VM formation. Approximately 80% of TNBC cells with the stem cell phenotype potential formed vessel-like structures when mixed with Matrigel and cultured in the low attachment tissue culture plate. The molecular mechanisms of VM formation are rather complex, while angiogenesis inhibitor genes are downregulated and pro-angiogenesis genes are upregulated in VM-forming cells. Our data revealed that treatment of the TNBC VM phenotype cells with entinostat epigenetically led to the re-expression of the anti-angiogenic genes, serpin family F member 1 (SERPINF1) and thrombospondin 2 (THBS2), and to that of the tumor suppressor genes, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and p21, and reduced VM structures. We also found that treatment of the TNBC VM phenotype cells with entinostat downregulated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), and that of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes, Vimentin and β-catenin. METABIRC and TCGA breast cancer cohort mRNA expression data analysis revealed that a high expression of the anti-angiogenesis-associated genes, THBS2, SERPINF1 and serpin family B member 5 (SERPINB5), and of the tumor suppressor gene, PTEN, was associated with a better overall survival (OS) of breast cancer patients. Taken together, the findings of this study demonstrate that HDACs 1, 2, 3 partly contribute to VM formation in TNBC cells; thus, HDACs may be an important therapeutic target for TNBC."

High rates of metastasis, poor prognosis, and drug resistance are the major problems associated with TNBC. The current chemotherapeutics eliminate only the bulk tumor cells (non-BCSCs) and do not affect breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). The BCSCs which are left behind after chemotherapy is reported to promote recurrence and metastasis of TNBC. Death receptor-5 (DR-5) is exclusively expressed in TNBCs and mediates the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. DR-5, therefore, can be exploited for targeted drug delivery and to induce apoptosis. Gamma-secretase mediated Notch signaling in BCSCs regulates its proliferation, differentiation, and metastasis. The endogenous ligand, Delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4), is reported to activate this Notch signaling in TNBC. Blocking this signaling pathway using both gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) and DLL4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) may produce synergistic benefits. Further, the GSIs (DAPT, LY-411575, RO4929097, MK0752, etc.) suffer from poor bioavailability and off-target side effects such as diarrhea, suppression of lymphopoiesis, headache, hypertension, fatigue, and ventricular dysfunctions. In this hypothesis, we discuss Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) based drug delivery systems containing GSIs and surface modified with DR-5 and DLL4 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to effectivity target and treat TNBC. The delivery system is designed to deliver the drug cargo precisely to TNBCs through its DR-5 receptors and hence expected to reduce the off-target side effects of GSIs. Further, DLL4 mAb and GSIs are expected to act synergistically to block the Notch signal mediated BCSCs proliferation, differentiation, and metastasis."

The presence of one or more of these receptors suggests that a treatment targeting these pathways might be effective, while the absence of, or in the case of HER2, lack of overexpression of, all of these receptors, termed triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), indicates a need for the more toxic chemotherapy. In an effort to develop targeted therapies for TNBC, it will be necessary to differentiate among specific TNBC subtypes. The subset of TNBC that expresses androgen receptor (AR) has been determined to express genes consistent with a luminal subtype and therefore may be amenable to therapies targeting either AR, itself, or other pathways typical of a luminal subtype. Recent investigations of the AR signal pathway within breast cancer lead to AR as a significant target for breast cancer therapy with several clinical trials currently in progress. The subclass of TNBC that lacks AR, which we have termed quadruple negative breast cancer (QNBC) currently lacks a defined targetable pathway. Unlike AR-positive TNBC, QNBC predominantly exhibits a basal-like molecular subtype. Several subtypes and related pathway proteins are preferentially expressed in QNBC that may serve as effective targets for treatment, such as ACSL4, SKP2 and EGFR. ACSL4 expression has been demonstrated to be inversely correlated with expression of hormone/growth factor receptors and may thus serve as a biomarker for QNBC as well as a target for therapy. In the following review we summarize some of the current efforts to develop alternatives to chemotherapy for TNBC and QNBC."

However, the efficacy of this treatment strategy is limited for treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Gene therapy may be a more effective strategy for improving the prognosis of TNBC. Methods: A novel 25 nucleotide sense strand of miRNA was designed to treat TNBC by silencing the Slug gene, and encapsulated into DSPE-PEG2000-tLyp-1 peptide-modified functional liposomes. The efficacy of miRNA liposomes was evaluated on invasive TNBC cells and TNBC cancer-bearing nude mice. Furthermore, functional vinorelbine liposomes were constructed to investigate the anticancer effects of combined treatment. Results: The functional miRNA liposomes had a round shape and were nanosized (120 nm). Functional miRNA liposomes were effectively captured by TNBC cells in vitro and were target to mitochondria. Treatment with functional liposomes silenced the expression of Slug and Slug protein, inhibited the TGF-β1/Smad pathway, and inhibited invasiveness and growth of TNBC cells. In TNBC cancer-bearing mice, functional miRNA liposomes exerted a stronger anticancer effect than functional vinorelbine liposomes, and combination therapy with these two formulations resulted in nearly complete inhibition of tumor growth. Preliminary safety evaluations indicated that the functional miRNA liposomes did not affect body weight or cause damage to any major organs. Furthermore, the functional liposomes significantly increased the half-life of the drug in the blood of cancer-bearing nude mice, and increased drug accumulation in breast cancer tissues. Conclusion: In this study, we constructed novel functional miRNA liposomes. These liposomes silenced Slug expression and inhibited the TGF-β1/Smad pathway in TNBC cells, and enhanced anticancer efficacy in mice using combined chemotherapy. Hence, the present study demonstrated a promising strategy for gene therapy of invasive breast cancer."

For years, TNBC has been considered to be a difficult-to-treat tumour due to its generally aggressive tumour biology and in view of limited therapeutic options. The risk of recurrence and metastasis is higher than in the case of other breast cancer subtypes of the same stage. In addition to surgery and radiation in the curative situation, systemic chemotherapy with anthracyclines and/or taxanes is still the therapy of choice. New therapeutic approaches are based on the knowledge that TNBC is a molecularly very heterogeneous disease. Research groups are working to classify TNBC better and better on a molecular level and use this molecular subtyping as the basis for new therapeutic strategies. The most promising new approaches and considerations regarding the therapy of TNBCs are shown below. In addition, the current therapeutic strategies are discussed using a fictitious case history, taking the current data and the resultant therapeutic consequence into account. Zusammenfassung Durch den raschen Erkenntnisgewinn zu Tumorbiologie und Tumorpathogenese des triple-negativen Mammakarzinoms (TNBC) ergeben sich neue Therapieansätze und neue Therapiekonzepte für die Behandlung.

Neben Operation und Bestrahlung in der kurativen Situation ist die systemische Chemotherapie mit Anthrazyklinen und/oder Taxanen nach wie vor die Therapie der Wahl. Neue Therapieansätze basieren auf der Erkenntnis, dass das TNBC eine molekular sehr heterogene Erkrankung ist. Forschungsgruppen arbeiten daran, das TNBC immer besser auf molekularer Ebene zu klassifizieren und diese molekulare Subtypisierung als Grundlage für neue therapeutische Strategien zu nutzen. Im Folgenden werden die vielversprechendsten neuen Ansätze und Überlegungen zur Therapie des TNBCs dargestellt.

The high biological and clinical heterogeneity adds a further challenge to TNBC management and requires the identification of new biomarkers to improve detection by imaging, thus allowing the specific treatment of each individual TNBC subtype. The Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX) technique holds great promise to the search for novel targetable biomarkers, and aptamer-based molecular approaches have the potential to overcome obstacles of current imaging and therapy modalities. In this review, we highlight recent advances in oligonucleotide aptamers used as imaging and/or therapeutic agents in TNBC, discussing the potential options to discover, image and hit new actionable targets in TNBC."

Atezolizumab (atezo) is a humanized mAb that inhibits the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 and B7.1, thus restoring tumor-specific T-cell immunity. Atezo was evaluated in an expansion cohort of mTNBC patients (pts) in a Phase Ia study (NCT01375842). Methods. Enrollment was initially limited to TNBC pts with PD-L1 on ≥5% of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (IC2/3), then opened to pts regardless of PD-L1 status. Pts received atezo IV in 1L or 2L+ q3w at 15 or 20 mg/kg or 1200 mg for 1 y with option to be retreated at PD, or until loss of clinical benefit. ORR was assessed by RECIST v1.1 and irRC, to capture non-conventional responses. Baseline PD-L1 expression on IC was centrally scored as IC0/1/2/3 (VENTANA SP142 assay). Pretreatment tumors and on-therapy biopsies were evaluated for TILs, CD8 T cells and macrophages by IHC. Results. As of Mar 31, 2016, 115 mTNBC pts were safety evaluable; atezo was generally well tolerated. There were no additional safety signals from prior report (Emens AACR 2015). 112 pts with FU ≥12 wk were evaluable for response. Based on irRC, ORR in 1L and 2L+ pts were 26% and 11%, respectively. ORR for PD-L1 IC2/3 pts were 17% vs 8% in IC0/1. mDoR was 21.1 mo (3 to 34+). mOS of responders (n=15) was not reached (4+ to 37+ mo) with no deaths as of data cutoff. mOS of non-responders who lived ≥ 6 wk (n=87) was 9 mo (1+ to 19+ mo). OS rates in all pts at 1, 2, and 3 y were 41%, 22% and 22%, respectively. OS rates at 1, 2, and 3 y for PD-L1 IC2/3 were 45%, 28% and 28%, respectively. Pts whose tumors had >10% TILs or ≥1.35% CD8 in the tumor center trended toward higher ORR and longer OS. Atezo increased intratumoral TILs, CD8, macrophages and IC PD-L1 expression, but no response association was observed. Conclusions. In mTNBC, atezo was well tolerated. Responders showed durable clinical benefit. Response rates were higher in 1L or PD-L1 IC2/3 pts. Baseline TILs and CD8 were associated with greater clinical benefit.

The management of TNBC represents a challenge due to its aggressive phenotype, heterogeneity and lack of targeted therapy. Loss of cell differentiation and enrichment with breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSC) are features of TNBC contributing to its aggressive nature. Here, we found that PRL treatment of TNBC cells to significantly depletes the highly tumorigenic BCSC subpopulations CD44+/CD24- and ALDH+ and differentiate them to the least tumorigenic CD44-/CD24- and ALDH- phenotype with limited tumorsphere formation and self-renewal capacities. Importantly, we found PRL to induce a heterochromatin phenotype marked by histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and accompanied by ultrastructural cellular architecture associated with differentiation and senescence rendering the cells refractory to growth signals. Crucially, we found PRL to mediate these effects in vivo in a preclinical animal xenograft of TNBC controlling tumor growth. These results reveal that the lactogenic hormone PRL may exert its anti-tumorigenic effects in TNBC through cellular reprogramming indicative of differentiation resulting in depletion of BCSCs and restricting tumorigenesis."

Bevacizumab adds to the efficacy of chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer; however, there is limited data on the safety or efficacy of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. Thus, we sought to explore the safety and efficacy of the addition of bevacizumab to cisplatin in the treatment of TNBC.


METHODS
51 patients (pts) with confirmed TNBC provided informed consent and were enrolled in a single arm phase II trial of neoadjuvant cisplatin 75 mg/m2 q 3 weeks x 4 cycles and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg q 3 weeks x 3 cycles prior to definitive surgery. Only 3 cycles of bevacizumab were delivered to allow 6 weeks between the last dose of bevacizumab and surgery. Research biopsies were obtained and breast MRI performed before treatment and at surgery. Postoperatively, pts received doxorubicin and cytoxan (AC) plus bevacizumab or AC/Taxol plus bevacizumab. Median age was 50 yrs (range 30 to 66 yrs); tumors were clinical T1 (2%), T2 (80%), T3 (18%).


RESULTS
Forty-six pts are evaluable for response and 5 pts are still receiving neoadjuvant therapy. Clinical responses to date: 12/46 (26%) clinical complete response (cCR), 24/46 (52%) clinical partial response (cPR), 5/46 (11%) stable disease (SD), and 1/46 (2%) progressive disease (PD). Non-responders included 4/46 (9%) pts who discontinued protocol therapy for toxicity. To date, 7/46 (15%) pts achieved a complete pathological response (Miller-Payne 5) and an additional 10/46 (22%) were Miller-Payne 4. Five pts did not complete neoadjuvant therapy, 2 with tinnitus/hearing loss and 3 with grade 4 toxicities consisting of refractory hypertension in 1 pt and pulmonary embolism (PE) in 2 pts. Tissue-based assays to predict platinum/bevacizumab responses, including BRCA1/2 status, are underway.


CONCLUSIONS
Cisplatin and bevacizumab has some activity in TNBC as demonstrated by 37% of evaluable pts with a Miller-Payne 4 or 5 pathological response. However, toxicity, including tinnitus/hearing loss, hypertension and PE, limited completion of neoadjuvant therapy in 11% of pts. No significant financial relationships to disclose."

The lack of targeted therapies available for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients who fail to respond to first-line chemotherapy has sparked interest in immunotherapeutic approaches. However, trials utilizing checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in TNBC have had underwhelming responses. Here, we investigated the interplay between type I IFN signaling and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and tested the impact of combining IFN inducers, as immune activators, with anti–PD-1, to induce an antimetastatic immune response. Using models of TNBC, we demonstrated an interplay between type I IFN signaling and tumor cell PD-L1 expression that affected therapeutic response. The data revealed that the type I IFN-inducer poly(I:C) was an effective immune activator and antimetastatic agent, functioning better than anti–PD-1, which was ineffective as a single agent. Poly(I:C) treatment induced PD-L1 expression on TNBC cells, and combined poly(I:C) and anti–PD-1 treatment prolonged metastasis-free survival in a neoadjuvant setting via the induction of a tumor-specific T-cell response. Use of this combination in a late treatment setting did not impact metastasis-free survival, indicating that timing was critical for immunotherapeutic benefit. Together, these data demonstrated anti–PD-1 as an ineffective single agent in preclinical models of TNBC. However, type I IFN inducers were effective immune activators, and neoadjuvant trials combining them with anti–PD-1 to induce a sustained antitumor immune response are warranted.

While targeted therapies for TNBC are in various stages of development, current standard chemotherapies include taxanes such as paclitaxel and anthracycline agents. With the objective of specifically targeting invasive cancer, our group has been developing small-molecule inhibitors of the Rho GTPases Rac and Cdc42, which are known drivers of cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Of these, MBQ-167 inhibits both Rac and Cdc42 with IC50s of 103 and 78 nmol/L, respectively, and consequently inhibits p21-activated kinase (PAK) signaling, metastatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, tumor growth, and metastasis (Humphries-Bickley et al., Mol Cancer Ther 2017). We found that in addition to blocking HER2-type breast cancer progression, MBQ-167 is also highly effective against TNBC cell and tumor growth, as well as metastasis in mouse models. The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of MBQ-167 in combination with the current chemotherapeutic paclitaxel. We hypothesized that the combination of paclitaxel and MBQ-167 is a rational strategy to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in TNBC. To test this hypothesis, we administered a nontoxic dosage of individual MBQ-167, paclitaxel, or combined MBQ-167 and paclitaxel to immunocompromised mice bearing mammary fat pad tumors from GFP-tagged MDA-MB-468 or MDA-MB-231 human TNBC cells. Tumor growth was monitored weekly and metastasis was quantified at the end of the study. Treatment with MBQ-167 and/or paclitaxel resulted in reduced tumor growth by 70-80% in both models. In the MDA-MB-231 model, MBQ-167 paralleled paclitaxel treatment with a modest benefit in combined therapy. However, in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive TNBC model MDA-MB-468, MBQ-167 alone or in combination significantly reduced metastasis to the lungs and spleen, while paclitaxel alone increased metastasis to the liver, lungs, and spleen. These results show that MBQ-167 is a promising antimetastatic agent that can be effective in combination with current chemotherapeutic agents.

In this study, we investigated the predictive factor of recurrence in TNBC using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-imaging mass spectrometry for lipid profiling of breast cancer specimens obtained from three and six patients with recurrent and non-recurrent TNBC, respectively. The signal for phosphatidylcholine (PC) (32:1) at m/z 732.5 was significantly higher in the recurrence group compared to the non-recurrence group (P = 0.024). PC (32:1) was more abundant in the cancer epithelial area than it was in the surrounding stroma, suggesting that abnormal lipid metabolism was associated with malignant transformation. Our results indicate PC (32:1) as a candidate predictive factor of TNBC recurrence.

Introduction: TNBC is a mutationally complex breast cancer subtype with poor prognosis and no current targeted therapy options. Compared with other intrinsic breast cancer subtypes, TNBC has higher programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels, which may hinder antitumor T-cell responses. MPDL3280A is a monoclonal anti-PDL1 antibody, engineered for optimized efficacy and safety, that blocks signaling through the PD-L1/PD-1 and PD-L1/B7.1 pathways.

Methods: MPDL3280A was tested in a metastatic TNBC expansion cohort as part of a multicenter Phase Ia study. Pts received MPDL3280A at 15 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg or 1200 mg flat dose IV q3w. AEs were summarized for the safety follow-up duration from the first dose to 30 days after the last dose before the clinical cutoff on Sept 2, 2014. Responses were assessed by RECIST v1.1 criteria in pts who received MPDL3280A by Jul 21, 2014, evaluable for efficacy (≥ 6-wk follow-up). PD-L1 expression on tumor-infiltrating immune cells (ICs) at baseline was centrally evaluated by IHC in archival or fresh biopsies, and pts were scored as PD-L1 IHC (IC) 0, 1, 2 or 3. Peripheral biomarkers were assayed using FACS and multiplex immunoassays.

Results: In the TNBC cohort, 27 pts were selectively enrolled. These pts had a median age of 48 y (29-82 y) and were evaluable for safety; 52% had ECOG PS 0 and 44% had ECOG PS 1. Visceral and bone metastases were present at baseline in 59% and 11% of pts, respectively. In addition, 85% received ≥ 4 prior systemic regimens (neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic), including anthracyclines (78%), taxanes (82%) and platinum agents (15% cisplatin, 41% carboplatin). All-grade treatment-related AEs occurred in 67% of pts, most frequently fatigue (22%), pyrexia (15%), neutropenia (15%) and nausea (15%). 11% of pts experienced a Grade 3-5 related AE (5 Grade 3 events: adrenal insufficiency, neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, decreased WBC count; 1 Grade 5 pulmonary hypertension event in a pt with an atrial septal defect). Among 21 efficacy-evaluable PD-L1 IHC 2 or 3 pts (13 IHC 2 and 8 IHC 3), the unconfirmed RECIST ORR was 24% (95% CI, 8% to 47%); 3 PRs and 2 CRs were observed. Response duration ranged from 0.1+ to 41.6+ wks, with the median not yet reached. Pts with evidence of durable nonclassical responses suggestive of pseudoprogression were also observed. Overall, the 24-wk PFS rate was 33% (95% CI, 12% to 53%). Biomarker analysis revealed transient elevation of plasma cytokines and proliferating CD8 cells following MPDL3280A treatment. Updated clinical data, including PD-L1-negative pts, will be presented.

Conclusions: MPDL3280A was generally well tolerated and demonstrated promising efficacy in pretreated metastatic PD-L1 IHC 2 or 3 TNBC pts. Furthermore, circulating biomarker analyses revealed pharmacodynamic responses to MPDL3280A. Clinical evaluation of MPDL3280A in metastatic PD-L1 IHC 0 or 1 TNBC is ongoing ([NCT01375842][1]).

Our previous study showed that downregulating syndecan-binding protein (SDCBP) in TNBC inhibits the proliferation of TNBC cells. Dasatinib is a new small-molecule inhibitor of c-src phosphorylation. The aim of this study was to investigate if SDCBP is a potential marker to indicate whether a TNBC is suitable for dasatinib therapy. This study applied co-immunoprecipitation to identify the interaction between SDCBP and c-src in TNBC cell lines. In addition, immunohistochemistry was used to investigate SDCBP and tyrosine-419 phosphorylated c-src (p-c-src-Y419) expression in TNBC tissues. SDCBP-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells were then constructed to evaluate the effects of dasatinib on SDCBP-induced TNBC progression in vitro and tumor formation in nude mice. We found wild-type SDCBP interacted with c-src and promoted the phosphorylation of c-src; this phosphorylation was completely blocked by dasatinib. SDCBP lacking the PDZ domain had no such effect. Among the 52 consecutive random TNBC cases examined, the expression of SDCBP was consistent with that of p-c-src-Y419, and positively correlated with histological grading or Ki-67 levels. SDCBP overexpression significantly accelerated the proliferation and cell cycle progression of the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231; these effects were prevented by dasatinib treatment. However, the subsequent inhibition of p27 expression partially restored the proliferation and viability of the TNBC cells. The results of this study suggest that SDCBP interacts with c-src, regulates G1/S in TNBC cells, and enhances tumor cell proliferation by promoting the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-src at residue 419. Dasatinib inhibits such phosphorylation and blocks SDCBP-induced cell cycle progression. Therefore, SDCBP might be an important marker for identifying TNBC cases that are suitable for dasatinib therapy."

However, the utility of CEA and CA15-3 levels as conventional cancer biomarkers in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains controversial. The current study was performed to explore the predictive value of pre-therapeutic serum CEA and CA15-3 levels, and nomograms were developed including these serum cancer biomarkers to improve the prognostic evaluation of TNBC patients. Pre-therapeutic CA15-3 and CEA concentrations were measured in 247 patients with stage I–IV TNBC. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that TNBC patients with high levels of both CEA and CA15-3 had shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates than those in the low-level groups (p<0.05). Multivariate analysis suggested that pre-therapeutic CA15-3 and CEA levels are independent predictive elements for OS (p = 0.022 and p = 0.040, respectively) and DFS (p = 0.023 and p = 0.028, respectively). In addition, novel nomograms were established and validated to provide personal forecasts of OS and DFS for patients with TNBC. These novel nomograms may help physicians to select the optimal treatment plans to ensure the best outcomes for TNBC patients."
MiR-27a Modulates Radiosensitivity of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) Cells by Targeting CDC27,"[{'authorId': '46300922', 'name': 'Yong-qiang Ren'}, {'authorId': '2083632068', 'name': 'Fengkui Fu'}, {'authorId': '1780602', 'name': 'Jianjun Han'}]",54,2015,57bc34cf82d275ac24009ca2858f1c180c4cc42c,"Background MiR-27a is significantly overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the exact biological function of MiR-27a in TNBC is not fully understood. In this study, we verified miR-27a expression in TNBC cells and explored how its overexpression modulates radiosensitivity of the cells. Material/Method qRT-PCR analysis was performed to study miR-27a expression in TNBC lines MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 and in normal human breast epithelial cell line MCF10A. Dual luciferase assay was performed to verify a putative downstream target of miR-27a, CDC27. CCK-8 assay was used to assess the influence of miR-27a-CDC27 axis on cell proliferation under irradiation (IR) treatment. Results We confirmed significantly higher miR-27a expression in 2 TNBC cell lines – MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 – than in human breast epithelial cell line MCF10A. miR-27a could modulate proliferation and radiosensitivity of TNBC cells. CDC-27 is a direct target of miR-27a and its downregulation conferred increased radioresistance of the cells. Conclusions The miR-27a-CDC27 axis might play an important role in modulating response to radiotherapy in TNBC cells. Testing miR-27a expression might be a useful way to identify a subgroup of patients who will benefit from an IR-based therapeutic approach."

There is a vital need for effective targeted therapeutics for TNBC patients, yet treatment strategies are challenged by the significant intertumoral heterogeneity within the TNBC subtype and its surrounding microenvironment. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) are highly expressed in several TNBC subtypes and are promising therapeutic targets. In this study, we targeted the MET receptor, which is highly expressed across several TNBC subtypes. Experimental Design: Using the small-molecule inhibitor cabozantinib (XL184), we examined the efficacy of MET inhibition in preclinical models that recapitulate human TNBC and its microenvironment. To analyze the dynamic interactions between TNBC cells and fibroblasts over time, we utilized a 3D model referred to as MAME (Mammary Architecture and Microenvironment Engineering) with quantitative image analysis. To investigate cabozantinib inhibition in vivo, we used a novel xenograft model that expresses human HGF and supports paracrine MET signaling. Results: XL184 treatment of MAME cultures of MDA-MB-231 and HCC70 cells (± HGF-expressing fibroblasts) was cytotoxic and significantly reduced multicellular invasive outgrowths, even in cultures with HGF-expressing fibroblasts. Treatment with XL184 had no significant effects on METneg breast cancer cell growth. In vivo assays demonstrated that cabozantinib treatment significantly inhibited TNBC growth and metastasis. Conclusions: Using preclinical TNBC models that recapitulate the breast tumor microenvironment, we demonstrate that cabozantinib inhibition is an effective therapeutic strategy in several TNBC subtypes.

However, this treatment is ineffective for unknown reasons. Here, we report that aberrant expression of wingless-type MMTV integration site family (WNT) and activated WNT signals, which crosstalk with the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway through GSK3β, plays the most critical role in resistance to pan-PI3K inhibitors in TNBC cells. GDC-0941 is a pan-PI3K inhibitor that activates the WNT/beta-catenin pathway in TNBC cells through stimulation of WNT secretion. GDC-0941-triggered WNT/beta-catenin pathway activation was observed in MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells, which are TNBC cell lines showing aberrant WNT/beta-catenin activation, and not in SKBR3 and MCF7 cells. This observation is further investigated in vivo. GDC-0941 exhibited minimal tumor inhibition in MDA-MB-231 cells, but it significantly suppressed tumor growth in HER-positive SK-BR3 cells. In vivo mechanism study revealed the activation of WNT/beta-catenin pathway by GDC-0941. A synergistic effect was observed when combined treatment with GDC-0941 and the WNT inhibitor LGK974 at low concentrations in MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings indicated that WNT pathway activation conferred resistance in TNBC cells treated with GDC-0941. This resistance may be further circumvented through combined treatment with pan-PI3K and WNT inhibitors. Future clinical trials of these two inhibitors are warranted."

EndoTAG-1, composed of paclitaxel embedded in liposomal membranes targeting tumor endothelial cells, was evaluated for safety and efficacy in advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
One hundred and forty patients were treated with weekly EndoTAG-1 (22 mg/m(2)) plus paclitaxel (70 mg/m(2)), twice weekly EndoTAG-1 (2× 44 mg/m(2)), or weekly paclitaxel (90 mg/m(2)) for greater than or equal to four cycles (3-week treatment + 1-week rest) or until progression/toxicity. Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) rate evaluated centrally after four cycles of therapy (week 16). The study was not powered for intergroup comparisons.


RESULTS
The PFS rate at week 16 was 59.1% [one-sided 95% CI: 45.6, ∞] on combination treatment, 34.2% [21.6, ∞] on EndoTAG-1, and 48.0% [30.5, ∞] on paclitaxel. Median PFS reached 4.2, 3.4, and 3.7 months, respectively. After complete treatment (week 41 analysis), median overall survival (OS) was 13.0, 11.9, and 13.1 months for the modified Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population and 15.1, 12.5, and 8.9 months for the per-protocol population, respectively. The clinical benefit rate was 53%, 31%, and 36% for the treatment groups. Safety analysis revealed known toxicities of the drugs with slight increases of grade 3/4 neutropenia on combination therapy.


CONCLUSION
Treatment of advanced TNBC with a combination of EndoTAG-1 and standard paclitaxel [Taxol® (Bristol-Myers Squibb GmbH), or equivalent generic formulation] was well tolerated and showed antitumor efficacy. The positive trend needs to be confirmed in a randomized phase III trial.

Thus, pCR rates may be useful in evaluating novel regimens in TNBC. In advanced TNBC, platinum analogues like Cb are active and addition of B to chemotherapy increases response rates and time to progression. CALGB 40603 is a 2×2 randomized phase II study designed to determine if the addition of either Cb or B to standard NAC significantly increases pCR rates in TNBC. Methods: Pts had operable clinical stage II-III TNBC, defined as hormone receptors Results: 454 pts enrolled, median age 48, stage II 68%/stage III 32%. Of 354 pts with treatment data, 59 did not complete NAC, 30 withdrew due to AEs, more often with B vs. not (11.5% vs. 3.5%). B was discontinued in 23% of assigned pts vs. 6-13% for other agents. Grade 3-4 neutropenia (56% vs. 20%) and thrombocytopenia (22% vs. 4%) were more common with Cb vs. not, while grade 3 hypertension was more common with B vs. not (11% vs. There is no evidence of an interaction between the effects of Cb and B (p = 0.64 and 0.44, for breast and breast/axilla, respectively). Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest that adding Cb or B to standard NAC significantly increases pCR rates in stage II-III TNBC. These increases are additive, with pCR (breast) in 60.6% and pCR (breast/axilla) in 50% of pts who received both.

The lack of expression of targetable proteins such as the estrogen receptor and absence of HER2 amplification have made relying on cytotoxic chemotherapy necessary for decades. In the operable setting, efforts to improve outcomes have focused on escalation of systemic therapy and a shift toward preoperative delivery followed by a response adapted approach to postoperative systemic therapy. An improved understanding of tumor biology has resulted in the identification of subsets of patients with specific molecular features, leading to testing and approval of multiple new targeted therapies for this disease. Furthermore, advances in drug development have led to the approval of antibody-drug conjugates that are redefining classification schemes for breast cancer. This review focuses on the modern management of TNBC, with particular focus on recent updates in the treatment of operable disease, and an overview of the most recent promising advances in the therapeutic landscape of metastatic disease. It discusses the practical challenges and unanswered questions resulting from the approval of neoadjuvant immunotherapy and shares an approach in the clinic on topics for which evidence is lacking. In addition, it provides a glimpse into the future, highlighting challenges and opportunities for biomarker based right-sizing of preoperative therapy, refining evaluation of response to preoperative therapy after surgery, early diagnosis and detection of relapse, and areas of needed research for metastatic TNBC."

The survival rate for TNBC is generally worse than other breast cancer subtypes. TNBC treatment has made significant advances, but certain limitations remain. Treatment for TNBC can be challenging since the disease has various molecular subtypes. A variety of treatment options are available, such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. Chemotherapy is the most common of these options. TNBC is generally treated with systemic chemotherapy using drugs such as anthracyclines and taxanes in neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings. Developing resistance to anticancer drugs and off-target toxicity are the primary hindrances to chemotherapeutic solutions for cancer. It is imperative that researchers, clinicians, and pharmaceutical companies work together to develop effective treatment options for TNBC. Several studies have suggested nanotechnology as a potential solution to the problem of suboptimal TNBC treatment. In this review, we summarized possible treatment options for TNBC, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, combination therapy, and nanoparticle-based therapy, and some solutions for the treatment of TNBC in the future.

The identification of biomarkers predicting the response to NAC could be helpful for personalized treatment. This systematic review provides an overview of putative biomarkers at baseline that are predictive for a pCR following NAC. Embase, Medline and Web of Science were searched for articles published between January 2010 and August 2022. The articles had to meet the following criteria: patients with primary invasive TNBC without distant metastases and patients must have received NAC. In total, 2045 articles were screened by two reviewers resulting in the inclusion of 92 articles. Overall, the most frequently reported biomarkers associated with a pCR were a high expression of Ki-67, an expression of PD-L1 and the abundance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, particularly CD8+ T cells, and corresponding immune gene signatures. In addition, our review reveals proteomic, genomic and transcriptomic markers that relate to cancer cells, the tumor microenvironment and the peripheral blood, which also affect chemo-sensitivity. We conclude that a prediction model based on a combination of tumor and immune markers is likely to better stratify TNBC patients with respect to NAC response."

Among the novel therapies that have been approved for the clinical management of TNBC, immunotherapy shows great potential. Although exciting progress has been made in immunotherapy for TNBC, there are still gaps to fill. This review will analyze current immunotherapy strategies in TNBC, summarize the current landscape of clinical trials, review the results achieved, and shed light on future developments. Abstract Due to the absence of hormone receptor (both estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors) along with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) amplification, the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cannot benefit from endocrine or anti-HER-2 therapy. For a long time, chemotherapy was the only systemic treatment for TNBC. Due to the lack of effective treatment options, the prognosis for TNBC is extremely poor. The successful application of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) launched the era of immunotherapy in TNBC. However, the current findings show modest efficacy of programmed cell death- (ligand) 1 (PD-(L)1) inhibitors monotherapy and only a small proportion of patients can benefit from this approach. Based on the basic principles of immunotherapy and the characteristics of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in TNBC, immune combination therapy is expected to further enhance the efficacy and expand the beneficiary population of patients. Given the diversity of drugs that can be combined, it is important to select effective biomarkers to identify the target population. Moreover, the side effects associated with the combination of multiple drugs should also be considered."

In recent years, emphasis has been placed on the identification of mechanisms underlying the complex genomic and biological profile of TNBC, aiming to tailor treatment strategies. High immunogenicity, specific immune activation signatures, higher expression of immunosuppressive genes and higher levels of stromal Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes, constitute some of the key elements of the immune driven landscape associated with TNBC. The unprecedented response of TNBC to immunotherapy has undoubtedly changed the standard of care in this disease both in the early and the metastatic setting. However, the extent of interplay between immune infiltration and mutational signatures in TNBC is yet to be fully unravelled. In the present review, we present clinical evidence on the immunogenicity and tumour microenvironment influence on TNBC progression and the current treatment paradigms in TNBC based on immunotherapy."

We identified an unexpected protein vulnerability in p53-inactivated TNBC and designed a new PROTAC to target it. Our PROTAC selectively targets MDM2 for proteasome-mediated degradation with high-affinity binding and VHL recruitment. MDM2 loss in p53 mutant/deleted TNBC cells in 2D/3D culture and TNBC patient explants, including relapsed tumors, causes apoptosis, while sparing normal cells. Our MDM2-PROTAC is stable in vivo, and treatment of TNBC xenograft-bearing mice demonstrates tumor on-target efficacy with no toxicity to normal cells, significantly extending survival. Transcriptomic analyses revealed upregulation of p53 family target genes. Investigations showed activation and a required role for TAp73 to mediate MDM2-PROTAC-induced apoptosis. Our data, challenging the current MDM2/p53 paradigm, show MDM2 is required for p53-inactivated TNBC cell survival, and PROTAC-targeted MDM2 degradation is an innovative potential therapeutic strategy for TNBC and superior to existing MDM2 inhibitors."

In recent years, immunotherapy has emerged as a new treatment option for patients with TNBC. However, this therapeutic evolution is paralleled by a growing need for biomarkers which allow for a better selection of patients who are most likely to benefit from this immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based regimen. These biomarkers will not only facilitate a better optimization of treatment strategies, but they will also avoid unnecessary side effects in non-responders, and limit the increasing financial toxicity linked to the use of these agents. Huge efforts have been deployed to identify predictive biomarkers for the ICI, but until now, the fruits of this labor remained largely unsatisfactory. Among clinically validated biomarkers, only programmed death-ligand 1 protein (PD-L1) expression has been prospectively assessed in TNBC trials. In addition to this, microsatellite instability and a high tumor mutational burden are approved as tumor agnostic biomarkers, but only a small percentage of TNBC fits this category. Furthermore, TNBC should no longer be approached as a single biological entity, but rather as a complex disease with different molecular, clinicopathological, and tumor microenvironment subgroups. This review provides an overview of the validated and evolving predictive biomarkers for a response to ICI in TNBC."

We determined that intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1), a cell surface receptor overexpressed in TNBC, efficiently facilitates receptor-mediated antibody internalization. We next constructed a panel of four ICAM1 ADCs using different chemical linkers and warheads and compared their in vitro and in vivo efficacies against multiple human TNBC cell lines and a series of standard, late-stage, and refractory TNBC in vivo models. An ICAM1 antibody conjugated with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a protease-cleavable valine-citrulline linker was identified as the optimal ADC formulation owing to its outstanding efficacy and safety, representing an effective ADC candidate for TNBC therapy."

Immune checkpoint inhibition has been demonstrated to be an effective anticancer strategy. Several lines of evidence support the study of immunotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We assessed the safety and antitumor activity of the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor pembrolizumab in patients with advanced TNBC.


METHODS
KEYNOTE-012 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01848834) was a multicenter, nonrandomized phase Ib trial of single-agent pembrolizumab given intravenously at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks to patients with advanced PD-L1-positive (expression in stroma or ≥ 1% of tumor cells by immunohistochemistry) TNBC, gastric cancer, urothelial cancer, and head and neck cancer. This report focuses on the TNBC cohort.


RESULTS
Among 111 patients with TNBC whose tumor samples were screened for PD-L1 expression, 58.6% had PD-L1-positive tumors. Thirty-two women (median age, 50.5 years; range, 29 to 72 years) were enrolled and assessed for safety and antitumor activity. The median number of doses administered was five (range, 1 to 36 doses). Common toxicities were mild and similar to those observed in other tumor cohorts (eg, arthralgia, fatigue, myalgia, and nausea), and included five (15.6%) patients with grade ≥ 3 toxicity and one treatment-related death. Among the 27 patients who were evaluable for antitumor activity, the overall response rate was 18.5%, the median time to response was 17.9 weeks (range, 7.3 to 32.4 weeks), and the median duration of response was not yet reached (range, 15.0 to ≥ 47.3 weeks).


CONCLUSION
This phase Ib study describes preliminary evidence of clinical activity and a potentially acceptable safety profile of pembrolizumab given every 2 weeks to patients with heavily pretreated, advanced TNBC. A single-agent phase II study examining a 200-mg dose given once every 3 weeks (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02447003) is ongoing."

One third of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) achieve pathologic complete response (pCR) with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). CALGB 40603 (Alliance), a 2 × 2 factorial, open-label, randomized phase II trial, evaluated the impact of adding carboplatin and/or bevacizumab.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients (N = 443) with stage II to III TNBC received paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) once per week (wP) for 12 weeks, followed by doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide once every 2 weeks (ddAC) for four cycles, and were randomly assigned to concurrent carboplatin (area under curve 6) once every 3 weeks for four cycles and/or bevacizumab 10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks for nine cycles. Effects of adding these agents on pCR breast (ypT0/is), pCR breast/axilla (ypT0/isN0), treatment delivery, and toxicities were analyzed.


RESULTS
Patients assigned to either carboplatin or bevacizumab were less likely to complete wP and ddAC without skipped doses, dose modification, or early discontinuation resulting from toxicity. Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were more common with carboplatin, as were hypertension, infection, thromboembolic events, bleeding, and postoperative complications with bevacizumab. Employing one-sided P values, addition of either carboplatin (60% v 44%; P = .0018) or bevacizumab (59% v 48%; P = .0089) significantly increased pCR breast, whereas only carboplatin (54% v 41%; P = .0029) significantly raised pCR breast/axilla. More-than-additive interactions between the two agents could not be demonstrated.


CONCLUSION
In stage II to III TNBC, addition of either carboplatin or bevacizumab to NACT increased pCR rates, but whether this will improve relapse-free or overall survival is unknown. Given results from recently reported adjuvant trials, further investigation of bevacizumab in this setting is unlikely, but the role of carboplatin could be evaluated in definitive studies, ideally limited to biologically defined patient subsets most likely to benefit from this agent."

Of these, prognosis is worst for BLIS tumors and best for BLIA tumors for both DFS (log-rank test: P = 0.042 and 0.041, respectively) and DSS (log-rank test: P = 0.039 and 0.029, respectively). DNA copy number analysis produced two major groups (LAR and MES/BLIS/BLIA) and suggested that gene amplification drives gene expression in some cases [FGFR2 (BLIS)]. Putative subtype-specific targets were identified: (i) LAR: androgen receptor and the cell surface mucin MUC1, (ii) MES: growth factor receptors [platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor A; c-Kit], (iii) BLIS: an immunosuppressing molecule (VTCN1), and (iv) BLIA: Stat signal transduction molecules and cytokines. Conclusion: There are four stable TNBC subtypes characterized by the expression of distinct molecular profiles that have distinct prognoses. These studies identify novel subtype-specific targets that can be targeted in the future for the effective treatment of TNBCs. Clin Cancer Res; 21(7); 1688–98. ©2014 AACR.

Intracellular PD-L1 can also protect messenger RNAs of several DNA damage repair–related genes from degradation and enhance tumor resistance to DNA-damaging therapy. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has the worst prognosis and highest risk of distant relapse in breast cancer and shows resistance to immunotherapy and radiotherapy. In this study, we found that D-mannose can promote the degradation of PD-L1 and significantly enhance immunotherapy and radiotherapy of TNBC. Since TNBC treatment is still a clinical challenge, our findings provide strategies to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of TNBC and may have clinical application. Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in women worldwide, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients have the worst prognosis and highest risk of recurrence. The therapeutic strategies for TNBC are limited. It is urgent to develop new methods to enhance the efficacy of TNBC treatment. Previous studies demonstrated that D-mannose, a hexose, can enhance chemotherapy in cancer and suppress the immunopathology of autoimmune diseases. Here, we show that D-mannose can significantly facilitate TNBC treatment via degradation of PD-L1. Specifically, D-mannose can activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to phosphorylate PD-L1 at S195, which leads to abnormal glycosylation and proteasomal degradation of PD-L1. D-mannose–mediated PD-L1 degradation promotes T cell activation and T cell killing of tumor cells. The combination of D-mannose and PD-1 blockade therapy dramatically inhibits TNBC growth and extends the lifespan of tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, D-mannose–induced PD-L1 degradation also results in messenger RNA destabilization of DNA damage repair–related genes, thereby sensitizing breast cancer cells to ionizing radiation (IR) treatment and facilitating radiotherapy of TNBC in mice. Of note, the effective level of D-mannose can be easily achieved by oral administration in mice. Our study unveils a mechanism by which D-mannose targets PD-L1 for degradation and provides methods to facilitate immunotherapy and radiotherapy in TNBC. This function of D-mannose may be useful for clinical treatment of TNBC."

To date, therapies directed to specific molecular targets have rarely achieved clinically meaningful improvements in outcomes of patients with TNBC, and chemotherapy remains the standard of care. Here, we seek to review the most recent efforts to classify TNBC based on the comprehensive profiling of tumors for cellular composition and molecular features. Technologic advances allow for tumor characterization at ever-increasing depth, generating data that, if integrated with clinical-pathologic features, may help improve risk stratification of patients, guide treatment decisions and surveillance, and help identify new targets for drug development. SIGNIFICANCE: TNBC is characterized by higher rates of relapse, greater metastatic potential, and shorter overall survival compared with other major breast cancer subtypes. The identification of biomarkers that can help guide treatment decisions in TNBC remains a clinically unmet need. Understanding the mechanisms that drive resistance is key to the design of novel therapeutic strategies to help prevent the development of metastatic disease and, ultimately, to improve survival in this patient population."

The main treatment option remains chemotherapy, despite limited efficacy. New biologic and targeted agents are increasingly emerging for the treatment of TNBC. Given the continuous advances in the field of TNBC, this review assesses the latest developments in basic characterization, subtyping, and treatment of TNBC, including novel drug developments with antibody-drug conjugates, immune checkpoint inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and androgen receptor targeted agents. Abstract Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy affecting women. It is a highly heterogeneous disease broadly defined by the differential expression of cell surface receptors. In the United States, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents 15 to 20% of all BC. When compared with other subtypes of BC, TNBC tends to present in younger women, and has a higher mortality rate of 40% in advanced stages within the first 5 years after diagnosis. TNBC has historically had limited treatment options when compared to other types of BC. The mainstay of treatment for TNBC remains cytotoxic chemotherapy despite the emergence of new biologic and targeted agents. Defining the specific tumor molecular profile including PDL-1 and androgen receptor testing is expanding treatment options in the clinical setting. Identifying more targetable, novel biomarkers that may better define therapeutic targets or prognostic markers is currently underway. TNBC nomenclature is expected to be updated in favor of other nomenclature which would help direct therapy, and further redefine TNBC’s heterogeneity. Given the continuous advances in the field of TNBC, this review assesses the latest developments in basic characterization, subtyping, and treatment of TNBC, including novel drug developments with antibody-drug conjugates, immune checkpoint inhibitors, PARP inhibitors and androgen receptor targeted agents. Future trials are necessary in the face of these innovations to further support the use of new therapies in TNBC and the detection of the appropriate biomarkers."

TNBC tumors express molecular markers of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), but its requirement during spontaneous TNBC metastasis in vivo remains incompletely understood. We demonstrated that spontaneous TNBC tumors from a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM), multiple patient-derived xenografts, and archival patient samples exhibited large populations in vivo of hybrid E/M cells that lead invasion ex vivo while expressing both epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics. The mesenchymal marker vimentin promoted invasion and repressed metastatic outgrowth. We next tested the requirement for five EMT transcription factors and observed distinct patterns of utilization during invasion and colony formation. These differences suggested a sequential activation of multiple EMT molecular programs during the metastatic cascade. Consistent with this model, our longitudinal single-cell RNA analysis detected three different EMT-related molecular patterns. We observed cancer cells progressing from epithelial to hybrid E/M and strongly mesenchymal patterns during invasion and from epithelial to a hybrid E/M pattern during colony formation. We next investigated the relative epithelial versus mesenchymal state of cancer cells in both GEMM and patient metastases. In both contexts, we observed heterogeneity between and within metastases in the same individual. We observed a complex spectrum of epithelial, hybrid E/M, and mesenchymal cell states within metastases, suggesting that there are multiple successful molecular strategies for distant organ colonization. Together, our results demonstrate an important and complex role for EMT programs during TNBC metastasis. Description TNBC uses a vimentin-dependent hybrid EMT to generate metastases with diverse epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics. The dynamics of TNBC metastasis In breast cancer lacking expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, estrogen receptor, or progesterone receptor [triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)], the roles of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition in metastasis are unclear. Here, Grasset and colleagues characterized genetically engineered mouse models of TNBC, patient-derived xenografts, and TNBC tumor tissues from patients, identifying that the mesenchymal protein vimentin was required for TNBC invasion and metastasis formation. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that TNBC cancer cells progressed from epithelial to hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal states during both invasion and colony formation, with different transcription factors being required for invasion versus colony formation. This work suggests that EMT programs in TNBC metastasis are complex and might contribute to the development of treatment resistance."

Chemotherapy remains the standard of care for TNBC treatment, but unfortunately, patients frequently develop resistance. Accordingly, in recent years, tremendous effort has been made into elucidating the mechanisms of TNBC chemoresistance with the goal of identifying new molecular targets. It has become evident that the development of TNBC chemoresistance is multifaceted and based on the elaborate interplay of the tumor microenvironment, drug efflux, cancer stem cells, and bulk tumor cells. Alterations of multiple signaling pathways govern these interactions. Moreover, TNBC’s high heterogeneity, highlighted in the existence of several molecular signatures, presents a significant obstacle to successful treatment. In the present, in-depth review, we explore the contribution of key mechanisms to TNBC chemoresistance as well as emerging strategies to overcome them. We discuss novel anti-tumor agents that target the components of these mechanisms and pay special attention to their current clinical development while emphasizing the challenges still ahead of successful TNBC management. The evidence presented in this review outlines the role of crucial pathways in TNBC survival following chemotherapy treatment and highlights the importance of using combinatorial drug strategies and incorporating biomarkers in clinical studies."

However, the response rate of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 is still unsatisfactory, partly due to immunosuppressive factors such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β). In our previous pilot study, the bispecific antibody targeting TGF-β and murine PD-L1 (termed YM101) showed potent antitumor effect. In this work, we constructed a bispecific antibody targeting TGF-β and human PD-L1 (termed BiTP) and explored the antitumor effect of BiTP in TNBC. Methods BiTP was developed using Check-BODYTM bispecific platform. The binding affinity of BiTP was measured by surface plasmon resonance, ELISA, and flow cytometry. The bioactivity was assessed by Smad and NFAT luciferase reporter assays, immunofluorescence, western blotting, and superantigen stimulation assays. The antitumor activity of BiTP was explored in humanized epithelial-mesenchymal transition-6-hPDL1 and 4T1-hPDL1 murine TNBC models. Immunohistochemical staining, flow cytometry, and bulk RNA-seq were used to investigate the effect of BiTP on immune cell infiltration. Results BiTP exhibited high binding affinity to dual targets. In vitro experiments verified that BiTP effectively counteracted TGF-β-Smad and PD-L1-PD-1-NFAT signaling. In vivo animal experiments demonstrated that BiTP had superior antitumor activity relative to anti-PD-L1 and anti-TGF-β monotherapy. Mechanistically, BiTP decreased collagen deposition, enhanced CD8+ T cell penetration, and increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. This improved tumor microenvironment contributed to the potent antitumor activity of BiTP. Conclusion BiTP retains parent antibodies’ binding affinity and bioactivity, with superior antitumor activity to parent antibodies in TNBC. Our data suggest that BiTP might be a promising agent for TNBC treatment."

Breast cancers have been categorized into four major molecular subtypes based on the immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression of classic hormone and growth factor receptors including the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), as well as a proliferation marker Ki-67 protein expression. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a breast cancer subtype lacking ER, PR, and HER2 expression, is associated with a high metastatic potential and poor prognosis. TNBC accounts for approximately only 15%–20% of new breast cancer diagnoses; it is responsible for most breast cancer–related deaths due to the lack of targeted treatment options for this patient population, and currently, systemic chemotherapy, radiation, and surgical excision remain the major treatment modalities for these patients with TNBC. Although breast cancer patients in general do not have a robust response to the immunotherapy, a subset of TNBC has been demonstrated to have high tumor mutation burden and high tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, resembling the features observed on melanoma or lung cancers, which can benefit from the treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Therefore, the immunogenic nature of this aggressive disease has presented an opportunity for the development of TNBC-targeting immunotherapies. The recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of atezolizumab in combination with the chemotherapeutic agent nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of PD-L1-positive unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic TNBC has led to a new era of immunotherapy in TNBC treatment. In addition, immunotherapy becomes an active research area, both in the cancer biology field and in the oncology field. In this review, we will extend our coverage on recent discoveries in preclinical research and early results in clinical trials from immune molecule-based therapy including cytokines, monoclonal antibodies, antibody–drug conjugates, bi-specific or tri-specific antibodies, ICIs, and neoantigen cancer vaccines; oncolytic virus-based therapies and adoptive immune cell transfer–based therapies including TIL, chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T), CAR-NK, CAR-M, and T-cell receptor-T.

The first step in glutamine utilization is its conversion to glutamate by the mitochondrial enzyme glutaminase. CB-839 is a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of both splice variants of glutaminase (KGA and GAC). CB-839 had antiproliferative activity in a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, HCC-1806, that was associated with a marked decrease in glutamine consumption, glutamate production, oxygen consumption, and the steady-state levels of glutathione and several tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. In contrast, no antiproliferative activity was observed in an estrogen receptor–positive cell line, T47D, and only modest effects on glutamine consumption and downstream metabolites were observed. Across a panel of breast cancer cell lines, GAC protein expression and glutaminase activity were elevated in the majority of TNBC cell lines relative to receptor positive cells. Furthermore, the TNBC subtype displayed the greatest sensitivity to CB-839 treatment and this sensitivity was correlated with (i) dependence on extracellular glutamine for growth, (ii) intracellular glutamate and glutamine levels, and (iii) GAC (but not KGA) expression, a potential biomarker for sensitivity. CB-839 displayed significant antitumor activity in two xenograft models: as a single agent in a patient-derived TNBC model and in a basal like HER2+ cell line model, JIMT-1, both as a single agent and in combination with paclitaxel. Together, these data provide a strong rationale for the clinical investigation of CB-839 as a targeted therapeutic in patients with TNBC and other glutamine-dependent tumors.

Increased stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) have been associated with a favorable prognosis in TNBC. However, whether this association holds for patients who are node-negative (N0), young (< 40 years), and chemotherapy-naïve, and thus can be used for chemotherapy de-escalation strategies, is unknown. METHODS We selected all patients with N0 TNBC diagnosed between 1989 and 2000 from a Dutch population–based registry. Patients were age < 40 years at diagnosis and had not received (neo)adjuvant systemic therapy, as was standard practice at the time. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks were retrieved (PALGA: Dutch Pathology Registry), and a pathology review including sTILs was performed. Patients were categorized according to sTILs (< 30%, 30%-75%, and ≥ 75%). Multivariable Cox regression was performed for overall survival, with or without sTILs as a covariate. Cumulative incidence of distant metastasis or death was analyzed in a competing risk model, with second primary tumors as competing risk. RESULTS sTILs were scored for 441 patients. High sTILs (≥ 75%; 21%) translated into an excellent prognosis with a 15-year cumulative incidence of a distant metastasis or death of only 2.1% (95% CI, 0 to 5.0), whereas low sTILs (< 30%; 52%) had an unfavorable prognosis with a 15-year cumulative incidence of a distant metastasis or death of 38.4% (32.1 to 44.6). In addition, every 10% increment of sTILs decreased the risk of death by 19% (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.81; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.87), which are an independent predictor adding prognostic information to standard clinicopathologic variables (χ2 = 46.7, P < .001). CONCLUSION Chemotherapy-naïve, young patients with N0 TNBC with high sTILs (≥ 75%) have an excellent long-term prognosis. Therefore, sTILs should be considered for prospective clinical trials investigating (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy de-escalation strategies. Young cancer patients with TNBC and high sTILs have an excellent outcome, even without systemic treatment"

Surgery is always not available due to the dissemination of metastatic foci and most drugs are powerless because of poor retention at metastatic sites. TNBC cells generate an inflamed microenvironment and overexpress adhesive molecules to promote invasion and colonization. Herein, “walking dead” TNBC cells are developed through conjugating anti‐PD‐1 (programmed death protein 1 inhibitor) and doxorubicin (DOX)‐loaded liposomes onto cell corpses for temporal chemo‐immunotherapy against lung metastasis. The walking dead TNBC cells maintain plenary tumor antigens to conduct vaccination effects. Anti‐PD‐1 antibodies are conjugated to cell corpses via reduction‐activated linker, and DOX‐loaded liposomes are attached by maleimide–thiol coupling. This anchor strategy enables rapid release of anti‐PD‐1 upon reduction conditions while long‐lasting release of DOX at inflamed metastatic sites. The walking dead TNBC cells improve pulmonary accumulation and local retention of drugs, reprogram the lung microenvironment through damage‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and PD‐1 blockade, and prolong overall survival of lung metastatic 4T1 and EMT6‐bearing mice. Taking advantage of the walking dead TNBC cells for pulmonary preferred delivery of chemotherapeutics and checkpoint inhibitors, this study suggests an alternative treatment option of chemo‐immunotherapy to augment the efficacy against lung metastasis."

Although breast cancer is traditionally considered a ‘cold’ tumor type, TNBC is the most appropriate subtype for immunotherapeutic strategies; this is due to the high level of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, PD-L1 expression, and tumor mutational burden compared to other breast cancer subtypes. Areas covered This review examines the available evidence on the use of immunotherapeutic strategies in early and advanced TNBC, discusses the pitfalls and limitations often encountered in clinical research, and summarizes data on novel promising immunomodulatory approaches that have been explored in early-phase trials. Expert opinion PD-1-blockade is approved for stage II/III TNBC and for first-line treatment of PD-L1-positive TNBC patients with metastatic disease and should be considered standard of care. However, question marks and difficulties remain; these include the identification of predictive biomarkers to select patients who benefit from the addition of PD1-blockade and the balance between efficacy and long-term toxicity for an individual patient. Numerous treatment combinations and new immunotherapeutic strategies beyond PD1 blockade are being evaluated, thus reflecting a promising evolution towards a more personalized approach, and extended clinical benefit in TNBC.

Ferroptosis, a new form of cell death, is a candidate treatment for TNBC owing to its effectiveness in killing cancer cells. However, some TNBC cells exhibit an abnormal tumor metabolism, especially the ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1)‐mediated ubiquinone redox metabolism, which can promote ferroptosis resistance. Here, rosuvastatin (RSV) is encapsulated in silk fibroin (SF) nanoparticle (designated as Cu‐SF(RSV) NPs) for TNBC inhibition by overcoming FSP1‐mediated ferroptosis resistance. RSV intervenes in metabolic mevalonate pathway to disturb the redox homeostasis regulated by CoQ/FSP1 axis, thereby overcoming ferroptosis resistance. Besides, Cu‐SF(RSV) NPs can generate reactive oxygen species and deplete glutathione to facilitate redox stress, thereby amplifying ferroptosis effect. Thus, it is anticipated that the metabolic intervention nanoparticles, Cu‐SF(RSV) NPs, can be exploited as a promising therapeutic platform for clinical TNBC treatment."

Its unique immune microenvironment, including high expression of vascular endothelial growth factors, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and other molecules that promote the growth and migration of tumor cells, has been shown to play a dual role in the occurrence, growth, and metastasis of TNBC. Understanding the TNBC microenvironment is of great significance for the prognosis and treatment of TNBC. In this article, we describe the composition and function of immune cells in the TNBC microenvironment and summarize the major cytokine growth factors and chemokines in the TNBC microenvironment. Finally, we discuss the progress of TNBC, cytokine-induced killer cell therapy, and immune checkpoint therapy."

Stromal heterogeneity in human triple‐negative breast cancers (TNBCs) remains poorly understood, limiting the development of stromal‐targeted therapies. Single‐cell RNA sequencing of five TNBCs revealed two cancer‐associated fibroblast (CAF) and two perivascular‐like (PVL) subpopulations. CAFs clustered into two states: the first with features of myofibroblasts and the second characterised by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules. PVL cells clustered into two states consistent with a differentiated and immature phenotype. We showed that these stromal states have distinct morphologies, spatial relationships and functional properties in regulating the extracellular matrix. Using cell signalling predictions, we provide evidence that stromal‐immune crosstalk acts via a diverse array of immunoregulatory molecules. Importantly, the investigation of gene signatures from inflammatory‐CAFs and differentiated‐PVL cells in independent TNBC patient cohorts revealed strong associations with cytotoxic T‐cell dysfunction and exclusion, respectively. Such insights present promising candidates to further investigate for new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of TNBCs."

Here, we sought to dissect the mechanisms underlying PARP inhibitor-induced changes in the tumor microenvironment of BRCA1-deficient triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We demonstrate that the PARP inhibitor olaparib induces CD8+ T-cell infiltration and activation in vivo, and that CD8+ T-cell depletion severely compromises antitumor efficacy. Olaparib-induced T-cell recruitment is mediated through activation of the cGAS/STING pathway in tumor cells with paracrine activation of dendritic cells and is more pronounced in HR-deficient compared with HR-proficient TNBC cells and in vivo models. CRISPR-mediated knockout of STING in cancer cells prevents proinflammatory signaling and is sufficient to abolish olaparib-induced T-cell infiltration in vivo. These findings elucidate an additional mechanism of action of PARP inhibitors and provide a rationale for combining PARP inhibition with immunotherapies for the treatment of TNBC. SIGNIFICANCE: This work demonstrates cross-talk between PARP inhibition and the tumor microenvironment related to STING/TBK1/IRF3 pathway activation in cancer cells that governs CD8+ T-cell recruitment and antitumor efficacy. The data provide insight into the mechanism of action of PARP inhibitors in BRCA-associated breast cancer.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 681."

TNBC cells do not express the well-known estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expressed by other breast cancer subtypes. This phenomenon leaves no room for novel treatment approaches including endocrine and HER2-specific antibody therapies. To date, surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy remain the principal therapy options for TNBC treatment. However, in numerous cases, these approaches either result in minimal clinical benefit or are nonfunctional, resulting in disease recurrence and poor prognosis. Nowadays, chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy is becoming more established as an option for the treatment of various types of hematologic malignancies. CAR-Ts are genetically engineered T lymphocytes that employ the body’s immune system mechanisms to selectively recognize cancer cells expressing tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) of interest and efficiently eliminate them. However, despite the clinical triumph of CAR-T therapy in hematologic neoplasms, CAR-T therapy of solid tumors, including TNBC, has been much more challenging. In this review, we will discuss the success of CAR-T therapy in hematological neoplasms and its caveats in solid tumors, and then we summarize the potential CAR-T targetable TAAs in TNBC studied in different investigational stages."

Emerging evidence suggested that some chemotherapeutic drugs played anti-tumor effects by inducing cell pyroptosis. Nevertheless, whether pyroptosis contributes to the DDP-induced anti-tumor effect in TNBC remains unexploited. In the present study, NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD pyroptosis pathway was involved in the DDP-induced anti-tumor effect of TNBC in vitro and in vivo, providing evidence that DDP might induce pyroptosis in TNBC. Moreover, DDP activated NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD pyroptosis pathway by up-regulating the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3). Furthermore, knockdown of MEG3 not only partly abolished the activation effect of DDP on NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD pathway-mediated pyroptosis, but also reversed the suppression of DDP on tumor growth and metastasis ability in vitro and in vivo, further confirming that MEG3 may partially mediate the pyroptotic signaling upon DDP treatment. Thus, our data uncovered a novel mechanism that DDP induced pyroptosis via activation of MEG3/NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD pathway in TNBC to exert anti-tumor effects, which may help to develop new strategies for the therapeutic interventions in TNBC."

Patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma frequently develop resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy, at which time treatment options become limited.


Objective
To evaluate the poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor niraparib combined with pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma.


Design, Setting, and Participants
The TOPACIO/KEYNOTE-162 (Niraparib in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Patients With Triple-Negative Breast Cancer or Ovarian Cancer) trial, an open-label, single-arm phases 1 and 2 study enrolled women with advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) or recurrent ovarian carcinoma, irrespective of BRCA mutation status. Median follow-up was 12.4 months (range, 1.2 to ≥23.0 months). Data were collected from April 15, 2016, through September 4, 2018, with September 4, 2018, as a data cutoff, and analyzed from September 4, 2018, through January 30, 2019.


Interventions
The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) was 200 mg of oral niraparib once daily and 200 mg of intravenous pembrolizumab on day 1 of each 21-day cycle.


Main Outcomes and Measures
The primary objectives of phase 1 were to evaluate dose-limiting toxic effects and establish the RP2D and dosing schedule. The primary objective of phase 2 was to assess objective response rate (ORR; complete plus partial responses). Results from the phase 1 ovarian carcinoma and TNBC cohorts and phase 2 ovarian carcinoma cohort are reported. Because of the similarity in the phase 1 and 2 ovarian carcinoma populations, the data were pooled to perform an integrated efficacy analysis.


Results
Fourteen patients (9 with ovarian carcinoma and 5 with TNBC) in phase 1 and 53 patients with ovarian carcinoma in phase 2 were enrolled, for a pooled ovarian carcinoma cohort of 62 patients (median age, 60 years [range, 46-83 years]). In the integrated efficacy phases 1 and 2 ovarian carcinoma population (60 of 62 evaluable patients), ORR was 18% (90% CI, 11%-29%), with a disease control rate of 65% (90% CI, 54%-75%), including 3 (5%) with confirmed complete responses, 8 (13%) with confirmed partial responses, 28 (47%) with stable disease, and 20 (33%) with progressive disease. The ORRs were consistent across subgroups based on platinum-based chemotherapy sensitivity, previous bevacizumab treatment, or tumor BRCA or homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) biomarker status. Median duration of response was not reached (range, 4.2 to ≥14.5 months). At data cutoff, 2 patients with a response and 1 patient with stable disease continued to receive treatment.


Conclusions and Relevance
Niraparib in combination with pembrolizumab is tolerable, with promising antitumor activity for patients with ovarian carcinoma who have limited treatment options regardless of platinum status, biomarker status, or prior treatment with bevacizumab. Responses in patients without tumor BRCA mutations or non-HRD cancers were higher than expected with either agent as monotherapy.

Among its subtypes, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has the worst prognosis. With the increasing number of diagnosed TNBC patients, the urgent need of novel biomarkers is also rising. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) has recently emerged as a key regulator associated with ferroptosis and cuproptosis (FAC) and has exhibited a significant effect on BRCA, but its detailed mechanism remains elusive. Herein, we conducted the first converge comprehensive landscape analysis of FAC-related gene CDKN2A in BRCA and disclosed its prognostic value in BRCA. Then, an unsupervised cluster analysis based on CDKN2A-correlated genes unveiled three subtypes, namely cold-immune subtype, IFN-γ activated subtype and FTL-dominant subtype. Subsequent analyses depicting hallmarks of tumor microenvironment (TME) among three subtypes suggested strong association between TNBC and CDKN2A. Given the fact that the most clinically heterogeneous TNBC always displayed the most severe outcomes and lacked relevant drug targets, we further explored the potential of immunotherapy for TNBC by interfering CDKN2A and constructed the CDKN2A-derived prognostic model for TNBC patients by Lasso-Cox. The 21-gene–based prognostic model showed high accuracy and was verified in external independent validation cohort. Moreover, we proposed three drugs for TNBC patients based on our model via targeting epidermal growth factor receptor. In summary, our study indicated the potential of CDKN2A as a pioneering prognostic predictor for TNBC and provided a rationale of immunotherapy for TNBC, and offered fresh perspectives and orientations for cancer treatment via inducing ferroptosis and cuproptosis to develop novel anti-cancer treatment strategies."

Methods: In vitro and in vivo models were employed to determine the pathological function of YTHDC1 in TNBC metastasis. To identify bona fide YTHDC1 target RNAs, we conducted RNA-seq, m6A-seq, and RIP-seq, followed by integrative data analysis and validation assays. Results: By analyzing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, we found that elevated expression of YTHDC1 is positively correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Using a mammary fat pad mouse model of TNBC, YTHDC1 significantly promoted lung metastasis of TNBC cells. Through multiple transcriptome-wide sequencing and integrative data analysis, we revealed dysregulation of metastasis-related pathways following YTHDC1 depletion and identified SMAD3 as a bona fide YTHDC1 target RNA. Depletion of YTHDC1 caused nuclear retention of SMAD3 mRNA, leading to lower SMAD3 protein levels. Loss of YTHDC1 led to impaired TGF-β-induced gene expression, leading to inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and suppressed TNBC cell migration and invasion. SMAD3 overexpression was able to restore the response to TGF-β in YTHDC1 depleted TNBC cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the oncogenic role of YTHDC1 is mediated through its recognition of m6A as m6A-binding defective mutants of YTHDC1 were unable to rescue the impaired cell migration and invasion of YTHDC1 knockout TNBC cells. Conclusions: We show that YTHDC1 plays a critical oncogenic role in TNBC metastasis through promoting the nuclear export and expression of SMAD3 to augment the TGF-β signaling cascade. Overall, our study demonstrates that YTHDC1 is vital for TNBC progression by enhancing TNBC cell survival and TGF-β-mediated EMT via SMAD3 to enable the formation of distant metastasis and highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting the YTHDC1/m6A/SMAD3 axis for TNBC treatment."

It is the subtype of breast cancers with the highest metastatic potential and recurrence at the first 5 years after diagnosis. In addition, mortality increases when a complete pathological response is not achieved. As TNBC cells lack estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors, patients do not respond well to hormone and anti-HER2 therapies, and conventional chemotherapy remains the standard treatment. Despite efforts to develop targeted therapies, this disease continues to have a high unmet medical need, and there is an urgent demand for customized diagnosis and therapeutics. As immunotherapy is changing the paradigm of anticancer treatment, it arises as an alternative treatment for TNBC patients. TNBC is classified as an immunogenic subtype of breast cancer due to its high levels of tumor mutational burden and presence of immune cell infiltrates. This review addresses the implications of these characteristics for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of the disease. Herein, the role of immune gene signatures and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes as biomarkers in TNBC is reviewed, identifying their application in patient diagnosis and stratification, as well as predictors of efficacy. The expression of PD-L1 expression is already considered to be predictive of response to checkpoint inhibitor therapy, but the challenges regarding its value as biomarker are described. Moreover, the rationales for different formats of immunotherapy against TNBC currently under clinical research are discussed, and major clinical trials are highlighted. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated clinical benefit, particularly in early-stage tumors and when administered in combination with chemotherapy, with several regimens approved by the regulatory authorities. The success of antibody–drug conjugates and research on other emerging approaches, such as vaccines and cell therapies, will also be addressed. These advances give hope on the development of personalized, more effective, and safe treatments, which will improve the survival and quality of life of patients with TNBC."

Three principal characteristics of TNBC cells are (i) extreme aggressiveness, (ii) absence of hormones, and (iii) growth factor receptors. Due to the lack or poor expression of the estrogen receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and progesterone receptor, TNBC is resistant to hormones and endocrine therapies. Consequently, chemotherapy is currently used as the primary approach against TNBC. Expression of androgen receptor (AR) in carcinoma cells has been observed in a subset of patients with TNBC; therefore, inhibiting androgen signaling pathways holds promise for TNBC targeting. The new AR inhibitors have opened up new therapy possibilities for BC patients carrying AR-positive TNBC cells. Our group provides a comprehensive review of the structure and function of the AR and clinical evidence for targeting the cell’s nuclear receptor in TNBC. We updated AR agonists, inhibitors, and antagonists. We also presented a new era of genetic manipulating CRISPR/Cas9 and nanotechnology as state-of-the-art approaches against AR to promote the efficiency of targeted therapy in TNBC. Significance Statement The lack of effective treatment for triple-negative breast cancer is a health challenge. The main disadvantages of existing treatments are their side effects, due to their nonspecific targeting. Molecular targeting of cellular receptors, such as androgen receptors, increased expression in malignant tissues, significantly improving the survival rate of breast cancer patients."

Breast cancer is a complex, heterogeneous disease classified into hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 overexpressing (HER2+) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) based on histological features. Endocrine therapy, the mainstay of treatment for hormone-responsive breast cancer involves use of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), selective estrogen receptor downregulators (SERDs) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs). Agents that target estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2 such as tamoxifen and trastuzumab have been the most extensively used therapeutics for breast cancer. Crosstalk between ER and other signalling networks as well as epigenetic mechanisms have been envisaged to contribute to endocrine therapy resistance. TNBC, a complex, heterogeneous, aggressive form of breast cancer in which the cells do not express ER, progesterone receptor or HER2 is refractory to therapy. Several molecular targets are being explored to target TNBC including androgen receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Receptors, protein tyrosine kinases, phosphatases, proteases, PI3K/Akt signalling pathway, microRNAs (miRs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are potential therapeutic targets. miR-based therapeutic approaches include inhibition of oncomiRs by antisense oligonucleotides, restoration of tumour suppressors using miR mimics, and chemical modification of miRs. The lnRNAs HOTAIR, SPRY4-IT1, GAS5, and PANDAR, new players in tumour development and prognosis may have theranostic applications in breast cancer. Several novel classes of mechanism-based drugs have been designed and synthesised for treatment of breast cancer. Integration of nucleic acid sequencing studies with mass spectrometry-based peptide sequencing and posttranslational modifications as well as rational drug design will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology of breast cancer and help in evolving therapeutic strategies."

This phase II study evaluated the antitumor activity and safety of enzalutamide in patients with locally advanced or metastatic AR-positive TNBC. Patients and Methods Tumors were tested for AR with an immunohistochemistry assay optimized for breast cancer; nuclear AR staining > 0% was considered positive. Patients received enzalutamide 160 mg once per day until disease progression. The primary end point was clinical benefit rate (CBR) at 16 weeks. Secondary end points included CBR at 24 weeks, progression-free survival, and safety. End points were analyzed in all enrolled patients (the intent-to-treat [ITT] population) and in patients with one or more postbaseline assessment whose tumor expressed ≥ 10% nuclear AR (the evaluable subgroup). Results Of 118 patients enrolled, 78 were evaluable. CBR at 16 weeks was 25% (95% CI, 17% to 33%) in the ITT population and 33% (95% CI, 23% to 45%) in the evaluable subgroup. Median progression-free survival was 2.9 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 3.7 months) in the ITT population and 3.3 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 4.1 months) in the evaluable subgroup. Median overall survival was 12.7 months (95% CI, 8.5 months to not yet reached) in the ITT population and 17.6 months (95% CI, 11.6 months to not yet reached) in the evaluable subgroup. Fatigue was the only treatment-related grade 3 or higher adverse event with an incidence of > 2%. Conclusion Enzalutamide demonstrated clinical activity and was well tolerated in patients with advanced AR-positive TNBC. Adverse events related to enzalutamide were consistent with its known safety profile. This study supports additional development of enzalutamide in advanced TNBC."

In this context, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have emerged as a clinically relevant and highly reproducible biomarker capable of affecting BC prognosis and response to treatment. Indeed, the evaluation of TILs on primary tumors proved to be strongly prognostic in triple-negative (TN) BC patients treated with either adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as well as in early TNBC patients not receiving any systemic treatment, thus gaining level-1b evidence in this setting. In addition, a strong relationship between TILs and pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been reported in all BC subtypes and the prognostic role of higher TILs in early HER2-positive breast cancer patients has also been demonstrated. The interest in BC immune infiltrates has been further fueled by the introduction of the first immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment armamentarium of advanced TNBC in patients with PD-L1-positive status by FDA-approved assays. However, despite these advances, a biomarker capable of reliably and exhaustively predicting immunotherapy benefit in BC is still lacking, highlighting the imperative need to further deepen this issue. Finally, more comprehensive evaluation of immune infiltrates integrating both the quantity and quality of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and incorporation of TILs in composite scores encompassing other clinically or biologically relevant biomarkers, as well as the adoption of software-based and/or machine learning platforms for a more comprehensive characterization of BC immune infiltrates, are emerging as promising strategies potentially capable of optimizing patient selection and stratification in the research field. In the present review, we summarize available evidence and recent updates on immune infiltrates in BC, focusing on current clinical applications, potential clinical implications and major unresolved issues."

In this study, it was found that luminal and triple‐negative breast cancers require distinct therapeutic approaches because of their different amounts of autophagy flux. We identified that autophagy flux was inhibited in triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) CSCs. Moreover, miRNA‐181a (miR‐181a) expression is upregulated in both TNBC CSCs and patient tissues. Autophagy‐related 5 (ATG5) and autophagy‐related 2B (ATG2B) participate in the early formation of autophagosomes and were revealed as targets of miR‐181a. Inhibition of miR‐181a expression led to attenuation of TNBC stemness and an increase in autophagy flux. Furthermore, treatment with curcumin led to attenuation of cancer stemness in TNBC CSCs; the expression of ATG5 and ATG2B was enhanced and there was an increase of autophagy flux. These results indicated that ATG5 and ATG2B are involved in the suppression of cancer stemness in TNBC. In summary, autophagy inhibits cancer stemness through the miR‐181a‐regulated mechanism in TNBC. Promoting tumor‐suppressive autophagy using curcumin may be a potential method for the treatment of TNBC."

CircUBAP2 has been identified to promote the progression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), but the function of circUBAP2 in the cisplatin (DDP) resistance of TNBC remains obscure. Our investigation showed that circUBAP2 was significantly upregulated in DDP-resistant TNBC and TNBC sensitivity to DDP could be enhanced by silencing of circUBAP2. Moreover, circUBAP2 was revealed to be a ceRNA for miR-300 to upregulate the expression of anti-silencing function 1B histone chaperone (ASF1B). The effect of circUBAP2/miR-300/ASF1B axis on DDP resistance of TNBC was evaluated by rescue experiments, which demonstrated that circUBAP2 inhibited TNBC sensitivity to DDP through miR-300/ASF1B axis. Furthermore, it was discovered that ASF1B activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling to facilitate the DDP resistance of TNBC cells. In summary, this research revealed a novel regulatory mechanism that circUBAP2 functioned as ceRNA of miR-300 to upregulate ASF1B, which further triggered the PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PAM) signaling to enhance the DDP resistance of TNBC.

Poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitor and anti-programmed death receptor-1 inhibitor monotherapy have shown limited clinical activity in patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).


Objective
To evaluate the clinical activity (primary) and safety (secondary) of combination treatment with niraparib and pembrolizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic TNBC.


Design, Setting, and Participants
This open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study enrolled 55 eligible patients with advanced or metastatic TNBC irrespective of BRCA mutation status or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression at 34 US sites. Data were collected from January 3, 2017, through October 29, 2018, and analyzed from October 29, 2018, through February 27, 2019.


Interventions
Patients were administered 200 mg of oral niraparib once daily in combination with 200 mg of intravenous pembrolizumab on day 1 of each 21-day cycle.


Main Outcomes and Measures
The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. Secondary end points were safety, disease control rate (DCR; complete response plus partial response plus stable disease), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival.


Results
Within the full study population of 55 women (median age, 54 years [range, 32-90 years]), 5 patients had confirmed complete responses, 5 had confirmed partial responses, 13 had stable disease, and 24 had progressive disease. In the efficacy-evaluable population (n = 47), ORR included 10 patients (21%; 90% CI, 12%-33%) and DCR included 23 (49%; 90% CI, 36%-62%). Median DOR was not reached at the time of the data cutoff, with 7 patients still receiving treatment at the time of analysis. In 15 evaluable patients with tumor BRCA mutations, ORR included 7 patients(47%; 90% CI, 24%-70%), DCR included 12 (80%; 90% CI, 56%-94%), and median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI, 2.1 months to not estimable). In 27 evaluable patients with BRCA wild-type tumors, ORR included 3 patients (11%; 90% CI, 3%-26%), DCR included 9 (33%; 90% CI, 19%-51%), and median PFS was 2.1 months (95% CI, 1.4-2.5 months). The most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were anemia (10 [18%]), thrombocytopenia (8 [15%]), and fatigue (4 [7%]). Immune-related adverse events were reported in 8 patients (15%) and were grade 3 in 2 patients (4%); no new safety signals were detected.


Conclusions and Relevance
Combination niraparib plus pembrolizumab provides promising antitumor activity in patients with advanced or metastatic TNBC, with numerically higher response rates in those with tumor BRCA mutations. The combination therapy was safe with a tolerable safety profile, warranting further investigation.

There is an absence of specific treatment strategies for this tumor subgroup, and hence TNBC is managed with conventional therapeutics, often leading to systemic relapse. In terms of histology and transcription profile these cancers have similarities to BRCA-1-linked breast cancers, and it is hypothesized that BRCA1 pathway is non-functional in this type of breast cancer. In this review article, we discuss the different receptors expressed by TNBC as well as the diversity of different signaling pathways targeted by TNBC therapeutics, for example, Notch, Hedgehog, Wnt/b-Catenin as well as TGF-beta signaling pathways. Additionally, many epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors effectively inhibit the TNBCs, but they face challenges of either resistance to drugs or relapse. The resistance of TNBC to conventional therapeutic agents has helped in the advancement of advanced TNBC therapeutic approaches including hyperthermia, photodynamic therapy, as well as nanomedicine-based targeted therapeutics of drugs, miRNA, siRNA, and aptamers, which will also be discussed. Artificial intelligence is another tool that is presented to enhance the diagnosis of TNBC."

TNBC accounts for about 15% of breast cancer cases in the U.S., and is known for high relapse rates and poor overall survival (OS). Chemo-resistant TNBC is a genetically diverse, highly heterogeneous, and rapidly evolving disease that challenges our ability to individualize treatment for incomplete responders and relapsed patients. Currently, the frontline standard chemotherapy, composed of anthracyclines, alkylating agents, and taxanes, is commonly used to treat high-risk and locally advanced TNBC. Several FDA-approved drugs that target programmed cell death protein-1 (Keytruda) and programmed death ligand-1 (Tecentriq), poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), and/or antibody drug conjugates (Trodelvy) have shown promise in improving clinical outcomes for a subset of TNBC. These inhibitors that target key genetic mutations and specific molecular signaling pathways that drive malignant tumor growth have been used as single agents and/or in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens. Here, we review the current TNBC treatment options, unmet clinical needs, and actionable drug targets, including epidermal growth factor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and protein kinase B (PKB or AKT) activation in TNBC. Supported by strong evidence in developmental, evolutionary, and cancer biology, we propose that the K-RAS/SIAH pathway activation is a major tumor driver, and SIAH is a new drug target, a therapy-responsive prognostic biomarker, and a major tumor vulnerability in TNBC. Since persistent K-RAS/SIAH/EGFR pathway activation endows TNBC tumor cells with chemo-resistance, aggressive dissemination, and early relapse, we hope to design an anti-SIAH-centered anti-K-RAS/EGFR targeted therapy as a novel therapeutic strategy to control and eradicate incurable TNBC in the future."

A significant proportion of patients with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Sequencing of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) after surgery, along with enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), may be used to detect minimal residual disease and assess which patients may experience disease recurrence.


Objective
To determine whether the presence of ctDNA and CTCs after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early-stage TNBC is independently associated with recurrence and clinical outcomes.


Design, Setting, and Participants
A preplanned secondary analysis was conducted from March 26, 2014, to December 18, 2018, using data from 196 female patients in BRE12-158, a phase 2 multicenter randomized clinical trial that randomized patients with early-stage TNBC who had residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy to receive postneoadjuvant genomically directed therapy vs treatment of physician choice. Patients had blood samples collected for ctDNA and CTCs at time of treatment assignment; ctDNA analysis with survival was performed for 142 patients, and CTC analysis with survival was performed for 123 patients. Median clinical follow-up was 17.2 months (range, 0.3-58.3 months).


Interventions
Circulating tumor DNA was sequenced using the FoundationACT or FoundationOneLiquid Assay, and CTCs were enumerated using an epithelial cell adhesion molecule-based, positive-selection microfluidic device.


Main Outcomes and Measures
Primary outcomes were distant disease-free survival (DDFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS).


Results
Among 196 female patients (mean [SD] age, 49.6 [11.1] years), detection of ctDNA was significantly associated with inferior DDFS (median DDFS, 32.5 months vs not reached; hazard ratio [HR], 2.99; 95% CI, 1.38-6.48; P = .006). At 24 months, DDFS probability was 56% for ctDNA-positive patients compared with 81% for ctDNA-negative patients. Detection of ctDNA was similarly associated with inferior DFS (HR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.28-5.57; P = .009) and inferior OS (HR, 4.16; 95% CI,1.66-10.42; P = .002). The combination of ctDNA and CTCs provided additional information for increased sensitivity and discriminatory capacity. Patients who were ctDNA positive and CTC positive had significantly inferior DDFS compared with those who were ctDNA negative and CTC negative (median DDFS, 32.5 months vs not reached; HR, 5.29; 95% CI, 1.50-18.62; P = .009). At 24 months, DDFS probability was 52% for patients who were ctDNA positive and CTC positive compared with 89% for those who were ctDNA negative and CTC negative. Similar trends were observed for DFS (HR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.07-9.27; P = .04) and OS (HR, 8.60; 95% CI, 1.78-41.47; P = .007).


Conclusions and Relevance
In this preplanned secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, detection of ctDNA and CTCs in patients with early-stage TNBC after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was independently associated with disease recurrence, which represents an important stratification factor for future postneoadjuvant trials.

We recently generated conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) as efficient photosensitizers for the photo-eradication of different cancer cells. With the aim of improving the selectivity of PDT with CPNs, the nanoparticle surface conjugation with unique 2’-Fluoropyrimidines-RNA-aptamers that act as effective recognition elements for functional surface signatures of TNBC cells was proposed and designed. A coupling reaction with carbodiimide was used to covalently bind NH2-modified aptamers with CPNs synthetized with two polystyrene-based polymer donors of COOH groups for the amide reaction. The selectivity of recognition for TNBC membrane receptors and PDT efficacy were assayed in TNBC cells and compared with non-TNBC cells by flow cytometry and cell viability assays. Furthermore, in vitro PDT efficacy was assayed in different TNBC cells with significant improvement results using CL4, sTN29 and sTN58 aptamers compared to unconjugated CPNs and SCR non-specific aptamer. In a chemoresistance TNBC cell model, sTN58 was the candidate for improving labelling and PDT efficacy with CPNs. We proposed sTN58, sTN29 and CL4 aptamers as valuable tools for selective TNBC targeting, cell internalization and therapeutic improvements for CPNs in PDT protocols."

Ginsenoside CK (CK) can effectively inhibit triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the occurrence and development of which are associated with glutamine addiction. However, the connection between CK and glutamine metabolism in TNBC proliferation and the mechanism of cell death induction remains unclear. Here, we found that high glutamine-addicted TNBC cells were particularly sensitive to CK treatment. CK exerted antitumour activity against TNBC by suppressing glutamine consumption and glutamate production via downregulation of glutaminase 1 (GLS1) expression. CK treatment further decreased cellular ATP production, reduced the utilisation of amino acids associated with glutamine metabolism, and induced glutathione (GSH) depletion and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, consequently triggering apoptosis in TNBC. Furthermore, CK decreased GLS1 expression in SUM159 xenograft mouse mammary tumours and significantly inhibited tumour growth with few side effects. Together, our data provide a powerful theoretical basis for the application of CK as a glutamine metabolic inhibitor in TNBC treatment."
Addiction of Cancer Stem Cells to MUC1-C in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Progression,"[{'authorId': '4288683', 'name': 'N. Yamashita'}, {'authorId': '40408720', 'name': 'D. Kufe'}]",25,2022,02c936d091cabace703370aa3dfd07fde3ace66a,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive malignancy with limited treatment options. TNBC progression is associated with expansion of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Few insights are available regarding druggable targets that drive the TNBC CSC state. This review summarizes the literature on TNBC CSCs and the compelling evidence that they are addicted to the MUC1-C transmembrane protein. In normal epithelia, MUC1-C is activated by loss of homeostasis and induces reversible wound-healing responses of inflammation and repair. However, in settings of chronic inflammation, MUC1-C promotes carcinogenesis. MUC1-C induces EMT, epigenetic reprogramming and chromatin remodeling in TNBC CSCs, which are dependent on MUC1-C for self-renewal and tumorigenicity. MUC1-C-induced lineage plasticity in TNBC CSCs confers DNA damage resistance and immune evasion by chronic activation of inflammatory pathways and global changes in chromatin architecture. Of therapeutic significance, an antibody generated against the MUC1-C extracellular domain has been advanced in a clinical trial of anti-MUC1-C CAR T cells and in IND-enabling studies for development as an antibody–drug conjugate (ADC). Agents targeting the MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain have also entered the clinic and are undergoing further development as candidates for advancing TNBC treatment. Eliminating TNBC CSCs will be necessary for curing this recalcitrant cancer and MUC1-C represents a promising druggable target for achieving that goal."

Whether BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation status affects treatment outcome remains elusive. Objective To determine whether BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation status affects therapy response in patients with TNBC. Design, Setting, and Participants This secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial used archived DNA samples and cancer family history of 315 patients with TNBC enrolled between August 1, 2011, and December 31, 2012, in the GeparSixto trial. In all, 291 participants (92.4%) were included in this multicenter prospective investigation. DNA samples were analyzed for germline mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, and 16 other cancer predisposition genes. The pCR rates between the carboplatin and noncarboplatin arms were compared. Genetic analyses were performed at the Center for Familial Breast and Ovarian Cancer in Cologne, Germany; data analysis, November 1 through December 31, 2015. Main Outcomes and Measures Proportion of patients who achieved pCR and disease-free survival after neoadjuvant treatment according to BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation status. For pCR rates, the ypT0/is ypN0 definition was used as a primary end point. Results Of the 291 patients with TNBC, all were women; the mean (SD) age was 48 (11) years. The pCR rate in the carboplatin group was 56.8% (83 of 146) and 41.4% (60 of 145) in the noncarboplatin group (odds ratio [OR], 1.87; 95% CI, 1.17-2.97; P = .009). Pathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations were present in 50 of the 291 patients (17.2%). In the noncarboplatin arm, the pCR rate was 66.7% (16 of 24) for patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and 36.4% (44 of 121) for patients without (OR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.39-8.84; P = .008). The high pCR rate observed in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers (16 of 24 [66.7%]) was not increased further by adding carboplatin (17 of 26 [65.4%]). In contrast, carboplatin increased response rates in patients without BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations: 66 of the 120 patients (55%) without BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations achieved pCR in the carboplatin arm vs 44 of the 121 patients (36.4%) in the noncarboplatin arm (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.28-3.58; P = .004). Patients without pathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 alterations showed elevated disease-free survival rates when carboplatin was added (without carboplatin, 73.5%; 95% CI, 64.1%-80.8% vs with carboplatin, 85.3%; 95% CI, 77.0%-90.8%; hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29-0.96; P = .04). Conclusions and Relevance Under the nonstandard GeparSixto polychemotherapy regimen, patients without BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations benefited from the addition of carboplatin and those with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations showed superior response rates without additive effects observed for carboplatin.

To achieve tumor-targeting, a drug delivery system would have to incorporate ligands that specifically bind to receptors expressed on cancer cells to function as portals via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Cell-targeting and internalizing aptamers are the most suitable ligands for functionalization of drug-loaded nanocarriers. Here, we designed a novel aptamer-based platform for the active delivery of siRNA targeting programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. The generated nanovectors consist of PLGA-based polymeric nanoparticles, which were loaded with PD-L1 siRNA and conjugated on their surface with a new RNA aptamer, specific for TNBC and resistant to nucleases. In vitro results demonstrated that these aptamer-conjugated nanoparticles promote siRNA uptake specifically into TNBC MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 target cells, along with its endosomal release, without recognizing non-TNBC BT-474 breast cancer cells. Their efficiency resulted in an almost complete suppression of PD-L1 expression as early as 90 min of cell treatment. This research provides a rational strategy for optimizing siRNA delivery systems for TNBC treatments."

TNBC is a term derived from tumors that are characterized by the absence of ER, PgR, and HER2. So patients with TNBC do not benefit from hormonal or trastuzumab-based therapies. TNBCs are biologically aggressive, although some reports suggest that they respond to chemotherapy better than other types of breast cancer, prognosis remains poor. This is due to: shortened disease-free interval in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting and a more aggressive course in the metastatic setting."

The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway is frequently activated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The AKT inhibitor capivasertib has shown preclinical activity in TNBC models, and drug sensitivity has been associated with activation of PI3K or AKT and/or deletions of PTEN. The PAKT trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adding capivasertib to paclitaxel as first-line therapy for TNBC.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase II trial recruited women with untreated metastatic TNBC. A total of 140 patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to paclitaxel 90 mg/m2 (days 1, 8, 15) with either capivasertib (400 mg twice daily) or placebo (days 2-5, 9-12, 16-19) every 28 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), PFS and OS in the subgroup with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN alterations, tumor response, and safety.


RESULTS
Median PFS was 5.9 months with capivasertib plus paclitaxel and 4.2 months with placebo plus paclitaxel (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.08; 1-sided P = .06 [predefined significance level, 1-sided P = .10]). Median OS was 19.1 months with capivasertib plus paclitaxel and 12.6 months with placebo plus paclitaxel (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.99; 2-sided P = .04). In patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered tumors (n = 28), median PFS was 9.3 months with capivasertib plus paclitaxel and 3.7 months with placebo plus paclitaxel (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.79; 2-sided P = .01). The most common grade ≥ 3 adverse events in those treated with capivasertib plus paclitaxel versus placebo plus paclitaxel, respectively, were diarrhea (13% v 1%), infection (4% v 1%), neutropenia (3% v 3%), rash (4% v 0%), and fatigue (4% v 0%).


CONCLUSION
Addition of the AKT inhibitor capivasertib to first-line paclitaxel therapy for TNBC resulted in significantly longer PFS and OS. Benefits were more pronounced in patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered tumors. Capivasertib warrants further investigation for treatment of TNBC."

As a DNA cross-linking agent, cisplatin may be effective treatment for hereditary BRCA1-mutated breast cancers. Because sporadic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and BRCA1-associated breast cancer share features suggesting common pathogenesis, we conducted a neoadjuvant trial of cisplatin in TNBC and explored specific biomarkers to identify predictors of response. PATIENTS AND METHODS Twenty-eight women with stage II or III breast cancers lacking estrogen and progesterone receptors and HER2/Neu (TNBC) were enrolled and treated with four cycles of cisplatin at 75 mg/m(2) every 21 days. After definitive surgery, patients received standard adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy per their treating physicians. Clinical and pathologic treatment response were assessed, and pretreatment tumor samples were evaluated for selected biomarkers. Results Six (22%) of 28 patients achieved pathologic complete responses, including both patients with BRCA1 germline mutations;18 (64%) patients had a clinical complete or partial response. Fourteen (50%) patients showed good pathologic responses (Miller-Payne score of 3, 4, or 5), 10 had minor responses (Miller-Payne score of 1 or 2), and four (14%) progressed. All TNBCs clustered with reference basal-like tumors by hierarchical clustering. Factors associated with good cisplatin response include young age (P = .001), low BRCA1 mRNA expression (P = .03), BRCA1 promoter methylation (P = .04), p53 nonsense or frameshift mutations (P = .01), and a gene expression signature of E2F3 activation (P = .03). CONCLUSION Single-agent cisplatin induced response in a subset of patients with TNBC. Decreased BRCA1 expression may identify subsets of TNBCs that are cisplatin sensitive. Other biomarkers show promise in predicting cisplatin response."

These cancers represent a heterogeneous breast cancer subtype with a poor prognosis. Few systemic treatment options exist besides the use of chemotherapy (CT). The heterogeneity of the disease has limited the successful development of targeted therapy in unselected patient populations. Currently, there are no approved targeted therapies for TNBC. However, intense research is ongoing to identify specific targets and develop additional and better systemic treatment options. Standard adjuvant and neoadjuvant regimens include anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, and taxanes. Platinum-based CT has been proposed as another CT option of interest in TNBC. We review the role of this therapy in general, and particularly in patients carrying BRCA germ-line mutations. Available data concerning the role of platinum-based CT in TNBC were acquired primarily in the neoadjuvant setting. The routine use of platinum-based CT is not yet recommended by available guidelines. Many studies have reported the molecular characterization of TNBCs. Several actionable targets have been identified. Novel therapeutic strategies are currently being tested in clinical trials based on promising results observed in preclinical studies. These targets include androgen receptor, EGFR, PARP, FGFR, and the angiogenic pathway. We review the recent data on experimental drugs in this field. We also discuss the recent data concerning immunologic checkpoint inhibitors."

To our knowledge, there is no consensus regarding differences in treatment and mortality between non-Hispanic African American and non-Hispanic White women with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Little is known about whether racial disparities vary by sociodemographic, clinical, and neighborhood factors.


Objective
To examine the differences in clinical treatment and outcomes between African American and White women in a nationally representative cohort of patients with TNBC and further examine the contributions of sociodemographic, clinical, and neighborhood factors to TNBC outcome disparities.


Design, Setting, and Participants
This population-based, retrospective cohort study included 23 123 women who received a diagnosis of nonmetastatic TNBC between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015, followed up through December 31, 2016, and identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data set. The study was conducted from July 2019 to November 2020. The analyses were performed from July 2019 to June 2020.


Exposures
Race and ethnicity, including non-Hispanic African American and non-Hispanic White race.


Main Outcomes and Measures
Using logistic regression analysis and competing risk regression analysis, we estimated odds ratios (ORs) of receipt of treatment and hazard ratios (HRs) of breast cancer mortality in African American patients compared with White patients.


Results
Of 23 213 participants, 5881 (25.3%) were African American women and 17 332 (74.7%) were White women. Compared with White patients, African American patients had lower odds of receiving surgery (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.60-0.79) and chemotherapy (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81-0.99) after adjustment for sociodemographic, clinicopathologic, and county-level factors. During a 43-month follow-up, 3276 patients (14.2%) died of breast cancer. The HR of breast cancer mortality was 1.28 (95% CI, 1.18-1.38) for African American individuals after adjustment for sociodemographic and county-level factors. Further adjustment for clinicopathological and treatment factors reduced the HR to 1.16 (95% CI, 1.06-1.25). This association was observed in patients living in socioeconomically less deprived counties (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.14-1.39), urban patients (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.11-1.32), patients having stage II (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.02-1.39) or III (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01-1.31) tumors that were treated with chemotherapy, and patients younger than 65 years (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.12-1.37).


Conclusions and Relevance
In this retrospective cohort study, African American women with nonmetastatic TNBC had a significantly higher risk of breast cancer mortality compared with their White counterparts, which was partially explained by their disparities in receipt of surgery and chemotherapy."

Viruses team up with cancer immunotherapy Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown great promise for cancer therapy, but they do not treat all cancers, and neither breast nor brain tumors are usually treatable with these drugs. However, Bourgeois-Daigneault et al. discovered a way to address this for breast cancer, and Samson et al. discovered a way to address this for brain tumors. In both cases, the authors found that oncolytic virus treatment given early, before surgical resection, alters the antitumor immune response and potentiates the effects of subsequent treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although these studies differ in the details of their methods and the immune effects induced by the oncolytic viruses, they indicate the potential of such viruses for enhancing the potential of checkpoint therapy and expanding it to new types of cancer. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive disease for which treatment options are limited and associated with severe toxicities. Immunotherapeutic approaches like immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a potential strategy, but clinical trials have demonstrated limited success in this patient cohort. Clinical studies using ICIs have revealed that patients with preexisting anticancer immunity are the most responsive. Given that oncolytic viruses (OVs) induce antitumor immunity, we investigated their use as an ICI-sensitizing approach. Using a therapeutic model that mimics the course of treatment for women with newly diagnosed TNBC, we demonstrate that early OV treatment coupled with surgical resection provides long-term benefits. OV therapy sensitizes otherwise refractory TNBC to immune checkpoint blockade, preventing relapse in most of the treated animals. We suggest that OV therapy in combination with immune checkpoint blockade warrants testing as a neoadjuvant treatment option in the window of opportunity between TNBC diagnosis and surgical resection."

Although patients initially respond to the treatment, the cancer often comes back and kills the patient. Recent studies have demonstrated that cancer cells express genes that protect them from killing by immune cells, but the stimulus that prompts this response is unknown. We show that when TNBC cells are treated with chemotherapy, the surviving cells turn on genes that enable them to escape killing by the immune system. We identify hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), which are known to promote metastasis of TNBC, as responsible for this countertherapeutic effect. We show that coadministration of an HIF inhibitor with chemotherapy blocks the ability of surviving TNBC cells to evade the immune system. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy and is often characterized by early relapse and metastasis. To form a secondary (recurrent and/or metastatic) tumor, a breast cancer cell must evade the innate and adaptive immune systems. CD47 enables cancer cells to evade killing by macrophages, whereas CD73 and PDL1 mediate independent mechanisms of evasion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Here, we report that treatment of human or murine TNBC cells with carboplatin, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, or paclitaxel induces the coordinate transcriptional induction of CD47, CD73, and PDL1 mRNA and protein expression, leading to a marked increase in the percentage of CD47+CD73+PDL1+ breast cancer cells. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) blocked chemotherapy-induced enrichment of CD47+CD73+PDL1+ TNBC cells, which were also enriched in the absence of chemotherapy by incubation under hypoxic conditions, leading to T cell anergy or death. Treatment of mice with cytotoxic chemotherapy markedly increased the intratumoral ratio of regulatory/effector T cells, an effect that was abrogated by HIF inhibition. Our results delineate an HIF-dependent transcriptional mechanism contributing to TNBC progression and suggest that combining chemotherapy with an HIF inhibitor may prevent countertherapeutic induction of proteins that mediate evasion of innate and adaptive antitumor immunity."

Preclinical models support the use of platinum agents in the TNBC basal subtype. The EA1131 trial hypothesized that invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) would not be inferior but improved in patients with basal subtype TNBC treated with adjuvant platinum compared with capecitabine. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with clinical stage II or III TNBC with ≥ 1 cm RD in the breast post-NAC were randomly assigned to receive platinum (carboplatin or cisplatin) once every 3 weeks for four cycles or capecitabine 14 out of 21 days every 3 weeks for six cycles. TNBC subtype (basal v nonbasal) was determined by PAM50 in the residual disease. A noninferiority design with superiority alternative was chosen, assuming a 4-year iDFS of 67% with capecitabine. RESULTS Four hundred ten of planned 775 participants were randomly assigned to platinum or capecitabine between 2015 and 2021. After median follow-up of 20 months and 120 iDFS events (61% of full information) in the 308 (78%) patients with basal subtype TNBC, the 3-year iDFS for platinum was 42% (95% CI, 30 to 53) versus 49% (95% CI, 39 to 59) for capecitabine. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were more common with platinum agents. The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee recommended stopping the trial as it was unlikely that further follow-up would show noninferiority or superiority of platinum. CONCLUSION Platinum agents do not improve outcomes in patients with basal subtype TNBC RD post-NAC and are associated with more severe toxicity when compared with capecitabine. Participants had a lower than expected 3-year iDFS regardless of study treatment, highlighting the need for better therapies in this high-risk population."

Triple-negative breast cancer: epidemiological considerations and recommendations.,"[{'authorId': '2099802689', 'name': 'P. Boyle'}]",547,2012,f5968a212990f3b2e7920b5247f00c55e3814a66,"Breast cancer is a major problem for global public health. Breast Cancer is the most common incident form of cancer in women around the world. The incidence is increasing while mortality is declining in many high-income countries. The last decade has seen a revolution in the understanding of breast cancer, with new classifications proposed that have significant prognostic value and provide guides to treatment options. Breast cancers that demonstrate the absence of oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor and no overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) are referred to as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). There is now evidence emerging from epidemiological studies regarding important characteristics of this group of tumours that carry a relatively poorer prognosis than the major breast cancer sub-types. From this review of available data and information, there are some consistent findings that emerge. Women with TNBC experience the peak risk of recurrence within 3 years of diagnosis, and the mortality rates appear to be increased for 5 years after diagnosis. TNBC represents 10%-20% of invasive breast cancers and has been associated with African-American race, deprivation status, younger age at diagnosis, more advanced disease stage, higher grade, high mitotic indices, family history of breast cancer and BRCA1 mutations. TNBC is regularly reported to be three times more common in women of African descent and in pre-menopausal women, and carries a poorer prognosis than other forms of breast cancer. Although prospects for prevention of non-hormone-dependent breast cancer are currently poor, it is still important to understand the aetiology of such tumours. There remains a great deal of work to be done to arrive at a comprehensive picture of the aetiology of breast cancer. Key recommendations are that there is a clear and urgent need to have more epidemiological studies of the breast cancer sub-types to integrate aetiological and lifestyle factors for prevention of incidence and death, and to have more population-based information of the clinical and biological relevance from cancer registries."

Exploring novel approaches for the treatment of these subtypes is critical, especially because the median survival for women with metastatic TNBC is less than 12 months, and virtually all women with metastatic TNBC ultimately will die of their disease despite systemic therapy. To date, not a single targeted therapy has been approved for the treatment of TNBC, and cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the standard treatment.

There are currently no effective therapies against metastatic TNBC. Compared with other breast cancer subtypes, EGFR is frequently overexpressed in TNBC and a potential therapeutic target for this disease. There are two types of EGFR inhibitors, small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and monoclonal antibody (mAb), for the treatment of cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. For breast cancer, however, the clinical trials of EGFR inhibitors have failed due to low response rates. Because a small portion of patients do demonstrate response to EGFR inhibitors, it may be necessary to stratify patients to enhance the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors in TNBC and to develop the effective combination therapy for this patient population. In this review, we describe some of the molecular mechanisms underlying EGFR inhibitor sensitivity and further discuss the possible therapeutic strategies to increase the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors in TNBC."

It is classified into a few major molecular subtypes according to hormone and growth factor receptor expression. Over the past few years, substantial advances have been made in the discovery of new drugs for treating BC. Improved understanding of the biologic heterogeneity of BC has allowed the development of more effective and individualized approach to treatment. In this review, we provide an update about the current treatment strategy and discuss the various emerging novel therapies for the major molecular subtypes of BC. A brief account of the clinical development of inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, histone deacetylation, multi-targeting tyrosine kinases, and immune checkpoints for personalized treatment of BC is included. However, no targeted drug has been approved for the most aggressive subtype—triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Thus, we discuss the heterogeneity of TNBC and how molecular subtyping of TNBC may help drug discovery for this deadly disease. The emergence of drug resistance also poses threat to the successful development of targeted therapy in various molecular subtypes of BC. New clinical trials should incorporate advanced methods to identify changes induced by drug treatment, which may be associated with the upregulation of compensatory signaling pathways in drug resistant cancer cells."

Neoadjuvant therapy has focused on combinations of systemic agents to optimise pathological complete response. Treatment algorithms now guide the management of patients with or without residual disease, but metastatic TNBC continues to harbour a poor prognosis. Innovative, multi-drug combination systemic therapies in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings have led to significant improvements in outcomes, particularly over the past decade. Recently published advances in the treatment of metastatic TNBC have shown impressive results with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and immunotherapy agents. Immunotherapy agents in combination with traditional systemic chemotherapy have been shown to alter the natural history of this devastating condition, particularly in patients whose tumours are positive for programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)."

A winning combination A phase 1/2 clinical trial tested an inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NMMA) combined with taxane in patients with chemorefractory, locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) and metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The overall response rate was 45.8% (11 of 24): 81.8% (9 of 11) for patients with LABC and 15.4% (2 of 13) for patients with metastatic TNBC. Among the patients with LABC, three patients had a pathological complete response at surgery (27.3%). There was remodeling of the immune environment in the tumors of responders that correlated with lower arginase expression. This L-NMMA and taxane chemotherapy combination warrants further investigation in larger clinical studies of patients with breast cancer. The inducible nitric oxide signaling (iNOS) pathway is associated with poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Prior studies using in vivo models showed that inhibition of the iNOS signaling pathway using the pan-NOS inhibitor NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (L-NMMA) reduced tumor growth and enhanced survival in patients with TNBC. Here, we report a first-in-class phase 1/2 trial of L-NMMA combined with taxane for treating patients with chemorefractory, locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) or metastatic TNBC. We also examined immune cell correlates of chemotherapy response. 35 patients with metastatic TNBC were recruited: 15 in the phase 1 trial and 24 in the phase 2 trial (including 4 recommended phase 2 dose patients from the phase 1 trial). The overall response rate was 45.8% (11 of 24): 81.8% (9 of 11) for patients with LABC and 15.4% (2 of 13) for patients with metastatic TNBC. Among the patients with LABC, three patients had a pathological complete response at surgery (27.3%). Grade ≥3 toxicity was noted in 21% of patients; however, no adverse events were attributed to L-NMMA. Immune cells analyzed by CyTOF indicated that chemotherapy nonresponders showed greater expression of markers associated with M2 macrophage polarization and increased concentrations of circulating IL-6 and IL-10 cytokines. In contrast, chemotherapy responders showed an increase in CD15+ neutrophils in blood, as well as a decrease in arginase (a marker of protumor N2 neutrophils) in tumor biopsies obtained at the end of treatment. L-NMMA combined with taxane warrants further investigation in larger clinical studies of patients with breast cancer."

Validated prognostic and predictive biomarkers are needed to guide treatment decisions and prognostication. Areas covered: In this review, we discuss established and developing prognostic and predictive biomarkers in TNBC and associated emerging and approved therapies. Biomarkers reviewed include epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), androgen receptor, NOTCH signaling, oxidative stress/redox signaling, microRNAs, TP53 mutation, breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 or 2 (BRCA1/2) mutation/homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), NTRK gene fusion, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, immune biomarkers (programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), tumor mutational burden (TMB), neoantigens, defects in DNA mismatch repair proteins (dMMR)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)), circulating tumor cells/cell-free DNA, novel targets of antibody-drug conjugates, and residual disease. Expert opinion: Biomarker-driven care in the management of TNBC is increasing and has helped expand options for patients diagnosed with this subtype of breast cancer. Research efforts are ongoing to identify additional biomarkers and targeted treatment options with the ultimate goal of improving clinical outcomes and survivorship."

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) induces a pathologic complete response (pCR) in approximately 30% of patients with triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). In patients lacking a pCR, NAC selects a subpopulation of chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells. To understand the molecular underpinnings driving treatment-resistant TNBCs, we performed comprehensive molecular analyses on the residual disease of 74 clinically defined TNBCs after NAC, including next-generation sequencing (NGS) on 20 matched pretreatment biopsies. Combined NGS and digital RNA expression analysis identified diverse molecular lesions and pathway activation in drug-resistant tumor cells. Ninety percent of the tumors contained a genetic alteration potentially treatable with a currently available targeted therapy. Thus, profiling residual TNBCs after NAC identifies targetable molecular lesions in the chemotherapy-resistant component of the tumor, which may mirror micrometastases destined to recur clinically. These data can guide biomarker-driven adjuvant studies targeting these micrometastases to improve the outcome of patients with TNBC who do not respond completely to NAC.


SIGNIFICANCE
This study demonstrates the spectrum of genomic alterations present in residual TNBC after NAC. Because TNBCs that do not achieve a CR after NAC are likely to recur as metastatic disease at variable times after surgery, these alterations may guide the selection of targeted therapies immediately after mastectomy before these metastases become evident."

Immunotherapy brings hope and opportunity to solve this challenge, while its clinical applications are greatly inhibited by the tumor immunosuppressive environment. Here, an intelligent biomimetic nanoplatform was designed based on dendritic large-pore mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DLMSNs) for suppressing metastatic TNBC by combining photothermal ablation and immune remodeling. Taking advantage of the ordered large-pore structure and easily chemically modified property of DLMSNs, the copper sulfide (CuS) nanoparticles with high photothermal conversion efficiency were in situ deposited inside the large pores of DLMSNs, and the immune adjuvant resiquimod (R848) was loaded controllably. A homogenous cancer cell membrane was coated on the surfaces of these DLMSNs, followed by conjugation with the anti-PD-1 peptide AUNP-12 through a polyethylene glycol linker with an acid-labile benzoic-imine bond. The thus-obtained AM@DLMSN@CuS/R848 was applied to holistically treat metastatic TNBC in vitro and in vivo. The data showed that AM@DLMSN@CuS/R848 had a high TNBC-targeting ability and induced efficient photothermal ablation on primary TNBC tumors under 980 nm laser irradiation. Tumor antigens thus generated and increasingly released R848 by response to the photothermal effect, combined with AUNP-12 detached from AM@DLMSN@CuS/R848 in the weakly acidic tumor microenvironment, synergistically exerted tumor vaccination, and T lymphocyte activation functions on immune remodeling to prevent TNBC recurrence and metastasis. Taken together, this study provides an intelligent biomimetic nanoplatform to enhance therapeutic outcomes in metastatic TNBC."

We report a novel tumor suppressor role for BNip3 in a clinically relevant mouse model of mammary tumorigenesis. BNip3 delays primary mammary tumor growth and progression by preventing the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and resultant excess ROS production. In the absence of BNip3, mammary tumor cells are unable to reduce mitochondrial mass effectively and elevated mitochondrial ROS increases the expression of Hif‐1α and Hif target genes, including those involved in glycolysis and angiogenesis—two processes that are also markedly increased in BNip3‐null tumors. Glycolysis inhibition attenuates the growth of BNip3‐null tumor cells, revealing an increased dependence on autophagy for survival. We also demonstrate that BNIP3 deletion can be used as a prognostic marker of tumor progression to metastasis in human triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC). These studies show that mitochondrial dysfunction—caused by defects in mitophagy—can promote the Warburg effect and tumor progression, and suggest better approaches to stratifying TNBC for treatment."

However, lack of molecular targeted therapies and poor prognosis of TNBC patients have prompted a great effort to discover effective targets for improving the clinical outcomes. For now, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi’s) and immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of TNBC. Moreover, agents that target signal transduction, angiogenesis, epigenetic modifications, and cell cycle are under active preclinical or clinical investigations.

Preliminary clinical trials exploring interruption of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling showed benefit in several cancer types. We analyzed the distribution of PD-1–positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and cancer cells' expression of PD-L1 in a molecularly profiled cohort of 437 malignancies (380 carcinomas, 33 sarcomas, and 24 melanomas). We showed that the presence of PD-1+ TILs significantly varied among cancer types (from 0% in extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas to 93% in ovarian cancer), and was generally associated with the increased number of mutations in tumor cells (P = 0.029). Cancer cell expression of PD-L1 varied from absent (in Merkel cell carcinomas) to 100% (in chondro- and liposarcomas), but showed the inverse association with the number of detected mutations (P = 0.004). Both PD-1 and PD-L1 expression were significantly higher in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) than in non-TNBC (P < 0.001 and 0.017, respectively). Similarly, MSI-H colon cancers had higher PD-1 and PD-L1 expression than the microsatellite stable tumors (P = 0.002 and 0.02, respectively). TP53-mutated breast cancers had significantly higher PD-1 positivity than those harboring other driver mutations (e.g., PIK3CA; P = 0.002). In non–small cell lung cancer, PD-1/PD-L1 coexpression was identified in 8 cases (19%), which lacked any other targetable alterations (e.g., EGFR, ALK, or ROS1).

Preclinical studies demonstrated that antiangiogenic therapy could sensitize breast cancer to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade via reprogramming tumor microenvironment. Combinational treatment of checkpoint blockade and antiangiogenesis for TNBC has not been reported. Methods Patients with advanced TNBC with less than three lines of systemic therapy were enrolled in an open-label, non-comparative, two-arm, phase II trial at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital. Camrelizumab (intravenously every 2 weeks) with apatinib orally at either continuous dosing (d1–d14) or intermittent dosing (d1–d7) was given until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities. Primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Results From January 2018 to April 2019, 40 patients were enrolled, including 10 in the apatinib intermittent dosing cohort and 30 in the apatinib continuous dosing cohort. The ORR was 43.3% (13 of 30) in the continuous dosing cohort, while no objective response was observed in the intermittent dosing cohort. The disease control rate was 63.3% (19 of 30) in the apatinib continuous dosing cohort, and 40.0% (4 of 10) in the apatinib intermittent dosing cohort, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.7 (95% CI 2.0 to 6.4) months and 1.9 (95% CI 1.8 to 3.7) months in the continuous dosing and intermittent dosing cohort, respectively. In the continuous dosing cohort, the median PFS of patients with partial response (8.3 months, 95% CI 5.9 to not reached) was significantly longer than that of patients with stable disease/progressive disease/not evaluable (2.0 months, 95% CI 1.7 to 3.0). The most common adverse events (AEs) included elevated aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase and hand-foot syndrome. Overall, 26.7% and 20.0% of patients experienced grade ≥3 AEs in the continuous dosing and intermittent dosing cohort, respectively. In the continuous dosing cohort, a high percentage of baseline tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (>10%) was associated with higher ORR and favorable PFS (p=0.029, 0.054, respectively). Conclusions The ORR by this chemo-free regimen was dramatically higher than previously reported ORR by anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody or apatinib monotherapy.

In this study, when analyzing the influence of m6A modulators (METTL3, METTL14, WTAP, FTO, and ALKBH5) on the prognosis of breast cancer, especially in TNBC using several on-line databases, methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) was found to have low expression in breast cancer, and was closely associated with short-distance-metastasis-free survival in TNBC. Further investigation showed that knockdown of METTL3 could enhance the ability of migration, invasion, and adhesion by decreasing m6A level in TNBC cell lines. Collagen type III alpha 1 chain (COL3A1) was identified and verified as a target gene of METTL3. METTL3 could down-regulate the expression of COL3A1 by increasing its m6A methylation, ultimately inhibiting the metastasis of TNBC cells.

One factor limiting responsiveness of TNBCs to ICIs is a lack of functional tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in ‘non-inflamed’ or ‘cold’ tumor immune microenvironments (TIMEs), although by unknown mechanisms. Targeting MUC1-C in a mouse transgenic TNBC tumor model increases cytotoxic tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells (CTLs), supporting a role for MUC1-C in immune evasion. The basis for these findings and whether they extend to human TNBCs are not known. Methods Human TNBC cells silenced for MUC1-C using short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were analyzed for the effects of MUC1-C on global transcriptional profiles. Differential expression and rank order analysis was used for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Gene expression was confirmed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR and immunoblotting. The The Cancer Genome Atlas Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA-BRCA) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) datasets were analyzed for effects of MUC1 on GSEA, cell-type enrichment, and tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion. Single-cell scRNA-seq datasets of TNBC samples were analyzed for normalized expression associations between MUC1 and selected genes within tumor cells. Results Our results demonstrate that MUC1-C is a master regulator of the TNBC transcriptome and that MUC1-C-induced gene expression is driven by STAT1 and IRF1. We found that MUC1-C activates the inflammatory interferon (IFN)-γ-driven JAK1→STAT1→IRF1 pathway and induces the IDO1 and COX2/PTGS2 effectors, which play key roles in immunosuppression. Involvement of MUC1-C in activating the immunosuppressive IFN-γ pathway was extended by analysis of human bulk and scRNA-seq datasets. We further demonstrate that MUC1 associates with the depletion and dysfunction of CD8+ T cells in the TNBC TIME. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that MUC1-C integrates activation of the immunosuppressive IFN-γ pathway with depletion of TILs in the TNBC TIME and provide support for MUC1-C as a potential target for improving TNBC treatment alone and in combination with ICIs. Of translational significance, MUC1-C is a druggable target with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and a functional inhibitor that are under clinical development."

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by the lack of expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. It is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer and accounts for 12–20% of all breast cancer cases. TNBC is associated with younger age of onset, greater metastatic potential, higher incidence of relapse, and lower overall survival rates. Based on molecular phenotype, TNBC has been classified into six subtypes (BL1, BL2, M, MES, LAR, and IM). TNBC treatment is challenging due to its heterogeneity, highly invasive nature, and relatively poor therapeutics response. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are conventional strategies for the treatment of TNBC. Recent research in TNBC and mechanistic understanding of disease pathogenesis using cutting-edge technologies has led to the unfolding of new lines of therapies that have been incorporated into clinical practice. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and immune checkpoint inhibitors have made their way to the current TNBC treatment paradigm. This review focuses on the classification, features, and treatment progress in TNBC. Histological subtypes connected to recurrence, molecular classification of TNBC, targeted therapy for early and advanced TNBC, and advances in non-coding RNA in therapy are the key highlights in this review."

Based on clinical benefit in randomized trials, ICIs in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of some patients with advanced/metastatic TNBC have been approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA), expanding options for patients. Ongoing questions remain, however, about the optimal chemotherapy backbone for immunotherapy, appropriate biomarker-based selection of patients for treatment, the optimal strategy for immunotherapy treatment in earlier stage disease, and potential use in histological subtypes other than TNBC. To provide guidance to the oncology community on these and other important concerns, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts to develop a clinical practice guideline (CPG). The expert panel drew upon the published literature as well as their clinical experience to develop recommendations for healthcare professionals on these important aspects of immunotherapeutic treatment for breast cancer, including diagnostic testing, treatment planning, immune-related adverse events (irAEs), and patient quality of life (QOL) considerations.

The development of strategies by targeting tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to stimulate their ability of Programmed Cell Removal (PrCR) provides a promising new immunotherapy for TNBC treatment. Methods CD47 is a critical self-protective “don’t eat me” signal on multiple human cancers against macrophage immunosurveillance. Using human and mouse TNBC preclinical models, we evaluated the efficacy of PrCR-based immunotherapy by blocking CD47. We performed high-throughput screens on FDA-approved anti-cancer small molecule compounds for agents potentiating PrCR and enhancing the efficacy of CD47-targeted therapy for TNBC treatment. Results We showed that CD47 was widely expressed on TNBC cells and TAMs represented the most abundant immune cell population in TNBC tumors. Blockade of CD47 enabled PrCR of TNBC cells, but the efficacy was not satisfactory. Our high-throughput screens identified cabazitaxel in enhancing PrCR-based immunotherapy. A combination of CD47 blockade and cabazitaxel treatment yielded a highly effective treatment strategy, promoting PrCR of TNBC cells and inhibiting tumor development and metastasis in preclinical models. We demonstrated that cabazitaxel potentiated PrCR by activating macrophages, independent of its cytotoxicity toward cancer cells. When treated with cabazitaxel, the molecular and phenotypic signatures of macrophages were polarized toward M1 state, and the NF-kB signaling pathway became activated. Conclusion The combination of CD47 blockade and macrophage activation by cabazitaxel synergizes to vastly enhance the elimination of TNBC cells. Our results show that targeting macrophages is a promising and effective strategy for TNBC treatment."

Tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) heterogeneity has a profound impact on the immunotherapy response. Tumors with non-inflamed TIME derive limited benefit from immunotherapy. However, what drives the formation of the non-inflamed TIME in TNBC remains unclear. Methods Using our multiomics database of TNBC, we conducted an analysis to explore the key genomic events driving the formation of the non-inflamed TIME in TNBC. In vitro and in vivo studies further revealed potential mechanisms and the efficacy of combination treatment with immunotherapy. Results With transcriptomic and genomic data, we systematically analyzed the TIME of TNBC and revealed that the classical basal-like subtype of TNBC consisted of two distinct microenvironment phenotypes, defined as the ‘inflamed’ and ‘non-inflamed’ subtypes. We performed further screening and demonstrated that MYC amplification and overexpression led to low immune infiltration and cytolytic activity in TIME. Mechanistically, MYC bound to DNMT1 promoter and activated DNMT1 transcription in TNBC cells, thus suppressing the Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-STING pathway via an epigenetic regulatory way. In MYC-overexpressing TNBC, decitabine, an Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, converted tumors from non-inflamed to inflamed tumors by enhancing T cell infiltration. Furthermore, the combination of decitabine with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor reversed T cell exhaustion and improved T cell function in mouse models, which elicited potent antitumor activity in MYC-overexpressing TNBC. Conclusions Our work elucidates that the classic oncogene MYC induces immune evasion by repressing innate immunity. Furthermore, we provide a rationale for combining DNA methyltransferase inhibition with immunotherapy for the treatment of MYC-overexpressing TNBC."

Although its prevalence among newly diagnosed breast cancers is approximately 12.7%, it accounts for 40% of breast cancer-related mortality. Higher mortality rates among TNBC is partly because of the lack of targeted therapies and the development of resistance to chemotherapy. We discuss several important mechanisms that lead to chemoresistance and focus on important pathways and biological features that can be potentially exploited to develop therapies for TNBC. TNBC is currently defined by the absence of ER, PR, and Her2 and the greatest leap for TNBC would be our ability to characterize them with the presence of ‘x’ proteins. With this review, we intend to highlight the key nodes of TNBC and push the field towards connecting the dots between key features of TNBC and novel drug(s). Abstract Metastatic progression and tumor recurrence pertaining to TNBC are certainly the leading cause of breast cancer-related mortality; however, the mechanisms underlying TNBC chemoresistance, metastasis, and tumor relapse remain somewhat ambiguous. TNBCs show 77% of the overall 4-year survival rate compared to other breast cancer subtypes (82.7 to 92.5%). TNBC is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, with chemotherapy being the major approved treatment strategy. Activation of ABC transporters and DNA damage response genes alongside an enrichment of cancer stem cells and metabolic reprogramming upon chemotherapy contribute to the selection of chemoresistant cells, majorly responsible for the failure of anti-chemotherapeutic regime. These selected chemoresistant cells further lead to distant metastasis and tumor relapse. The present review discusses the approved standard of care and targetable molecular mechanisms in chemoresistance and provides a comprehensive update regarding the recent advances in TNBC management."

In this study, inspired by the enriched innate immune cell type tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in TNBC, we proposed a matrix metalloprotease 2 (MMP2) responsive integrated immunochemotherapeutic strategy to deliver paclitaxel (PTX) and anti-CD47 (aCD47) by detachable immune liposomes (ILips). In the TNBC microenvironment, the ""two-in-one"" ILips facilitated MMP2-responsive release of aCD47 to efficiently polarize M2 macrophages toward the M1 phenotype to enhance phagocytosis against tumor cells and activate the systemic T cell immune response. Together with the immune effect, the detached PTX-loaded liposomes were internalized in MDA-MB-231 cells to synergistically inhibit tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. In the TNBC-bearing mouse model, PTX-loaded ILips demonstrated superior antitumor efficacy against TNBC and inhibited tumor recurrence. Our integrated strategy represents a promising approach to synchronously enhance immune response and tumor-killing effects, improving the therapeutic efficacy against TNBC."

MicroRNA (miRNA)-155-5p is upregulated in TNBC cells; thus, the present study explored whether the downregulation of miR-155-5p enhanced the anti-tumor effect of cetuximab in TNBC cells. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were infected with lentivirus-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) for 72 h to obtain EGFR-overexpressed cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468). The inhibitory effects of cetuximab on the proliferation and migration of EGFR-overexpressed MDA-MB-468 cells were enhanced following transfection with the miR-155-5p antagomir, and miR-155-5p knockdown enhanced the pro-apoptotic effect of cetuximab on EGFR-overexpressed MDA-MB-468 cells. Further, the luciferase reporter assay revealed that gasdermin E (GSDME) was the direct binding target of miR-155-5p. The combination of cetuximab with the miR-155-5p antagomir promoted pyroptosis in EGFR-overexpressed MDA-MB-468 cells via the upregulation of GSDME-N and cleaved caspase-1. Results from the in vivo experiments confirmed that the downregulation of miR-155-5p enhanced the anti-tumor effect of cetuximab in an MDA-MB-468 xenograft model and on EGFR-overexpressed TNBC cells via inducing cell apoptosis and pyroptosis. Therefore, cetuximab combination with an miR-155-5p antagomir may be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of TNBC."

While genomic and phenotypic intra-tumor heterogeneity are pervasive features of TNBCs at the time of diagnosis, the functional contributions of heterogeneous tumor cell populations to chemoresistance have not been elucidated. To investigate tumor evolution accompanying NACT, we employed orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of treatment-naive TNBC, which retain intra-tumor heterogeneity characteristic of human TNBC. We discovered that some PDX models initially exhibited partial sensitivity to standard front-line NACT (Adriamycin plus Cytoxan, AC). Following AC, residual tumors were resistant to chemotherapy but repopulated tumors with chemo-sensitive cells if left untreated, indicating that tumor cells possessed inherent plasticity. To identify the tumor cell subpopulation(s) conferring chemoresistance, we conducted barcode-mediated clonal tracking in three independent PDX models by introducing a high-complexity pooled lentiviral barcode library into PDX tumor cells which were then orthotopically engrafted into recipient mice. Strikingly, residual tumors maintained the same heterogeneous clonal architecture as naive tumors. Concordantly, whole-exome sequencing revealed conservation of genomic subclonal architecture throughout treatment. These results were corroborated by genomic sequencing of serial biopsies pre- and post-AC obtained directly from TNBC patients enrolled on an ongoing clinical trial at MD Anderson (ARTEMIS; NCT02276443). Together, these studies revealed that genomically distinct pre-treatment subclones were equally capable of surviving AC to reconstitute tumors after treatment. To identify functional addictions of residual tumor cells, we conducted histologic and transcriptomic profiling. Residual tumors following AC-treatment exhibited extensive fibrotic desmoplasia and tumor cell pleomorphism in both PDX models and in serial biopsies obtained from TNBC patients enrolled on the ARTEMIS trial. Strikingly, these AC-induced features were reverted upon regrowth of residual tumors in PDXs and in patients9 tumors. Similarly, residual tumors exhibited unique transcriptomic features, many of which are also de-regulated in cohorts of human TNBCs undergoing chemotherapy treatment. These features were nearly completely reverted after tumors regrew, suggesting that the residual tumor state may be a unique and transient therapeutic window. Gene set enrichment analyses revealed that residual tumors had increased activation of oxidative phosphorylation and decreased glycolytic signaling. Pharmacologic targeting of oxidative phosphorylation with a small-molecule inhibitor of mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I (IACS-010759) significantly delayed the regrowth of AC-treated residual tumors in three independent PDX models. Collectively, these studies reveal that a reversible phenotypic state can confer chemoresistance in the absence of genomic selection and that the residual tumor state is a novel therapeutic window for chemo-refractory TNBC.

PARP inhibitors are active in tumors with defects in DNA homologous recombination (HR) due to BRCA1/2 mutations. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway preserves HR steady state. We hypothesized that in BRCA-proficient triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), PI3K inhibition would result in HR impairment and subsequent sensitization to PARP inhibitors. We show in TNBC cells that PI3K inhibition leads to DNA damage, downregulation of BRCA1/2, gain in poly-ADP-ribosylation, and subsequent sensitization to PARP inhibition. In TNBC patient-derived primary tumor xenografts, dual PI3K and PARP inhibition with BKM120 and olaparib reduced the growth of tumors displaying BRCA1/2 downregulation following PI3K inhibition. PI3K-mediated BRCA downregulation was accompanied by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. Overexpression of an active form of MEK1 resulted in ERK activation and downregulation of BRCA1, whereas the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 increased BRCA1/2 expression and reversed the effects of MEK1. We subsequently identified that the ETS1 transcription factor was involved in the ERK-dependent BRCA1/2 downregulation and that knockdown of ETS1 led to increased BRCA1/2 expression, limiting the sensitivity to combined BKM120 and olaparib in 3-dimensional culture.


SIGNIFICANCE
Treatment options are limited for patients with TNBCs. PARP inhibitors have clinical activity restricted to a small subgroup of patients with BRCA mutations. Here, we show that PI3K blockade results in HR impairment and sensitization to PARP inhibition in TNBCs without BRCA mutations, providing a rationale to combine PI3K and PARP inhibitors in this indication. Our findings could greatly expand the number of patients with breast cancer that would benefit from therapy with PARP inhibitors. On the basis of our findings, a clinical trial with BKM120 and olaparib is being initiated in patients with TNBCs."

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been directly linked to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy. Here we report that ROS induced either by chemotherapy (paclitaxel) or antioxidant depletion induce PD-L1 expression in macrophages. PD-L1 positive macrophages have immune-suppressive and angiogenic properties that interfere with the efficacy of paclitaxel in vivo. Indeed, PD-L1 blockade reverts this effect and synergizes with paclitaxel to reduce tumor growth. Our work reveals a pathway that further supports the importance of combining taxane and PD-L1 inhibitors as promising anticancer strategy in TNBC. The combination of immune checkpoint blockade with chemotherapy is currently under investigation as a promising strategy for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most prominent component of the breast cancer microenvironment because they influence tumor progression and the response to therapies. Here we show that macrophages acquire an immunosuppressive phenotype and increase the expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) when treated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) inducers such as the glutathione synthesis inhibitor, buthionine sulphoximine (BSO), and paclitaxel. Mechanistically, these agents cause accumulation of ROS that in turn activate NF-κB signaling to promote PD-L1 transcription and the release of immunosuppressive chemokines. Systemic in vivo administration of paclitaxel promotes PD-L1 accumulation on the surface of TAMS in a mouse model of TNBC, consistent with in vitro results. Combinatorial treatment with paclitaxel and an anti-mouse PD-L1 blocking antibody significantly improved the therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel by reducing tumor burden and increasing the number of tumor-associated cytotoxic T cells. Our results provide a strong rationale for the use of anti–PD-L1 blockade in the treatment of TNBC patients. Furthermore, interrogation of chemotherapy-induced PD-L1 expression in TAMs is warranted to define appropriate patient selection in the use of PD-L1 blockade."

DNA repair competency is one determinant of sensitivity to certain chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin. Cancer cells with intact DNA repair can avoid the accumulation of genome damage during growth and also can repair platinum-induced DNA damage. We sought genomic signatures indicative of defective DNA repair in cell lines and tumors and correlated these signatures to platinum sensitivity. The number of subchromosomal regions with allelic imbalance extending to the telomere (N(tAI)) predicted cisplatin sensitivity in vitro and pathologic response to preoperative cisplatin treatment in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In serous ovarian cancer treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, higher levels of N(tAI) forecast a better initial response. We found an inverse relationship between BRCA1 expression and N(tAI) in sporadic TNBC and serous ovarian cancers without BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Thus, accumulation of telomeric allelic imbalance is a marker of platinum sensitivity and suggests impaired DNA repair.


SIGNIFICANCE
Mutations in BRCA genes cause defects in DNA repair that predict sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, including platinum; however, some patients without BRCA mutations also benefit from these agents. NtAI, a genomic measure of unfaithfully repaired DNA, may identify cancer patients likely to benefit from treatments targeting defective DNA repair."

However, little is known regarding their tumor microenvironment (TME) heterogeneity. Methods Here, we investigated TME heterogeneity within each TNBC molecular subtype, including immune infiltrate localization and composition together with expression of targetable immune pathways, using publicly available transcriptomic and genomic datasets from a large TNBC series totaling 1512 samples. Associations between molecular subtypes and specific features were assessed using logistic regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results We demonstrated that each TNBC molecular subtype exhibits distinct TME profiles associated with specific immune, vascularization, stroma, and metabolism biological processes together with specific immune composition and localization. The immunomodulatory subtype was associated with the highest expression of adaptive immune-related gene signatures and a fully inflamed spatial pattern appearing to be the optimal candidate for immune check point inhibitors. In contrast, most mesenchymal stem-like and luminal androgen receptor tumors showed an immunosuppressive phenotype as witnessed by high expression levels of stromal signatures. Basal-like, luminal androgen receptor, and mesenchymal subtypes exhibited an immune cold phenotype associated with stromal and metabolism TME signatures and enriched in margin-restricted spatial pattern. Tumors with high chromosomal instability and copy number loss in the chromosome 5q and 15q regions, including genomic loss of major histocompatibility complex related genes, showed reduced cytotoxic activity as a plausible immune escape mechanism. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that each TNBC subtype is associated with specific TME profiles, setting the ground for a rationale tailoring of immunotherapy in TNBC patients."

TME plays a crucial role in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) immunomodulation and tumor progression, paradoxically, acting as an immunosuppressive as well as immunoreactive factor. Research regarding tumor immune microenvironment has contributed to a better understanding of TNBC subtype classification. Shall we treat patients precisely according to specific subtype classification? Moving beyond traditional chemotherapy, multiple clinical trials have recently implied the potential benefits of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy. In this review, we aimed to elucidate the paradoxical role of TME in TNBC immunomodulation, summarize the subtype classification methods for TNBC, and explore the synergistic mechanism of chemotherapy plus immunotherapy. Our study may provide a new direction for the development of combined treatment strategies for TNBC. Abstract Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease and is highly related to immunomodulation. As we know, the most effective approach to treat TNBC so far is still chemotherapy. Chemotherapy can induce immunogenic cell death, release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling; therefore, it will be interesting to investigate the relationship between chemotherapy-induced TME changes and TNBC immunomodulation. In this review, we focus on the immunosuppressive and immunoreactive role of TME in TNBC immunomodulation and the contribution of TME constituents to TNBC subtype classification. Further, we also discuss the role of chemotherapy-induced TME remodeling in modulating TNBC immune response and tumor progression with emphasis on DAMPs-associated molecules including high mobility group box1 (HMGB1), exosomes, and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1), which may provide us with new clues to explore effective combined treatment options for TNBC."

: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 15% of all breast cancers and is associated with poor long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. Because of the lack of approved targeted therapy, at present chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for early and advanced disease. TNBC is enriched for germline BRCA mutation, providing a foundation for the use of this as a biomarker to identify patients suitable for treatment with DNA-damaging agents. Inherited and acquired defects in homologous recombination DNA repair, a phenotype termed ""BRCAness,"" may be present in a large proportion of TNBC cases, making it an attractive selection and response biomarker for DNA-damaging therapy. Triple-negative breast cancer is a diverse entity for which additional subclassifications are needed. Increasing understanding of biologic heterogeneity of TNBC has provided insight into identifying potentially effective systemic therapies, including cytotoxic and targeted agents. Numerous experimental approaches are under way, and several encouraging drug classes, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, platinum agents, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase pathway inhibitors, and androgen receptor inhibitors, are being investigated in TNBC. Molecular biomarker-based patient selection in early-phase trials has the potential to accelerate development of effective therapies for this aggressive breast cancer subtype. TNBC is a complex disease, and it is likely that several different targeted approaches will be needed to make meaningful strides in improving the outcomes.


IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype that is associated with poor outcomes. This article reviews clinical features and discusses the molecular diversity of this unique subtype. Current treatment paradigms, the role of germline testing, and platinum agents in TNBC are reviewed. Results and observations from pertinent clinical trials with potential implications for patient management are summarized. This article also discusses the clinical development and ongoing clinical trials of novel promising therapeutic agents in TNBC."

The tumor molecular heterogeneity of TNBC has been well recognized, yet molecular subtype driven therapy remains lacking. While neoadjuvant anthracycline and taxane-based chemotherapy remains the standard of care for early stage TNBC, the optimal chemotherapy regimen is debatable. The addition of carboplatin to anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, and taxane (ACT) regimen is associated with improved complete pathologic response (pCR). Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) combinations significantly increase pCR in TNBC. Increased tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TILs) or the presence of DNA repair deficiency (DRD) mutation is associated with increased pCR. Other targets, such as poly-ADP-ribosyl polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) and Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Protein Kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K-AKT-mTOR) pathway inhibitors, are being evaluated in the neoadjuvant setting. This review examines recent progress in neoadjuvant therapy of TNBC, including platinum, ICI, PARPi, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) pathway targeted therapies, and novel tumor microenvironment (TME) targeted therapy, in addition to biomarkers for the prediction of pCR."

A known contributor to chemoresistance is dysfunctional mitochondrial apoptosis signaling. We set up a phenotypic small-molecule screen to reveal vulnerabilities in TNBC cells that were independent of mitochondrial apoptosis. Using a functional genetic approach, we identified that a “hit” compound, BAS-2, had a potentially similar mechanism of action to histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDAC). An in vitro HDAC inhibitor assay confirmed that the compound selectively inhibited HDAC6. Using state-of-the-art acetylome mass spectrometry, we identified glycolytic substrates of HDAC6 in TNBC cells. We confirmed that inhibition or knockout of HDAC6 reduced glycolytic metabolism both in vitro and in vivo. Through a series of unbiased screening approaches, we have identified a previously unidentified role for HDAC6 in regulating glycolytic metabolism."

MiRNAs, ncRNAs of approximately 19–25 nucleotides in length, are involved in gene expression regulation either via degradation or silencing of the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and have roles in multiple biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. LncRNAs, which are longer than 200 nucleotides, comprise one of the largest and most heterogeneous RNA families. LncRNAs can activate or repress gene expression through various mechanisms, acting alone or in combination with miRNAs and other molecules as part of various pathways. Until recently, most research has focused on individual lncRNA and miRNA functions as regulators, and there is limited available data on ncRNA interactions relating to the tumor growth, metastasis, and therapy of cancer, acting either on mRNA alone or as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents approximately 10%–20% of all breast cancers (BCs) and is highly heterogenous and more aggressive than other types of BC, for which current targeted treatment options include hormonotherapy, PARP inhibitors, and immunotherapy; however, no targeted therapies for TNBC are available, partly because of a lack of predictive biomarkers. With advances in proteomics, new evidence has emerged demonstrating the implications of dysregulation of ncRNAs in TNBC etiology. Here, we review the roles of lncRNAs and miRNAs implicated in TNBC, including their interactions and regulatory networks. Our synthesis provides insight into the mechanisms involved in TNBC progression and has potential to aid the discovery of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."

Upon laser irradiation, the ICG component of ISPN highly efficiently induces immunogenic cell death of the tumor cells via activating antitumor immune response through photodynamic therapy. Meanwhile, PTX delivered by ISPN suppresses the regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs) to combat ITM. The combination treatment of TNBC with ISPN and αPD‐L1‐medaited immune checkpoint blockade therapy displays a synergistic effect on tumor regression, metastasis inhibition, and recurrence prevention. Overall, the ICG‐templated nanomedicine may represent a robust nanoplatform for combination immunotherapy."

Studies with TNBC cells suggest that chemotherapy-resistant populations of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) with self-renewing and tumor-initiating capacities are responsible for these relapses. TGF-β has been shown to increase stem-like properties in human breast cancer cells. We analyzed RNA expression in matched pairs of primary breast cancer biopsies before and after chemotherapy. Biopsies after chemotherapy displayed increased RNA transcripts of genes associated with CSCs and TGF-β signaling. In TNBC cell lines and mouse xenografts, the chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel increased autocrine TGF-β signaling and IL-8 expression and enriched for CSCs, as indicated by mammosphere formation and CSC markers. The TGF-β type I receptor kinase inhibitor LY2157299, a neutralizing TGF-β type II receptor antibody, and SMAD4 siRNA all blocked paclitaxel-induced IL8 transcription and CSC expansion. Moreover, treatment of TNBC xenografts with LY2157299 prevented reestablishment of tumors after paclitaxel treatment. These data suggest that chemotherapy-induced TGF-β signaling enhances tumor recurrence through IL-8-dependent expansion of CSCs and that TGF-β pathway inhibitors prevent the development of drug-resistant CSCs. These findings support testing a combination of TGF-β inhibitors and anticancer chemotherapy in patients with TNBC."

Owing to the lack of targeted therapy and heterogenic nature of TNBC, chemotherapy remains the sole treatment option for TNBC, with taxanes and anthracyclines representing the general chemotherapeutic regimen in TNBC therapy. But unfortunately, patients develop resistance to the existing chemotherapeutic regimen, resulting in approximately 90% treatment failure. Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are one of the major causes for the development of chemoresistance in TNBC patients. After surviving the chemotherapy damage, the presence of BCSCs results in relapse and recurrence of TNBC. Several pathways are known to regulate BCSCs' survival, such as the Wnt/β-catenin, Hedgehog, JAK/STAT and HIPPO pathways. Therefore it is imperative to target these pathways in the context of eliminating chemoresistance.

Since DNA methylation-induced silencing of tumor suppressors is common in cancer, reversal of promoter DNA hypermethylation by 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (decitabine), an FDA-approved DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor, has proven effective in treating hematological neoplasms. However, its antitumor effect varies in solid tumors, stressing the importance of identifying biomarkers predictive of therapeutic response. Here, we focused on the identification of biomarkers to select decitabine-sensitive TNBC through increasing our understanding of the mechanism of decitabine action. We showed that protein levels of DNMTs correlated with response to decitabine in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) organoids originating from chemotherapy-sensitive and -resistant TNBCs, suggesting DNMT levels as potential biomarkers of response. Furthermore, all 3 methytransferases, DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, were degraded following low-concentration, long-term decitabine treatment both in vitro and in vivo. The DNMT proteins could be ubiquitinated by the E3 ligase, TNF receptor–associated factor 6 (TRAF6), leading to lysosome-dependent protein degradation. Depletion of TRAF6 blocked decitabine-induced DNMT degradation, conferring resistance to decitabine. Our study suggests a potential mechanism of regulating DNMT protein degradation and DNMT levels as response biomarkers for DNMT inhibitors in TNBCs."

In solid tumors, however, sustained antitumor responses after CAR T-cell therapy remain to be demonstrated both in the pre-clinical and clinical setting. A perceived barrier to the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy in solid tumors is the hostile tumor microenvironment where immunosuppressive soluble factors like transforming growth factor (TGF)-β are thought to inhibit the cellular immune response. Here, we analyzed whether CAR T-cells specific for the receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) antigen, that is frequently expressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), are susceptible to inhibition by TGF-β and evaluated TGF-β-receptor signaling blockade as a way of neutralizing the inhibitory effect of this cytokine. Methods CD8+ and CD4+ ROR1-CAR T-cells were prepared from healthy donors and their antitumor function analyzed using the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 in vitro and in a microphysiologic 3D tumor model. Analyses were performed in co-culture assays of ROR1-CAR T-cells and MDA-MB-231 cells with addition of exogenous TGF-β. Results The data show that exposure to TGF-β engages TGF-β-receptor signaling in CD8+ and CD4+ ROR1-CAR T-cells as evidenced by phosphorylation of small mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2. In the presence of TGF-β, the cytolytic activity, cytokine production and proliferation of ROR1-CAR T-cells in co-culture with MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells were markedly impaired, and the viability of ROR1-CAR T-cells reduced. Blockade of TGF-β-receptor signaling with the specific kinase inhibitor SD-208 was able to protect CD8+ and CD4+ ROR1-CAR T-cells from the inhibitory effect of TGF-β, and sustained their antitumor function in vitro and in the microphysiologic 3D tumor model. Combination treatment with SD-208 also led to increased viability and lower expression of PD-1 on ROR1-CAR T-cells at the end of the antitumor response. Conclusion We demonstrate the TGF-β suppresses the antitumor function of ROR1-CAR T-cells against TNBC in preclinical models. Our study supports the continued preclinical development and the clinical evaluation of combination treatments that shield CAR T-cells from TGF-β, as exemplified by the TGF-β-receptor kinase inhibitor SD-208 in this study."

Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) exhibit higher rates of metastasis after diagnosis, relative to estrogen-positive breast cancers, but while TNBC cells are relatively more resistant to anoikis, the mechanisms involved are unclear. Through gene expression and metabolomic profiling of TNBC cells in forced suspension culture, we identified a molecular pathway critical for anchorage-independent cell survival. TNBC cells in suspension upregulated multiple genes in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan catabolism, including the enzyme tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2), in an NF-κB-dependent manner. Kynurenine production mediated by TDO2 in TNBC cells was sufficient to activate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), an endogenous kynurenine receptor. Notably, pharmacologic inhibition or genetic attenuation of TDO2 or AhR increased cellular sensitivity to anoikis, and also reduced proliferation, migration, and invasion of TNBC cells. In vivo, TDO2 inhibitor-treated TNBC cells inhibited colonization of the lung, suggesting that TDO2 enhanced metastatic capacity. In clinical specimens of TNBC, elevated expression of TDO2 was associated with increased disease grade, estrogen receptor-negative status, and shorter overall survival. Our results define an NF-κB-regulated signaling axis that promotes anoikis resistance, suggest functional connections with inflammatory modulation by the kynurenine pathway, and highlight TDO2 as an attractive target for treatment of this aggressive breast cancer subtype."

Recent advances in the role of breast cancer stem cells in triple negative breast cancer and the identification of cancer stem cell biomarkers have paved the way for the development of new targeted therapies. The discovery of potential molecular signaling pathways targeting breast cancer stem cells to overcome chemoresistance and prevent metastasis will improve the overall survival of patients with triple negative breast cancer. Abstract Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains an aggressive disease due to the lack of targeted therapies and low rate of response to chemotherapy that is currently the main treatment modality for TNBC. Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are a small subpopulation of breast tumors and recognized as drivers of tumorigenesis. TNBC tumors are characterized as being enriched for BCSCs. Studies have demonstrated the role of BCSCs as the source of metastatic disease and chemoresistance in TNBC. Multiple targets against BCSCs are now under investigation, with the considerations of either selectively targeting BCSCs or co-targeting BCSCs and non-BCSCs (majority of tumor cells). This review article provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the role of BCSCs in TNBC and the identification of cancer stem cell biomarkers, paving the way for the development of new targeted therapies. The review also highlights the resultant discovery of cancer stem cell targets in TNBC and the ongoing clinical trials treating chemoresistant breast cancer. We aim to provide insights into better understanding the mutational landscape of BCSCs and exploring potential molecular signaling pathways targeting BCSCs to overcome chemoresistance and prevent metastasis in TNBC, ultimately to improve the overall survival of patients with this devastating disease."

EGFR-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are potent and specific in suppressing the growth of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in vitro and in vivo. However, in this study, a subset of mice soon acquired resistance, which limits the potential use of EGFR CAR T cells. We aimed to find a way to overcome the observed resistance. Transcriptomic analysis results revealed that EGFR CAR T-cell treatment induced a set of immunosuppressive genes, presumably through IFNγ signaling, in EGFR CAR T-cell–resistant TNBC tumors. The EGFR CAR T-cell–induced immunosuppressive genes were associated with EGFR CAR T-cell–activated enhancers and were especially sensitive to THZ1, a CDK7 inhibitor we screened out of a panel of small molecules targeting epigenetic modulators. Accordingly, combination therapy with THZ1 and EGFR CAR T cells suppressed immune resistance, tumor growth, and metastasis in TNBC tumor models, including human MDA-MB-231 cell–derived and TNBC patient–derived xenografts, and mouse EMT6 cell–derived allografts. Taken together, we demonstrated that transcriptional modulation using epigenetic inhibitors could overcome CAR T-cell therapy–induced immune resistance, thus providing a therapeutic avenue for treating TNBC in the clinic."

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 15% to 20% of all invasive breast carcinomas and is defined by the lack of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Although TNBC is characterized by high rates of disease recurrence and worse survival, it is significantly more sensitive to chemotherapy as compared with other breast cancer subtypes. Accordingly, despite great efforts in the genomic characterization of TNBC, chemotherapy still represents the cornerstone of treatment. For the majority of patients with early-stage TNBC, sequential anthracycline- and taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) represents the standard therapeutic approach, with pathological complete response that strongly correlates with long-term survival outcomes. However, some issues about the optimal neoadjuvant regimen, as well as the effective role of chemotherapy in patients with residual disease after NACT, are still debated. Herein, we will review the current evidences that guide the use of (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early-stage TNBC. Furthermore, we will discuss current controversies, including the incorporation of platinum compounds to the neoadjuvant backbone and the optimal treatment for patients with residual disease after NACT. Lastly, we will outline potential future directions that can guide treatment escalation and de-escalation, as well as the development of new therapies. In our view, the application of multi-omics technologies, liquid biopsy assays, and machine learning algorithms are strongly warranted to pave the way toward personalized anticancer treatment for early-stage TNBC."

However, the anticancer mechanism of RSV on triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains unclear. In the present study, the antitumor effects and mechanism of RSV on TNBC cells were analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), which was then verified via cell counting kit-8 (CCK8), immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, Western Blot (WB), flow cytometry, and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. According to the corresponding findings, the survival rate of MDA-MB-231 cells gradually decreased as RSV treatment concentration increased. The RNA-seq analysis results demonstrated that genes affected by RSV treatment were mainly involved in apoptosis and the p53 signaling pathway. Moreover, apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells induced by RSV was observed to be mainly mediated by POLD1. When treated with RSV, the expression levels of full length PARP1, PCNA, and BCL-2 were found to be significantly reduced, and the expression level of Cleaved-PARP1 as well as Cleaved-Caspase3 increased significantly. Additionally, the mRNA expression of POLD1 was significantly reduced after treatment with RSV, and the protein expression level was also inhibited by RSV in a concentration-dependent manner. The prediction of domain interaction suggested that RSV may bind to at least five functional domains of the POLD1 protein (6s1m, 6s1n, 6s1o, 6tny and 6tnz). Furthermore, after RSV treatment, the anti-apoptotic index (PCNA, BCL-2) of MDA-MB-231 cells was found to decrease while the apoptosis index (caspase3) increased. Moreover, the overexpression of POLD1 reduced the extent of apoptosis observed in MDA-MB-231 cells following RSV treatment. Moreover, animal experimental results showed that RSV had a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of live tumors, while POLD1 overexpression was shown to antagonize this inhibitory effect. Accordingly, this study’s findings reveal that RSV may promote the apoptosis of TNBC cells by reducing the expression of POLD1 to activate the apoptotic pathway, which may serve as a potential therapy for the treatment of TNBC."

Local recurrence rate after standard therapy in the early breast cancer setting can be upwards to 72% in 5 years, and in the metastatic setting, the 5-year overall survival is 12%. Due to the lack of receptor expression, there has been a paucity of targeted therapeutics available, with chemotherapy being the primary option for systemic treatment in both the neoadjuvant and metastatic setting. More recently, immunotherapy has revolutionized the landscape of cancer treatment, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, with FDA approval in over 20 types of cancer since 2011. Compared to other cancer types, breast cancer has been traditionally thought of as being immunologically cold; however, TNBC has demonstrated the most promise with immunotherapy use, a timely discovery due to its lack of targeted therapy options. In this review, we summarize the trials using checkpoint therapy in early and metastatic TNBC, as well as the development of biomarkers and the importance of immune related adverse events (IRAEs), in this disease process."

Finding novel treatment options with minimum or no toxicity is of great importance in treating or preventing TNBC. Flavonoids are new attractive molecules that might fulfill this promising therapeutic option. Flavonoids have shown many biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. In addition to their anticancer effects by arresting the cell cycle, inducing apoptosis, and suppressing cancer cell proliferation, flavonoids can modulate non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) function. Several preclinical and epidemiological studies indicate the possible therapeutic potential of these compounds. Flavonoids display a unique ability to change miRNAs’ levels via different mechanisms, either by suppressing oncogenic miRNAs or activating oncosuppressor miRNAs or affecting transcriptional, epigenetic miRNA processing in TNBC. Flavonoids are not only involved in the regulation of miRNA-mediated cancer initiation, growth, proliferation, differentiation, invasion, metastasis, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), but also control miRNAs-mediated biological processes that significantly impact TNBC, such as cell cycle, immune system, mitochondrial dysregulation, modulating signaling pathways, inflammation, and angiogenesis. In this review, we highlighted the role of miRNAs in TNBC cancer progression and the effect of flavonoids on miRNA regulation, emphasizing their anticipated role in the prevention and treatment of TNBC."

The severity of TNBC is primarily observed in younger women, with cases ranging from approximately 12%–24% of all breast cancer cases. The existing hormonal therapies offer limited clinical solutions in completely circumventing the TNBC, with chemoresistance and tumor recurrences being the common hurdles in the path of TNBC treatment. Accumulating evidence has correlated the dysregulation of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) with increased cell proliferation, invasion, migration, tumor growth, chemoresistance, and decreased apoptosis in TNBC. Various clinical studies have revealed that aberrant expression of lncRNAs in TNBC tissues is associated with poor prognosis, lower overall survival, and disease‐free survival. Due to these specific characteristics, lncRNAs have emerged as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for TNBC treatment. However, the underlying mechanism through which lncRNAs perform their actions remains unclear, and extensive research is being carried out to reveal it. Therefore, understanding of mechanisms regulating the modulation of lncRNAs will be a substantial breakthrough in effective treatment therapies for TNBC. This review highlights the association of several lncRNAs in TNBC progression and treatment, along with their possible functions and mechanisms."

Up to 30% of mesenchymal TNBC can be classified histologically as metaplastic breast cancer, a chemorefractory group of tumors with a mixture of epithelial and mesenchymal components identifiable by light microscopy. While assays to identify mesenchymal TNBC are under development, metaplastic breast cancer serves as a clinically identifiable surrogate to evaluate potential regimens for mesenchymal TNBC. Objective To assess safety and efficacy of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition in combination with liposomal doxorubicin and bevacizumab in patients with advanced metaplastic TNBC. Design, Setting, and Participants Phase 1 study with dose escalation and dose expansion at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center of patients with advanced metaplastic TNBC. Patients were enrolled from April 16, 2009, to November 4, 2014, and followed for outcomes with a cutoff date of November 1, 2015, for data analysis. Interventions Liposomal doxorubicin, bevacizumab, and the mTOR inhibitors temsirolimus or everolimus using 21-day cycles. Main Outcomes and Measures Safety and response. When available, archived tissue was evaluated for aberrations in the PI3K pathway. Results Fifty-two women with metaplastic TNBC (median age, 58 years; range, 37-79 years) were treated with liposomal doxorubicin, bevacizumab, and temsirolimus (DAT) (N = 39) or liposomal doxorubicin, bevacizumab, and everolimus (DAE) (N = 13). The objective response rate was 21% (complete response = 4 [8%]; partial response = 7 [13%]) and 10 (19%) patients had stable disease for at least 6 months, for a clinical benefit rate of 40%. Tissue was available for testing in 43 patients, and 32 (74%) had a PI3K pathway aberration. Presence of PI3K pathway aberration was associated with a significant improvement in objective response rate (31% vs 0%; P = .04) but not clinical benefit rate (44% vs 45%; P > .99). Conclusions and Relevance Using metaplastic TNBC as a surrogate for mesenchymal TNBC, DAT and DAE had notable activity in mesenchymal TNBC. Objective response was limited to patients with PI3K pathway aberration. A randomized trial should be performed to test DAT and DAE for metaplastic TNBC, as well as nonmetaplastic, mesenchymal TNBC, especially when PI3K pathway aberrations are identified."

In particular, miR-21, an oncogenic miRNA is a major player involved in tumor initiation, progression, invasion and metastasis in several cancers, including triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, delivery of therapeutic miRNA or anti-miRNA specifically into cancer cells in vivo without collateral damage to healthy cells remains challenging. We report here the application of RNA nanotechnology for specific and efficient delivery of anti-miR-21 to block the growth of TNBC in orthotopic mouse models. The 15 nm therapeutic RNA nanoparticles contains the 58-nucleotide (nt) phi29 pRNA-3WJ as a core, a 8-nt sequence complementary to the seed region of miR-21, and a 39-nt epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting aptamer for internalizing RNA nanoparticles into cancer cells via receptor mediated endocytosis. The RNase resistant and thermodynamically stable RNA nanoparticles remained intact after systemic injection into mice and strongly bound to tumors with little or no accumulation in healthy organs 8 h postinjection, and subsequently repressed tumor growth at low doses. The observed specific cancer targeting and tumor regression is a result of several key attributes of RNA nanoparticles: anionic charge which disallows nonspecific passage across negatively charged cell membrane; “active” targeting using RNA aptamers which increases the homing of RNA nanoparticles to cancer cells; nanoscale size and shape which avoids rapid renal clearance and engulfment by lung macrophages and liver Kupffer cells; favorable biodistribution profiles with little accumulation in healthy organs, which minimizes nonspecific side effects; and favorable pharmacokinetic profiles with extended in vivo half-life.

MYC regulates expression of RNA, both protein and non-coding, that control central metabolic pathways, cell death, proliferation, differentiation, stress pathways, and mechanisms of drug resistance. Activation of MYC has been widely reported in breast cancer progression. Breast cancer is a complex heterogeneous disease and treatment options are primarily guided by histological and biochemical evaluations of the tumors. Based on biochemical markers, three main breast cancer categories are ER+ (estrogen receptor alpha positive), HER2+ (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive), and TNBC (triple-negative breast cancer; estrogen receptor negative, progesterone receptor negative, HER2 negative). MYC is elevated in TNBC compared with other cancer subtypes. Interestingly, MYC-driven pathways are further elevated in aggressive breast cancer cells and tumors that display drug resistant phenotype. Identification of MYC target genes is essential in isolating signaling pathways that drive tumor development. In this review, we address the role of MYC in the three major breast cancer subtypes and highlight the most promising leads to target MYC functions."

Here, we show that evasion from viral mimicry response allows the growth of taxane-resistant triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This is enabled by an epigenetic state adapted to taxane-induced metabolic stress, where DNA hypomethylation over loci enriched in transposable elements (TEs) is compensated by large chromatin domains of H3K27me3 to warrant TE repression. This epigenetic state creates a vulnerability to epigenetic therapy against EZH2, the H3K27me3 methyltransferase, which alleviates TE repression in taxane-resistant TNBC, leading to double-stranded RNA production and growth inhibition through viral mimicry response. Collectively, our results illustrate how epigenetic states over TEs promote cancer progression under treatment and can inform of vulnerabilities to epigenetic therapy."

The development of efficient tar-geted TNBC therapy has been considered as an important research topic in TNBC treatment. We report the development of a new ap-tamer-drug conjugate (ApDC), AS1411-triptolide conjugate (ATC), as targeted therapy for the treatment of TNBC with high efficacy. The coupling of triptolide with aptamer conferred it with excellent specificity and significantly increased cytotoxicity against the MDA-MB-231 cell line. The advantages of our newly invented ApDC were further highlighted by its excellent in vivo anti-TNBC efficacy, and negligible side effects towards healthy organs. Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women in global. Immunohistochemical (IHC) indicates that breast cancer can be divided into three distinct groups based on the expression of three important receptors, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and Erb-B2 Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 2 (HER2). Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) refers to any breast cancer that does not express ER, PR, and HER2.1 Studies have shown it accounts for about 15-20% of all breast cancer cases.2 TNBC is much easier to spread to other healthy organs and more likely to relapse after treatment than the other breast cancer types, it thus has been considered to be the most malignant subtype of breast cancer.3 Currently, the treatment of TNBC usually relies on a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. It is of interest that TNBC tumors respond well to chemotherapy compared with other subtypes, however, the lack of ER, PR, and HER2 makes it more difficult to apply commonly used targeted cancer therapy approach-es such as endocrine therapy. It is thus particularly complicated to find the optimal chemotherapy for TBNC patients.4, 5 The develop-ment of novel yet practical chemotherapies thus become an urgent task to do, and would be greatly appreciated."
Metabolic reprogramming in triple-negative breast cancer,"[{'authorId': '2108405619', 'name': 'Zhanyu Wang'}, {'authorId': '2113805529', 'name': 'Qianjin Jiang'}, {'authorId': '49944792', 'name': 'Chenfang Dong'}]",78,2020,a27fa2fbeb7bab9e3eaee86203e99ff9aa860029,"Since triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) was first defined over a decade ago, increasing studies have focused on its genetic and molecular characteristics. Patients diagnosed with TNBC, compared to those diagnosed with other breast cancer subtypes, have relatively poor outcomes due to high tumor aggressiveness and lack of targeted treatment. Metabolic reprogramming, an emerging hallmark of cancer, is hijacked by TNBC to fulfill bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands; maintain the redox balance; and further promote oncogenic signaling, cell proliferation, and metastasis. Understanding the mechanisms of metabolic remodeling may guide the design of metabolic strategies for the effective intervention of TNBC. Here, we review the metabolic reprogramming of glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and other branched pathways in TNBC and explore opportunities for new biomarkers, imaging modalities, and metabolically targeted therapies."

Because anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens are standard treatment for TNBC, we investigated the relationship between CD73 and anthracycline efficacy. In TNBC patients treated with anthracycline-only preoperative chemotherapy, high CD73 gene expression was significantly associated with a lower rate of pathological complete response or the disappearance of invasive tumor at surgery. Using mouse models of breast cancer, we demonstrated that CD73 overexpression in tumor cells conferred chemoresistance to doxorubicin, a commonly used anthracycline, by suppressing adaptive antitumor immune responses via activation of A2A adenosine receptors. Targeted blockade of CD73 enhanced doxorubicin-mediated antitumor immune responses and significantly prolonged the survival of mice with established metastatic breast cancer. Taken together, our data suggest that CD73 constitutes a therapeutic target in TNBC."

Exploring key lncRNAs and elucidating the mechanisms contributing to radioresistance are crucial for the development of effective strategies to reverse radioresistance, which however remains challenging. Here, actin filament‐associated protein 1 antisense RNA1 (lncAFAP1‐AS1) is identified as a key factor in inducing radioresistance of triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) via activating the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway. Considering the generation of a high concentration of reduction agent glutathione (GSH) under radiation, a reduction‐responsive nanoparticle (NP) platform is engineered for effective lncAFAP1‐AS1 siRNA (siAFAP1‐AS1) delivery. Systemic delivery of siAFAP1‐AS1 with the reduction‐responsive NPs can synergistically reverse radioresistance by silencing lncAFAP1‐AS1 expression and scavenging intracellular GSH, leading to a dramatically enhanced radiotherapy effect in both xenograft and metastatic TNBC tumor models. The findings indicate that lncAFAP1‐AS1 can be used to predict the outcome of TNBC radiotherapy and combination of systemic siAFAP1‐AS1 delivery with radiotherapy can be applied for the treatment of recurrent TNBC patients."

Vasculogenic mimicry detected in TNBCs, seems to be determined by a population of CD133+ cells and may be stimulated by different pharmacological agents such sunitinib. Despite the fact that TNBCs do not usually metastasize through the lymphatic pathways, TNBCs may be characterized by lymphatic invasion and by an increased lymphatic microvascular density. If TNBCs treatment depends on the molecular profile of the tumor, the same statement may be postulated for TNBCs metastasis. Whether metastases have a similar phenotype as the primary tumor remains an enigma. Therefore, the question: ‘Could TNBC be subject to a standardized, unanimously accepted therapeutic strategy or is it strictly subclass-dependent?’ remains to be further investigated."

In this study, we report the development of a second-generation BET protein degrader, BETd-246, which exhibits superior selectivity, potency, and antitumor activity. In human TNBC cells, BETd-246 induced degradation of BET proteins at low nanomolar concentrations within 1 hour of exposure, resulting in robust growth inhibition and apoptosis. BETd-246 was more potent and effective in TNBC cells than its parental BET inhibitor compound BETi-211. RNA-seq analysis revealed predominant downregulation of a large number of genes involved in proliferation and apoptosis in cells treated with BETd-246, as compared with BETi-211 treatment that upregulated and downregulated a similar number of genes. Functional investigations identified the MCL1 gene as a critical downstream effector for BET degraders, which synergized with small-molecule inhibitors of BCL-xL in triggering apoptosis. In multiple murine xenograft models of human breast cancer, BETd-246 and a further optimized analogue BETd-260 effectively depleted BET proteins in tumors and exhibited strong antitumor activities at well-tolerated dosing schedules.

Immunotherapy has shown promising results in various types of cancer, including breast cancer. Here, we investigated a new combination strategy where histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are applied with immune checkpoint inhibitors to improve immunotherapy responses in TNBC. Testing different epigenetic modifiers, we focused on the mechanisms underlying HDACi as priming modulators of immunotherapy. Tumor cells were co-cultured with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and flow cytometric immunophenotyping was performed to define the role of epigenetic priming in promoting tumor antigen presentation and immune cell activation. We found that HDACi up-regulate PD-L1 mRNA and protein expression in a time-dependent manner in TNBC cells, but not in hormone responsive cells. Focusing on TNBC, HDACi up-regulated PD-L1 and HLA-DR on tumor cells when co-cultured with PBMCs and down-regulated CD4+ Foxp3+ Treg in vitro. HDACi significantly enhanced the in vivo response to PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade in the triple-negative 4T1 breast cancer mouse model, the only currently available experimental system with functional resemblance to human TNBC. This resulted in a significant decrease in tumor growth and increased survival, associated with increased T cell tumor infiltration and a reduction in CD4+ Foxp3+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Overall, our results suggest a novel role for HDAC inhibition in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors and identify a promising therapeutic strategy, supporting its further clinical evaluation for TNBC treatment."

Here, we highlight a new cross talk between chronic oxidative stress and the histone variant H2AX, a key player in DNA repair. We observe that persistent accumulation of ROS, due to a deficient JunD‐/Nrf2‐antioxidant response, reduces H2AX protein levels. This effect is mediated by an enhanced interaction of H2AX with the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF168, which is associated with H2AX poly‐ubiquitination and promotes its degradation by the proteasome. ROS‐mediated H2AX decrease plays a crucial role in chemosensitivity. Indeed, cycles of chemotherapy that sustainably increase ROS reduce H2AX protein levels in Triple‐Negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. H2AX decrease by such treatment is associated with an impaired NRF2‐antioxidant response and is indicative of the therapeutic efficiency and survival of TNBC patients. Thus, our data describe a novel ROS‐mediated regulation of H2AX turnover, which provides new insights into genetic instability and treatment efficacy in TNBC patients."

In addition, we enrolled 82 TNBC patients who underwent taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) to further verify the predictive value of the signature. In both the training and validation sets, the integrated signature had better prognostic value than clinicopathologic parameters. We also confirmed the interaction between the administration of taxane-based NCT and different risk groups. In the NCT cohort, patients in the low-risk group were more likely to achieve pathologic complete remission after taxane-based NCT (P = 0.014). Functionally, we showed that HIF1A-AS2 and AK124454 promoted cell proliferation and invasion in TNBC cells and contributed there to paclitaxel resistance.

There is a need to develop surrogates for treatment efficacy in the neoadjuvant setting to speed-up drug development and stratify patients according to outcome. Preclinical studies showed that chemotherapy induces an antitumor immune response. In order to develop new surrogates for drug efficacy, we assessed the prognostic value of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) on residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Three hundred four TNBC patients with residual disease after NACT were retrospectively identified in three different hospitals. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides from surgical postchemotherapy specimens were evaluated for intratumoral (It-TIL) and stromal (Str-TIL) TIL. Cases were classified as High-TIL if It-TIL and/or Str-TIL >60%.


RESULTS
TIL were assessable for 278 cases. Continuous It-TIL and Str-TIL variables were strong prognostic factors in the multivariate model, both for metastasis-free [hazard ratio (HR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77-0.96, P = 0.01 and HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75-0.98, P = 0.02 for Str-TIL and It-TIL, respectively] and overall survival (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77-0.97, P = 0.01 and HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75-0.99, P = 0.03 for Str-TIL and It-TIL, respectively). The 5-year overall survival rate was 91% (95% CI 68% to 97%) for High-TIL patients (n = 27) and 55% (95% CI 48% to 61%) for Low-TIL patients (HR 0.19, 95% CI 0.06-0.61, log-rank P = 0.0017). The major prognostic impact of TIL was seen for patients with large tumor burden following NACT (residual tumor >2 cm and/or node metastasis). In all but one High-TIL case, It-TIL and Str-TIL values were lower on the prechemotherapy sample.


CONCLUSIONS
The presence of TIL in residual disease after NACT is associated with better prognosis in TNBC patients. This parameter may represent a new surrogate of drug efficacy to test investigational agents in the neoadjuvant setting and a new prognostic marker to select patients at high risk of relapse."

ROS are known to have a controversial role during cancer initiation and progression and although several studies have tried to manipulate intracellular ROS levels using antioxidants or pro-oxidation conditions, it is not yet clear how to target oxidation for cancer therapy. In this study, we found differences in mitochondrial morphology in breast cancer cells when compared to a non-tumorigenic cell line and differences in mitochondrial function among breast cancer subtypes when exploring gene-expression data from the TCGA tumor dataset. Interestingly, we found increased ROS levels in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines and a dependency on ROS for survival since antioxidant treatment induced cell death in TNBC cells but not in an estrogen receptor positive (ER+) cell line. Moreover, we identified the mitochondria as the main source of ROS in TNBC cell lines. Our results indicate a potential use for ROS as a target for therapy in the TNBC subtype which currently has the worst prognosis among all breast cancers and remains as the only breast cancer subtype which lacks a targeted therapy."

Anthracycline- and taxane-based chemotherapy is still the mainstay of treatment in early stages, although several escalation approaches have been evaluated to improve survival outcomes. The addition of platinum salts to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) remains controversial due to the lack of clear survival advantage, and the use of adjuvant capecitabine represents a valid treatment option in TNBC patients with residual disease after NACT. Recently, several clinical trials showed promising results through the use of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and by incorporating immunotherapy with chemotherapy, enriching treatment options beyond conventional cytotoxic agents. In this review, we provided an overview on the current standard of care and a comprehensive update of the recent advances in the management of early stage TNBC and focused on the latest emerging biomarkers and their clinical application to select the best therapeutic strategy in this hard-to-treat population."

Despite clinical responses in specific cancers using inhibitors targeting BRAF and MEK, resistance develops often involving nongenomic adaptive bypass mechanisms. Inhibition of MEK1/2 by trametinib in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) induced dramatic transcriptional responses, including upregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) comparing tumor samples before and after one week of treatment. In preclinical models, MEK inhibition induced genome-wide enhancer formation involving the seeding of BRD4, MED1, H3K27 acetylation, and p300 that drives transcriptional adaptation. Inhibition of the P-TEFb-associated proteins BRD4 and CBP/p300 arrested enhancer seeding and RTK upregulation. BRD4 bromodomain inhibitors overcame trametinib resistance, producing sustained growth inhibition in cells, xenografts, and syngeneic mouse TNBC models. Pharmacologic targeting of P-TEFb members in conjunction with MEK inhibition by trametinib is an effective strategy to durably inhibit epigenomic remodeling required for adaptive resistance.Significance: Widespread transcriptional adaptation to pharmacologic MEK inhibition was observed in TNBC patient tumors. In preclinical models, MEK inhibition induces dramatic genome-wide modulation of chromatin, in the form of de novo enhancer formation and enhancer remodeling.

Using in vitro and in vivo metabolic profiling of TNBC cells, we show that an increase in the abundance of pyrimidine nucleotides occurs in response to chemotherapy exposure. Mechanistically, elevation of pyrimidine nucleotides induced by chemotherapy is dependent on increased activity of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway. Pharmacologic inhibition of de novo pyrimidine synthesis sensitizes TNBC cells to genotoxic chemotherapy agents by exacerbating DNA damage. Moreover, combined treatment with doxorubicin and leflunomide, a clinically approved inhibitor of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway, induces regression of TNBC xenografts. Thus, the increase in pyrimidine nucleotide levels observed following chemotherapy exposure represents a metabolic vulnerability that can be exploited to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy for the treatment of TNBC.Significance: The prognosis for patients with TNBC with residual disease after chemotherapy is poor. We find that chemotherapy agents induce adaptive reprogramming of de novo pyrimidine synthesis and show that this response can be exploited pharmacologically, using clinically approved inhibitors of de novo pyrimidine synthesis, to sensitize TNBC cells to chemotherapy.

There are currently no targeted therapies to treat TNBC. This study offers therapeutic targets for blocking TNBC metastasis: cell-surface antigen CUB-domain containing protein 1 (CDCP1) and proteins in the lipid metabolism pathway. CDCP1 regulates lipid metabolism by reducing cytoplasmic lipid droplet abundance, stimulating fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation. This metabolic pathway likely contributes to the energy production required for cell migration and metastasis of TNBC, and represents a potential therapeutic target. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is notoriously aggressive with high metastatic potential, which has recently been linked to high rates of fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Here we report the mechanism of lipid metabolism dysregulation in TNBC through the prometastatic protein, CUB-domain containing protein 1 (CDCP1). We show that a “low-lipid” phenotype is characteristic of breast cancer cells compared with normal breast epithelial cells and negatively correlates with invasiveness in 3D culture. Using coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering and two-photon excited fluorescence microscopy, we show that CDCP1 depletes lipids from cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs) through reduced acyl-CoA production and increased lipid utilization in the mitochondria through FAO, fueling oxidative phosphorylation. These findings are supported by CDCP1’s interaction with and inhibition of acyl CoA-synthetase ligase (ACSL) activity. Importantly, CDCP1 knockdown increases LD abundance and reduces TNBC 2D migration in vitro, which can be partially rescued by the ACSL inhibitor, Triacsin C. Furthermore, CDCP1 knockdown reduced 3D invasion, which can be rescued by ACSL3 co-knockdown. In vivo, inhibiting CDCP1 activity with an engineered blocking fragment (extracellular portion of cleaved CDCP1) lead to increased LD abundance in primary tumors, decreased metastasis, and increased ACSL activity in two animal models of TNBC. Finally, TNBC lung metastases have lower LD abundance than their corresponding primary tumors, indicating that LD abundance in primary tumor might serve as a prognostic marker for metastatic potential. Our studies have important implications for the development of TNBC therapeutics to specifically block CDCP1-driven FAO and oxidative phosphorylation, which contribute to TNBC migration and metastasis."

Upon irradiation, Azo-CA4-loaded nanocarriers significantly reduced the viability of TNBC cells via both apoptosis and ferroptosis. The former was induced by photoisomerization of Azo-CA4, accompanied with microtubule breakdown and cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. The latter was caused by the UV light-induced reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ that facilitates the peroxidation of tailored lipids. The cooperation between apoptosis and ferroptosis in eliminating TNBC was demonstrated in a xenograft mice model in terms of histological staining, tumor growth inhibition and animal survival. Since the NIR light is only applied to the tumor site, the adverse effects of such triggered nanocarriers to the healthy organs are negligible."

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) ligands regulated by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote accumulation of fibrosis and cancer progression. In the present study, we have evaluated TNBC tumors with enhanced collagen to determine whether we can reduce metastasis by targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD), an anti-fibrotic agent as well as a TGF-β antagonist. In patient-derived xenograft models, TNBC tumors exhibited accumulated collagen and activated TGF-β signaling, and developed lung metastasis. Next, primary CAFs were established from 4T1 TNBC homograft tumors, TNBC xenograft tumors and tumor specimens of breast cancer patients. CAFs promoted primary tumor growth with more fibrosis and TGF-β activation and lung metastasis in 4T1 mouse model. We then examined the effects of PFD in vitro and in vivo. We found that PFD had inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production of CAFs in 2D culture. Furthermore, CAFs enhanced tumor growth and PFD inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs by causing apoptosis in the 3D co-culture assay of 4T1 tumor cells and CAFs. In vivo, PFD alone inhibited tumor fibrosis and TGF-β signaling but did not inhibit tumor growth and lung metastasis. However, PFD inhibited tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically in combination with doxorubicin. Thus, PFD has great potential for a novel clinically applicable TNBC therapy that targets tumor-stromal interaction."

Diverse components of the breast cancer microenvironment, such as suppressive immune cells, re-programmed fibroblast cells, altered extracellular matrix (ECM) and certain soluble factors, synergistically impede an effective anti-tumor response and promote breast cancer progression and metastasis. Among these components, stromal cells in the breast cancer microenvironment are characterized by molecular alterations and aberrant signaling pathways, whereas the ECM features biochemical and biomechanical changes. However, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive subtype of this disease that lacks effective therapies available for other subtypes, is considered to feature a unique microenvironment distinct from that of other subtypes, especially compared to Luminal A subtype. Because these changes are now considered to significantly impact breast cancer development and progression, these unique alterations may serve as promising prognostic factors of clinical outcome or potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of TNBC. In this review, we focus on the composition of the TNBC microenvironment, concomitant distinct biological alteration, specific interplay between various cell types and TNBC cells, and the prognostic implications of these findings."

The molecular heterogeneity of TNBC and lack of high frequency driver mutations other than TP53 have hindered the development of new and effective therapies that significantly improve patient outcomes. miRNAs, global regulators of survival and proliferation pathways important in tumor development and maintenance, are becoming promising therapeutic agents. We performed miRNA-profiling studies in different TNBC subtypes to identify miRNAs that significantly contribute to disease progression. We found that miR-34a was lost in TNBC, specifically within mesenchymal and mesenchymal stem cell-like subtypes, whereas expression of miR-34a targets was significantly enriched. Furthermore, restoration of miR-34a in cell lines representing these subtypes inhibited proliferation and invasion, activated senescence, and promoted sensitivity to dasatinib by targeting the proto-oncogene c-SRC. Notably, SRC depletion in TNBC cell lines phenocopied the effects of miR-34a reintroduction, whereas SRC overexpression rescued the antitumorigenic properties mediated by miR-34a. miR-34a levels also increased when cells were treated with c-SRC inhibitors, suggesting a negative feedback exists between miR-34a and c-SRC. Moreover, miR-34a administration significantly delayed tumor growth of subcutaneously and orthotopically implanted tumors in nude mice, and was accompanied by c-SRC downregulation. Finally, we found that miR-34a and SRC levels were inversely correlated in human tumor specimens. Together, our results demonstrate that miR-34a exerts potent antitumorigenic effects in vitro and in vivo and suggests that miR-34a replacement therapy, which is currently being tested in human clinical trials, represents a promising therapeutic strategy for TNBC."

Here, we report a direct comparative study of ∼90 nm diameter Au nanomatryoshkas (Au/SiO2/Au) and ∼150 nm diameter Au nanoshells for photothermal therapeutic efficacy in highly aggressive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumors in mice. Au nanomatryoshkas are strong light absorbers with 77% absorption efficiency, while the nanoshells are weaker absorbers with only 15% absorption efficiency. After an intravenous injection of Au nanomatryoshkas followed by a single NIR laser dose of 2 W/cm2 for 5 min, 83% of the TNBC tumor-bearing mice appeared healthy and tumor free >60 days later, while only 33% of mice treated with nanoshells survived the same period. The smaller size and larger absorption cross section of Au nanomatryoshkas combine to make this nanoparticle more effective than Au nanoshells for photothermal cancer therapy."

No targeted therapies are currently approved for TNBC, and newer treatment approaches are critically needed. It is increasingly recognized that TNBC is a heterogeneous disease, and the role of androgen signaling in a subset of TNBC is emerging. Although the degree of androgen receptor (AR) expression in TNBC varies widely depending on the assay methodology, cutoff for positivity, and patient population, existing evidence suggests an association between a higher level of AR expression and improved outcomes. Despite lower pathologic complete response (pCR) rates with neoadjuvant therapy, patients with AR-dependent TNBCs have a better prognosis than those with TNBCs that are not AR-dependent. Furthermore, gene expression profiling has been used to identify a luminal androgen receptor subtype of TNBC that is dependent on AR signaling. Early clinical studies investigating agents targeting AR in advanced TNBC have produced promising results. We review herein the literature on the biology of AR in breast cancer and its prognostic and predictive role in TNBC, and we describe the results of early clinical trials with antiandrogens in this population. We also present our vision of the future development of newer therapeutic strategies in AR-dependent TNBC."

The chemokine IL-8 is overexpressed in multiple cancer types, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where it promotes the acquisition of mesenchymal features, stemness, resistance to therapies, and the recruitment of immune-suppressive cells to the tumor site. The present study explores the utility of a clinical-stage monoclonal antibody that neutralizes IL-8 (HuMax-IL8) as a potential therapeutic option for TNBC. HuMax-IL8 was shown to revert mesenchymalization in claudin-low TNBC models both in vitro and in vivo as well as to significantly decrease the recruitment of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) at the tumor site, an effect substantiated when used in combination with docetaxel. In addition, HuMax-IL8 enhanced the susceptibility of claudin-low breast cancer cells to immune-mediated lysis with NK and antigen-specific T cells in vitro. These results demonstrate the multifaceted way in which neutralizing this single chemokine reverts mesenchymalization, decreases recruitment of MDSCs at the tumor site, assists in immune-mediated killing, and forms the rationale for using HuMax-IL8 in combination with chemotherapy or immune-based therapies for the treatment of TNBC."

Deubiquitinases (DUB) are emerging drug targets. The identification of highly active DUBs in TNBC may lead to novel therapies. Experimental Design: Using DUB activity probes, we profiled global DUB activities in 52 breast cancer cell lines and 52 patients' tumor tissues. To validate our findings in vivo, we employed both zebrafish and murine breast cancer xenograft models. Cellular and molecular mechanisms were elucidated using in vivo and in vitro biochemical methods. A specific inhibitor was synthesized, and its biochemical and biological functions were assessed in a range of assays. Finally, we used patient sera samples to investigate clinical correlations. Results: Two DUB activity profiling approaches identified UCHL1 as being highly active in TNBC cell lines and aggressive tumors. Functionally, UCHL1 promoted metastasis in zebrafish and murine breast cancer xenograft models. Mechanistically, UCHL1 facilitates TGFβ signaling–induced metastasis by protecting TGFβ type I receptor and SMAD2 from ubiquitination. We found that these responses are potently suppressed by the specific UCHL1 inhibitor, 6RK73. Furthermore, UCHL1 levels were significantly increased in sera of patients with TNBC, and highly enriched in sera exosomes as well as TNBC cell–conditioned media. UCHL1-enriched exosomes stimulated breast cancer migration and extravasation, suggesting that UCHL1 may act in a paracrine manner to promote tumor progression. Conclusions: Our DUB activity profiling identified UCHL1 as a candidate oncoprotein that promotes TGFβ-induced breast cancer metastasis and may provide a potential target for TNBC treatment."

Concomitant capecitabine may be beneficial, but robust data to support this are lacking. The efficacy and safety of the addition of capecitabine into the TNBC adjuvant treatment regimen was evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS This randomized, open-label, phase III trial was conducted in China. Eligible female patients with early TNBC after definitive surgery were randomly assigned (1:1) to either capecitabine (3 cycles of capecitabine and docetaxel followed by 3 cycles of capecitabine, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide) or control treatment (3 cycles of docetaxel followed by 3 cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide). Randomization was centralized without stratification. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS Between June 2012 and December 2013, 636 patients with TNBC were screened, and 585 were randomly assigned to treatment (control, 288; capecitabine, 297). Median follow-up was 67 months. The 5-year DFS rate was higher for capecitabine than for control treatment (86.3% v 80.4%; hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.99; P = .044). Five-year overall survival rates were numerically higher but not significantly improved (capecitabine, 93.3%; control, 90.7%). Overall, 39.1% of patients had capecitabine dose reductions, and 8.4% reported grade ≥ 3 hand-foot syndrome. The most common grade ≥ 3 hematologic toxicities were neutropenia (capecitabine, 136 [45.8%]; control, 118 [41.0%]) and febrile neutropenia (capecitabine, 50 [16.8%]; control, 46 [16.0%]). Safety data were similar to the known capecitabine safety profile and generally comparable between arms. CONCLUSION Capecitabine when added to 3 cycles of docetaxel followed by 3 cycles of a 3-drug anthracycline combination containing capecitabine instead of fluorouracil significantly improved DFS in TNBC without new safety concerns."

Radioresistance and stemness are substantial obstacles to TNBC treatment. The THO complex (THOC) is a subunit of the TRanscription–EXport complex that functions in the coupling of transcription to nascent RNA splicing, elongation, and export. However, its role in regulating TNBC therapeutic resistance is not reported yet. In this study, the authors demonstrate that cancer stem cells are enriched in radioresistant TNBC cells and describe the role of the THOC in regulating TNBC radioresistance and stemness. The authors find that THOC2 and THOC5 are upregulated in radioresistant TNBC cells and associated with a poor prognosis in TNBC patients. Further investigation reveals that THOC2 promotes the stem‐like properties and radioresistance of TNBC cells in a THOC5‐dependent manner by facilitating the release of sex‐determining region Y (SRY)‐box transcription factor 2 (SOX2) and homeobox transcription factor (NANOG) transcripts from the nucleus. Silencing THOC2 or THOC5 expression decreases the protein expression of SOX2 and NANOG, depletes the stem‐like properties, and causes radiosensitization in these TNBC cells. Moreover, THOC2 or THOC5 depletion blocks the xenograft tumorigenesis and growth of radioresistant TNBC in vivo. These findings uncover the novel correlations of THOC with TNBC stemness and therapeutic resistance, proposing alternative therapeutic strategies against relapsed TNBC."

However, anti-breast cancer effects of carotenoids have been controversial, albeit understudied. Here, we investigated the effects of specific carotenoids on a wide range of breast cancer cell lines, and found that among several carotenoids (including β-carotene, lutein, and astaxanthin), lutein significantly inhibits breast cancer cell growth by inducing cell-cycle arrest and caspase-independent cell death, but it has little effect on the growth of primary mammary epithelial cells (PmECs). Moreover, lutein-mediated growth inhibition of breast cancer cells is quantitatively similar to that induced by chemotherapeutic taxanes, paclitaxel and docetaxel, and exposure to lutein plus taxanes additively inhibits breast cancer cell growth. Analysis of mechanisms showed that lutein treatment significantly increases the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, but not in normal PmECs. Lutein-induced growth inhibition is also attenuated by the radical oxygen scavenger N-acetyl cysteine, suggesting a role for ROS generation in the growth inhibitory effect of lutein on TNBC cells. Additionally, we found that the p53 signaling pathway is activated and HSP60 levels are increased by lutein treatment, which may contribute partly to the induction of growth inhibition in TNBC cells. Our findings show that lutein promotes growth inhibition of breast cancer cells through increased cell type-specific ROS generation and alternation of several signaling pathways. Dietary lutein supplementation may be a promising alternative and/or adjunct therapeutic candidate against breast cancer."

However, most solid tumors, such as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), do not have identifiable surface markers to distinguish themselves from normal cells, thus it is challenging to selectively identify and eliminate those malignances by PTT. In this report, we hypothesized that, by targeting CD44 (one TNBC-overexpressed surface molecule) and depleting heat shock protein 72 (HSP72, one malignancy-specific-overexpressed thermotolerance-related chaperone) subsequently, the TNBC could be selectively sensitized to PTT and improve the accuracy of treatment. To this end, a rationally designed nanosystem gold nanostar (GNS)/siRNA against HSP72 (siHSP72)/hyaluronic acid (HA) was successfully constructed using a layer-by-layer method. Hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential analysis demonstrated the formation of GNS/siHSP72/HA having a particle size of 73.2 ± 3.8 nm and a negative surface charge of -18.3 ± 1.6 mV. The CD44-targeting ability of GNS/siHSP72/HA was confirmed by the flow cytometer, confocal microscopic imaging, and competitive binding analysis. The HSP72 silencing efficacy of GNS/siHSP72/HA was ∼95% in complete culture medium. By targeting CD44 and depleting HSP72 sequentially, GNS/siHSP72/HA could selectively sensitize TNBC cells to hyperthermia and enhance the therapeutic efficacy to TNBC with minimal side effect both in vitro and in vivo. Other advantages of GNS/siHSP72/HA included easy synthesis, robust siRNA loading capacity, endosome/lysosome escaping ability, high photothermal conversion efficacy and superior hemo- and biocompatibility."

This has been hypothesised to confer particular sensitivity to DNA-damaging platinum chemotherapy. The TNT trial, a randomized phase III trial in women with metastatic or recurrent locally advanced TNBC or BRCA1/2 mutation-associated breast cancer, aimed to test this hypothesis and examine treatment effect in biological subgroups. Patients & Methods: Eligible patients had either ER-, PR-, HER2- breast cancer or were known BRCA1/2 carriers (any ER/PR/HER2). Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either C (AUC 6 q3wk) or D (100mg/m2 q3wk) for 6-8 cycles or until disease progression if sooner and could cross over to the alternative treatment on confirmed progression. Ineligible patients included those who had ECOG performance status >2, received adjuvant taxane therapy in the last 12 mths, any previous treatment with a platinum chemotherapy, or previous non-anthracycline chemotherapy for metastatic disease. For consenting patients a blood sample and archived tissue samples were obtained for BRCA1/2 genotyping and central biomarker analysis (primary tumour, lymph nodes and recurrent tumour biopsy if available) of subtypes within TNBC and biomarkers of DNA repair deficiency. The primary endpoint was RECIST objective tumour response up to cycle 6 of randomised treatment. Secondary endpoints included toxicity, progression free survival (PFS), time to progression and overall survival. TNT aimed to detect a 15% improvement in ORR with C compared to D, with planned target sample size range of 370-450 depending on assumed ORR in D patients (2-sided α=0.05, power=90%). 376 (188 C, 188 D) were recruited from 74 UK centres between Apr 08 and Mar 14. Results: A snapshot of the data was taken on 30/5/14 at which point 336 (89.4%) patients had experienced a PFS event, with overall median PFS time of 4.4 mths. Median age of patients was 55 yrs (IQR 48-63). 366/376 (97%) patients had TNBC of whom 18 were also known BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, with the remaining 10 patients receptor +ve and BRCA1/2 carriers. 338/376 (90%) had metastatic and 38/376 (10%) recurrent locally advanced disease. 53% had liver or lung metastases affecting the parenchyma and 34% had received previous adjuvant taxane therapy. Median time from initial diagnosis to entering TNT was 2.2 yrs (IQR 1.5-3.5). Primary tumour tissue has currently been received for 277 patients, blood from 286 patients and recurrent tumour tissue from 85 patients. Discussion: TNT will report evidence on the activity of single agent platinum chemotherapy compared with single agent taxane in patients with TNBC and BRCA1/2 associated breast cancer. Correlative analyses of BRCA1/2 mutation status, subtypes and DNA repair biomarkers will also be reported. TNT will be the first randomised trial to report the activity of platinum compared with standard chemotherapy within TNBC subtypes and in relation to BRCA1/2 mutation status and DNA repair biomarkers. Safety, tolerability and response to crossover treatment will also be presented.

Possible Beneficial Effects of N-Acetylcysteine for Treatment of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,"[{'authorId': '7632463', 'name': 'Y. Kwon'}]",36,2021,c548902677eb71243da90a14475c35c9f06681e5,"N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a widely used antioxidant with therapeutic potential. However, the cancer-promoting effect of NAC observed in some preclinical studies has raised concerns regarding its clinical use. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can mediate signaling that results in both cancer-promoting and cancer-suppressing effects. The beneficial effect of NAC may depend on whether the type of cancer relies on ROS signaling for its survival and metastasis. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has aggressive phenotypes and is currently treated with standard chemotherapy as the main systemic treatment option. Particularly, basal-like TNBC cells characterized by inactivated BRCA1 and mutated TP53 produce high ROS levels and rely on ROS signaling for their survival and malignant progression. In addition, the high ROS levels in TNBC cells can mediate the interplay between cancer cells and the tissue microenvironment (TME) to trigger the recruitment and conversion of stromal cells and induce hypoxic responses, thus leading to the creation of cancer-supportive TMEs and increased cancer aggressiveness. However, NAC treatment effectively reduces the ROS production and ROS-mediated signaling that contribute to cell survival, metastasis, and drug resistance in TNBC cells. Therefore, the inclusion of NAC in standard chemotherapy could probably provide additional benefits for TNBC patients."

This is mainly due to the development of cancer chemoresistance accompanied by tumor recurrence. In this work, we investigated a new mechanism of acquired chemoresistance of TNBC cells. We showed that extracellular vehicles (EVs) of chemoresistant TNBC cells can transfer mitochondria to sensitive cancer cells, thus increasing their chemoresistance. Such transfer, but with less efficiency, can be carried out over short distances using tunneling nanotubes. In addition, we showed that exosome fractions carrying mitochondria from resistant TNBC cells contribute to acquired chemoresistance by increasing mtDNA levels with mutations in the mtND4 gene responsible for tumorigenesis.

The MUC1-C transmembrane oncoprotein is aberrantly overexpressed in TNBC and, like xCT, has been linked to maintaining glutathione (GSH) levels and redox balance. However, there is no known interaction between MUC1-C and xCT. Here we show that silencing MUC1-C is associated with decreases in xCT expression in TNBC cells. The results demonstrate that MUC1-C forms a complex with xCT and the CD44 variant (CD44v), which interacts with xCT and thereby controls GSH levels. MUC1-C binds directly with CD44v and in turn promotes stability of xCT in the cell membrane. The interaction between MUC1-C and xCT is further supported by the demonstration that targeting xCT with silencing or the inhibitor sulfasalazine suppresses MUC1 gene transcription by increasing histone and DNA methylation on the MUC1 promoter. In terms of the functional significance of the MUC1-C/xCT interaction, we show that MUC1-C protects against treatment with erastin, an inhibitor of XC− and inducer of ferroptosis, a form of non-apoptotic cell death. These findings indicate that targeting this novel MUC1-C/xCT pathway could represent a potential therapeutic approach for promoting TNBC cell death."

The purpose of this retrospective study was to find out the incidence of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in all kinds of breast cancers and to compare and analyze the clinicopathological features, recurrence, metastasis and prognosis of patients with TNBC and non-triple negative breast cancer (non-TNBC). Methods: A total of 1578 female patients with primary breast cancer were diagnosed and treated at the department of General Surgery, the Chinese PLA General Hospital, China, from Jan. 2004 to Jun. 2009. The 1578 breast cancer patients were divided into two groups: the TNBC group and the non-TNBC group. The clinical features and prognosis of the two groups were compared. Results: The incidence of TNBC was 20.41%. Compared with the non-TNBC, the TNBC were characterized as younger age, higher histological grade, higher rate of positive lymph node, bigger tumor size, higher clinical stage at diagnosis, higher histological grade, quicker and easier recurrence and metastasis and lower 5-year DFS rate and 5-year OS rate. The metastasis of TNBC had obvious organic tendency. The lungs, liver and brain were the first three most common sites of metastases. The information of age, the tumor size, lymph node status, clinical stage, histological grade, pathological types and operation method, especially the age and lymph node status play the important roles in judging the prognosis of TNBC. Conclusions: According to this study we found that TNBC was a distinct subgroup of breast cancer with particular clinicopathologic behavior. Compared with the non-TNBC, TNBC was characterized by more aggressive behavior, and lower DFS and OS rate. The metastasis of TNBC had obvious organic tendency. The information of age, the maximum diameter of the tumor, lymph node status, clinical stage, histological grade, pathological types and operation method, especially the age and lymph node status played the important roles in judging the prognosis of TNBC patients."

Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) do not express HER2 or the receptors for estrogen or progesterone, and so often have a poor prognosis. Tumor-infiltrating T cells have been well-characterized in TNBC, and increased numbers are associated with better outcomes; however, the potential roles of B cells and plasma cells have been large. Here, we conducted a retrospective correlative study on the expression of B cell/plasma cell-related genes, and the abundance and localization of B cells and plasma cells within TNBCs, and clinical outcome. We analyzed 269 TNBC samples and used immunohistochemistry to quantify tumor-infiltrating B cells and plasma cells, coupled with NanoString measurement of expression of immunoglobulin metagenes. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients bearing TNBCs with above-median densities of CD38+ plasma cells had significantly better disease-free survival (DFS) (HR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.26–0.77; p = 0.004) but not overall survival (OS), after adjusting for the effects of known prognostic factors. In contrast, TNBCs with higher immunoglobulin gene expression exhibited improved prognosis (OS p = 0.029 and DFS p = 0.005). The presence of B cells and plasma cells was positively correlated (p < 0.0001, R = 0.558), while immunoglobulin gene IGKC, IGHM, and IGHG1 mRNA expression correlated specifically with the density of CD38+ plasma cells (IGKC p < 0.0001, R = 0.647; IGHM p < 0.0001, R = 0.580; IGHG1 p < 0.0001, R = 0.655). Interestingly, after adjusting the multivariate analysis for the effect of intratumoral CD38+ plasma cell density, the expression levels of all three genes lost significant prognostic value, suggesting a biologically important role of plasma cells. Last but not least, the addition of intratumoral CD38+ plasma cell density to clinicopathological features significantly increased the prognostic value for both DFS (ΔLRχ2 = 17.28, p = 1.71E−08) and OS (ΔLRχ2 = 10.03, p = 6.32E−08), compared to clinicopathological features alone. The best combination was achieved by integrating intratumoral CD38+ plasma cell density and IGHG1 which conferred the best added prognostic value for DFS (ΔLRχ2 = 27.38, p = 5.22E−10) and OS (ΔLRχ2 = 21.29, p = 1.03E−08). Our results demonstrate that the role of plasma cells in TNBC warrants further study to elucidate the relationship between their infiltration of tumors and disease recurrence."

Specifically, this work points toward the importance of properly packaging and presenting the adjuvant and antigens such that biodistribution, dendritic cell activation, and therapeutic efficacy can be controlled. Highly heterogenous cancers, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), remain challenging immunotherapeutic targets. Herein, we describe the synthesis and evaluation of immunotherapeutic liposomal spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) for TNBC therapy. The SNAs comprise immunostimulatory oligonucleotides (CpG-1826) as adjuvants and encapsulate lysates derived from TNBC cell lines as antigens. The resulting nanostructures (Lys-SNAs) enhance the codelivery of adjuvant and antigen to immune cells when compared to simple mixtures of lysates with linear oligonucleotides both in vitro and in vivo, and reduce tumor growth relative to simple mixtures of lysate and CpG-1826 (Lys-Mix) in both Py230 and Py8119 orthotopic syngeneic mouse models of TNBC. Furthermore, oxidizing TNBC cells prior to lysis and incorporation into SNAs (OxLys-SNAs) significantly increases the activation of dendritic cells relative to their nonoxidized counterparts. When administered peritumorally in vivo in the EMT6 mouse mammary carcinoma model, OxLys-SNAs significantly increase the population of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and simultaneously decrease the population of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) within the tumor microenvironment, when compared with Lys-SNAs and simple mixtures of oxidized lysates with CpG-1826. Importantly, animals administered OxLys-SNAs exhibit significant antitumor activity and prolonged survival relative to all other treatment groups, and resist tumor rechallenge. Together, these results show that the way lysates are processed and packaged has a profound impact on their immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, this work points toward the potential of oxidized tumor cell lysate-loaded SNAs as a potent class of immunotherapeutics for cancers lacking common therapeutic targets."

Notably, this goal is not far from reality: genetically similar cancers can be treated similarly. The heterogeneous nature of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) made it a suitable candidate to practice precision medicine. Using TNBC molecular subtyping and genomic profiling, a precision medicine-based clinical trial is ongoing. This review summarizes the current landscape and future directions of precision medicine and TNBC. Abstract Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and heterogeneous subtype of breast cancer associated with a high recurrence and metastasis rate that affects African-American women disproportionately. The recent approval of targeted therapies for small subgroups of TNBC patients by the US ‘Food and Drug Administration’ is a promising development. The advancement of next-generation sequencing, particularly somatic exome panels, has raised hopes for more individualized treatment plans. However, the use of precision medicine for TNBC is a work in progress. This review will discuss the potential benefits and challenges of precision medicine for TNBC. A recent clinical trial designed to target TNBC patients based on their subtype-specific classification shows promise. Yet, tumor heterogeneity and sub-clonal evolution in primary and metastatic TNBC remain a challenge for oncologists to design adaptive precision medicine-based treatment plans."

Breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSCs) in primary TNBCs are reported to be responsible for metastatic spread of the disease and resistance to chemotherapy, but no available therapeutic tools target BCSCs. We previously reported that the ganglioside GD2 is highly expressed on BCSCs and that inhibition of its expression hampers TNBC growth. We therefore hypothesized that the anti-GD2 antibody dinutuximab (ch14.18) targets GD2+ BCSCs and inhibits TNBC growth. Method To test our hypothesis, we first determined GD2 expression via immunohistochemistry in frozen primary tumor samples from patients with TNBC (n=89). Then, we examined the effects of dinutuximab on TNBC cell adhesion, migration, and mammosphere formation in vitro and on tumor growth in vivo using TNBC cell-line and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Results We found that GD2 was expressed in around 60% of primary TNBC tumors at variable levels and was associated with worse overall survival of patients with TNBC (p=0.002). GD2 was found to be expressed in tumors and stroma, but normal ducts and lobules in adjacent tissues have shown low or no GD2 staining, indicating that GD2 is potentially a novel biomarker for tumor and its microenvironment. Treatment with dinutuximab significantly decreased adhesion and migration of MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 TNBC cells. Moreover, dinutuximab treatment inhibited mTOR signaling, which has been shown to be regulated by GD2 in BCSCs. Dinutuximab also reduced tumor growth in nude mice bearing TNBC cell-line xenografts. Finally, dinutuximab in combination with activated natural killer cells inhibited tumor growth in a TNBC PDX model and improved overall survival of tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions Dinutuximab successfully eliminated GD2+ cells and reduced tumor growth in both in vivo models. Our data provide proof-of-concept for the criticality of GD2 in BCSCs and demonstrate the potential of dinutuximab as a novel therapeutic approach for TNBC."

Glutamine (Gln) is one such nutrient that is rapidly taken up by tumor cells to fulfill this increased metabolic demand. A vital step in the catabolism of glutamine is its conversion to glutamate by the mitochondrial enzyme glutaminase (GLS). This study has identified GLS a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer, specifically in the basal subtype that exhibits a deregulated glutaminolysis pathway. Using inducible shRNA mediated gene knockdown, we discovered that loss of GLS function in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines with a deregulated glutaminolysis pathway led to profound tumor growth inhibition in vitro and in vivo. GLS knockdown had no effect on growth and metabolite levels in non-TNBC cell lines. We rescued the anti-tumor effect of GLS knockdown using shRNA resistant cDNAs encoding both GLS isoforms and by addition of an α-ketoglutarate (αKG) analog thus confirming the critical role of GLS in TNBC. Pharmacological inhibition of GLS with the small molecule inhibitor CB-839 reduced cell growth and led to a decrease in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity and an increase in the stress response pathway driven by activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Finally, we found that GLS inhibition synergizes with mTOR inhibition, which introduces the possibility of a novel therapeutic strategy for TNBC. Our study revealed that GLS is essential for the survival of TNBC with a deregulated glutaminolysis pathway. The synergistic activity of GLS and mTOR inhibitors in TNBC cell lines suggests therapeutic potential of this combination for the treatment of vulnerable subpopulations of TNBC."

The trial investigated the safety and efficacy of the AR-antagonist enzalutamide alone or in combination with the PI3K inhibitor taselisib in patients with metastatic AR+ (≥10%) breast cancer. Patients and Methods: Phase Ib patients [estrogen receptor positive (ER+) or TNBC] with AR+ breast cancer received 160 mg enzalutamide in combination with taselisib to determine dose-limiting toxicities and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Phase II TNBC patients were randomized to receive either enzalutamide alone or in combination with 4 mg taselisib until disease progression. Primary endpoint was clinical benefit rate (CBR) at 16 weeks. Results: The combination was tolerated, and the MTD was not reached. The adverse events were hyperglycemia and skin rash. Overall, CBR for evaluable patients receiving the combination was 35.7%, and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.4 months. Luminal AR (LAR) TNBC subtype patients trended toward better response compared with non-LAR (75.0% vs. 12.5%, P = 0.06), and increased PFS (4.6 vs. 2.0 months, P = 0.082). Genomic analyses revealed subtype-specific treatment response, and novel FGFR2 fusions and AR splice variants. Conclusions: The combination of enzalutamide and taselisib increased CBR in TNBC patients with AR+ tumors. Correlative analyses suggest AR protein expression alone is insufficient for identifying patients with AR-dependent tumors and knowledge of tumor LAR subtype and AR splice variants may identify patients more or less likely to benefit from AR antagonists."

This review summarizes the roles of miRNA and lncRNA in the progression, diagnosis, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy of TNBC. Aberrantly expressed miRNA and lncRNA are listed according to their roles. Further, it describes the multiple mechanisms that lncRNA shows for regulating gene expression in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and more importantly, describes lncRNA-regulated TNBC progression through complete combining with miRNA at the post-transcriptional level. Focusing on miRNA and lncRNA associated with TNBC can provide new insights for early diagnosis and treatment—they can be targeted in the future as a novel anticancer target of TNBC."

Here, we used the high prevalence of TP53 mutations in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) to compare ctDNA and CTC detection rates and prognostic value in metastatic TNBC patients. Forty patients were enrolled before starting a new line of treatment. TP53 mutations were characterized in archived tumor tissues and in plasma DNA using two next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms in parallel. Archived tumor tissue was sequenced successfully for 31/40 patients. TP53 mutations were found in 26/31 (84%) of tumor samples. The same mutation was detected in the matched plasma of 21/26 (81%) patients with an additional mutation found only in the plasma for one patient. Mutated allele fractions ranged from 2 to 70% (median 5%). The observed correlation between the two NGS approaches (R2 = 0.903) suggested that ctDNA levels data were quantitative. Among the 27 patients with TP53 mutations, CTC count was ≥1 in 19 patients (70%) and ≥5 in 14 patients (52%). ctDNA levels had no prognostic impact on time to progression (TTP) or overall survival (OS), whereas CTC numbers were correlated with OS (p = 0.04) and marginally with TTP (p = 0.06). Performance status and elevated LDH also had significant prognostic impact. Here, absence of prognostic impact of baseline ctDNA level suggests that mechanisms of ctDNA release in metastatic TNBC may involve, beyond tumor burden, biological features that do not dramatically affect patient outcome."

Current treatment options for patients with TNBC include a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and/or systemic chemotherapy. FDA-approved therapies that target DNA damage repair mechanisms in TNBC, such as PARP inhibitors, only provide marginal clinical benefit. The immunogenic nature of TNBC has prompted researchers to harness the body's natural immune system to treat this aggressive breast cancer. Clinical precedent has been recently established with the FDA approval of two TNBC immunotherapies, including an antibody–drug conjugate and an anti-programmed death-ligand 1 monoclonal antibody. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, a type of adoptive cell therapy that combines the antigen specificity of an antibody with the effector functions of a T cell, has emerged as a promising immunotherapeutic strategy to improve the survival rates of patients with TNBC. Unlike the remarkable clinical success of CAR-T cell therapies in hematologic cancers with Kymriah and Yescarta, the development of CAR-T cell therapies for solid tumors has been much slower and is associated with unique challenges, including a hostile tumor microenvironment. The aim of the present review is to discuss novel approaches and inherent challenges pertaining to CAR-T cell therapy for the treatment of TNBC."

It also has a distinct epidemiology. TNBCs are frequently of high histologic grade, typically more aggressive and difficult to treat than hormone receptor‐positive tumors, and they are associated with a higher risk of early relapse with visceral metastasis after surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. The lack of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 expression precludes the use of targeted therapies in advanced stages, and the only approved systemic treatment option is chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. In patients with advanced TNBC, responses to chemotherapy occur, but are often of short duration and it is associated with poor prognosis. The median overall survival for patients with metastatic TNBC is about 9–12 months with conventional cytotoxic agents. Given the suboptimal outcomes with chemotherapy, new targeted therapies for TNBC are urgently needed. This review summarizes the clinical efficacy, perspectives and future challenges of using new treatment options for metastatic TNBC, such as poly‐ADP‐ribose‐polymerase inhibitors, antiandrogen therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors (antiprogrammed death receptor‐1/PD‐L1 monoclonal antibodies)."

TNBC incidence is equally distributed across the age spectrum, affecting 10-15% of women in all age groups. Here we report that increased immune dysfunction with age limits ICB efficacy in aged TNBC-bearing mice. The tumor microenvironment in both aged mice and TNBC patients shows decreased interferon (IFN) signaling and antigen presentation, suggesting failed innate immune activation with age.

Using in vitro coincubation experiments with target cells and in vivo antitumor experiments in mice, we found that the coexpressed C7R can significantly improve the activation, cell proliferation, and cytotoxicity of CAR-T cells. In addition, the in vivo experiments suggested that the enhanced CAR-T cells displayed significant antitumor activity in a TNBC subcutaneous xenograft model, in which in vivo, the survival time of CAR-T cells was prolonged.

However, the relationship between tumor mutation burden (TMB) and immune infiltration and the prognosis of TNBC remains unclear. In this study, to explore the immunogenicity of TNBC, we divided patients with TNBC into high and low TMB groups based on the somatic mutation data of TNBC in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and screened out genes with mutation rate ≥10. Then, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that the 5-year survival rate of the high TMB group was much higher than that of the low TMB group and the two groups also showed differences in immune cell infiltration. Further exploration found that the FAT3 gene, which displays significant difference and a higher mutation rate between the two groups, is not only significantly related to the prognosis of TNBC patients but also exhibits difference in immune cell infiltration between the wild group and the mutant group of the FAT3 gene. The results of gene set enrichment analysis and drug sensitivity analysis further support the importance of the FAT3 gene in TNBC. This study reveals the characteristics of TMB and immune cell infiltration in triple-negative breast cancer and their relationship with prognosis, to provide new biomarkers and potential treatment options for the future treatment of TNBC. The FAT3 gene, as a risk predictor gene of TNBC, is considered a potential biological target and may provide new insight for the treatment of TNBC."

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) exhibits a high mortality rate and is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. As previous studies have shown that histone deacetylases (HDAC) may represent molecular targets for TNBC treatment, we screened a small library of synthetic molecules and identified a potent HDAC inhibitor (HDACi), YF438, which exerts effective anti-TNBC activity both in vitro and in vivo. Proteomic and biochemical studies revealed that YF438 significantly downregulated mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) expression. In parallel, loss of MDM2 expression or blocking MDM2 E3 ligase activity rendered TNBC cells less sensitive to YF438 treatment, revealing an essential role of MDM2 E3 ligase activity in YF438-induced inhibition of TNBC. Mechanistically, YF438 disturbed the interaction between HDAC1 and MDM2, induced the dissociation of MDM2-MDMX, and subsequently increased MDM2 self-ubiquitination to accelerate its degradation, which ultimately inhibited growth and metastasis of TNBC cells. In addition, analysis of clinical tissue samples demonstrated high expression levels of MDM2 in TNBC, and MDM2 protein levels closely correlated with TNBC progression and metastasis. Collectively, these findings show that MDM2 plays an essential role in TNBC progression and targeting the HDAC1–MDM2–MDMX signaling axis with YF438 may provide a promising therapeutic option for TNBC. Furthermore, this novel underlying mechanism of a hydroxamate-based HDACi in altering MDM2 highlights the need for further development of HDACi for TNBC treatment. Significance: This study uncovers the essential role of MDM2 in TNBC progression and suggests that targeting the HDAC1–MDM2–MDMX axis with a hydroxamate-based HDACi could be a promising therapeutic strategy for TNBC."

Ginsenoside Rg3 is a component of puffed ginseng and demonstrates anti-cancer activities. To explore the effect of CNTs-loaded Rg3 (Rg3-CNT) on the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling and the development of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Our data revealed that Rg3 inhibited the cell viability of TNBC cells, in which Rg3-CNT further enhanced this effect in the system. Similarly, the colony formation of TNBC cells was decreased by Rg3, while Rg3-CNT could reinforce its effect in the cells. Besides, the treatment of Rg3 induced apoptosis of TNBC cells, in which Rg3-CNT treatment further increased the phenotype in the cells. Remarkably, Rg3-CNT, but not Rg3, attenuated PD-L1 expression in TNBC cells. Rg3-CNT decreased the PD-L1 upregulation induced by interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in breast cancer cells. Importantly, Rg3-CNT was able to reduce PD-1 expression in activated T cells. Specifically, Rg3-CNT reduced the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in a T cell/triple-negative TNBC cell co-culture system. Moreover, the levels of IFN-γ, interleukins-2 (IL-2), interleukins-9 (IL-9), interleukins-10 (IL-10), interleukins-22 (IL-22), and interleukins-23 (IL-23) were significantly stimulated in the activated T cells, while the treatment of Rg3-CNT could reverse these phenotypes in the cells. Rg3-CNT attenuated the TNBC cell growth in vivo. The Rg3-CNT improved the anti-cancer effect of Rg3 toward TNBC by inhibiting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Our finding provides new insights into the mechanism by which Rg3-CNT attenuates the development of TNBC. Rg3-CNT may be applied as the potential therapeutic strategy for immunotherapy of TNBC."

This heterogeneity has limited the success of targeted therapy in unselected patients to date. Recent transcriptional analysis has divided TNBC into transcriptionally similar subtypes that may have different sensitivity to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and targeted therapy. At present, chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for early-stage and advanced TNBC; however, several actionable targets show promise in preclinical studies. Novel therapeutic strategies are currently being tested in phase II and phase III trials and will likely require patient stratification before therapy. Examples of these tailored approaches include poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors for BRCA-mutated TNBC, antiandrogens for androgen receptor (AR)-positive TNBC, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitors for TNBC harboring FGFR amplifications, and gamma-secretase inhibitors for TNBC with mutations in the PEST domain of NOTCH proteins. Treatment of TNBC based on molecular subsets represents a potential algorithm for the future. Well-designed clinical trials with incorporation of integrated biomarkers are necessary to advance the development of molecularly targeted therapy for different subgroups of TNBC."

On performing the in vitro MTT assay to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of Dox, Tan IIA and their combinations at different concentrations of the MDA-MB-231 cell line revealed the potential activity of Tan IIA compared to Dox, in addition to the confirmed synergistic effects of Dox/Tan IIA combinations on TNBC cell lines. Furthermore, the analysis of the gene expression profiles of PI3K, mTOR, and AKT as anti-apoptotic genes were examined in the MDA-MB-231 cell line after the treatment with the IC50 of Dox, Tan IIA, and their combination, and compared to the control using PCR. These results confirmed the synergistic effect of the Dox/Tan IIA combination that exceeded that of Dox alone."

However, treatment is currently mainly relying on chemotherapy as there are no targeted therapies specifically approved for TNBC. Despite initial responses to chemotherapy, resistance frequently and rapidly develops and metastatic TNBC has a poor prognosis. New targeted approaches are, therefore, urgently needed. Currently, bevacizumab, a monoclonal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A antibody, is the only targeted agent with an approval for the therapy of metastatic breast cancer, but does not provide a specific benefit in the TNBC subtype. This review discusses the current clinical developments in targeted approaches for TNBC, including anti-angiogenic therapies, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapies, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and platinum salts, as well as novel strategies using immune-checkpoint inhibitors, which have recently demonstrated first promising results. Strategies focusing on specific subtypes of TNBC like anti-androgenic therapies for the luminal androgen receptor subtype (LAR) and others are also discussed."

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer and lack of target. Therefore, chemotherapy is the only approved systemic treatment in TNBC. Here, we synthesized the calcium peroxide-modified magnetic nanoparticles (CaO2-MNPs) with the function of oxygen generation to improve and enhance the therapeutic efficiency of doxorubicin treatment in the hypoxia microenvironment of TNBC. CaO2-MNPs promoted ubiquitination and protein degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). Furthermore, CaO2-MNPs inhibited autophagy and induced apoptosis in TNBC cells. CaO2-MNPs in combination with doxorubicin showed a stronger tumor-suppressive effect on TNBC compared to the doxorubicin treatment alone in an orthotopic mouse model. Our findings suggest that combined with CaO2-MNPs and doxorubicin attenuates HIF-1α expression to improve the efficiency of chemotherapy in TNBC. Abstract Cancer response to chemotherapy is regulated not only by intrinsic sensitivity of cancer cells but also by tumor microenvironment. Tumor hypoxia, a condition of low oxygen level in solid tumors, is known to increase the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. Due to lack of target in TNBC, chemotherapy is the only approved systemic treatment. We evaluated the effect of hypoxia on chemotherapy resistance in TNBC in a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Furthermore, we synthesized the calcium peroxide-modified magnetic nanoparticles (CaO2-MNPs) with the function of oxygen generation to improve and enhance the therapeutic efficiency of doxorubicin treatment in the hypoxia microenvironment of TNBC. The results of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) software showed that the hypoxia and autophagy gene sets are significantly enriched in TNBC patients. We found that the chemical hypoxia stabilized the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) protein and increased doxorubicin resistance in TNBC cells. Moreover, hypoxia inhibited the induction of apoptosis and autophagy by doxorubicin. In addition, CaO2-MNPs promoted ubiquitination and protein degradation of HIF-1α. Furthermore, CaO2-MNPs inhibited autophagy and induced apoptosis in TNBC cells. Our animal studies with an orthotopic mouse model showed that CaO2-MNPs in combination with doxorubicin exhibited a stronger tumor-suppressive effect on TNBC, compared to the doxorubicin treatment alone. Our findings suggest that combined with CaO2-MNPs and doxorubicin attenuates HIF-1α expression to improve the efficiency of chemotherapy in TNBC."

Here, we exploit TNBC cells' overexpression of Notch-1 receptors and Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic proteins to provide an effective targeted therapy. Prior studies have shown that the small molecule drug ABT-737, which inhibits Bcl-2 to reinstate apoptotic signaling, is a promising candidate for TNBC therapy. However, ABT-737 is poorly soluble in aqueous conditions and its orally bioavailable derivative causes severe thrombocytopenia. To enable targeted delivery of ABT-737 to TNBC and enhance its therapeutic efficacy, we encapsulated the drug in poly(lactic co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (NPs) that were functionalized with Notch-1 antibodies to produce N1-ABT-NPs. The antibodies in this NP platform enable both TNBC cell-specific binding and suppression of Notch signaling within TNBC cells by locking the Notch-1 receptors in a ligand unresponsive state. This Notch inhibition potentiates the effect of ABT-737 by up-regulating Noxa, resulting in effective killing of TNBC cells. We present the results of in vitro studies that demonstrate N1-ABT-NPs can preferentially bind TNBC cells versus non-cancerous breast epithelial cells to effectively regulate Bcl-2 and Notch signaling to induce cell death. Further, we show that N1-ABT-NPs can accumulate in subcutaneous TNBC xenograft tumors in mice following systemic administration to reduce tumor burden and extend animal survival. Together, these findings demonstrate that nanoparticle-mediated co-delivery of Notch-1 antibodies and ABT-737 is a potent treatment strategy for TNBC that may improve patient outcomes with further development and implementation."

In this study, we showed that MIF suppressed tumor growth of the TNBC cell lines and patient-derived xenografts in NOD-SCID mice. Furthermore, MIF reduced the TNBC cancer stem cell (CSC) population through down-regulating KLF5 expression, a stem cell transcription factor over-expressed in basal type TNBC and promoting cell proliferation, survival and stemness. Interestingly, MIF suppresses the expression of KLF5 through inducing the expression of miR-153. Consistently, miR-153 decreases CSC and miR-153 inhibitor rescued MIF-induced down-regulation of the KLF5 protein level and CSC ratio. Taken together, our findings suggest that MIF inhibits basal TNBC via the miR-153/KLF5 axis and MIF may be used for the treatment of TNBC."

However, patients diagnosed with certain rare histomorphologic subtypes of TNBC have better prognosis than those diagnosed with typical triple negative breast cancer. In addition, with the discovery and development of novel treatment targets such as the androgen receptor (AR), PI3K/AKT/mTOR and AMPK signaling pathways, as well as emerging immunotherapies, the therapeutic options for TNBC are increasing. In this paper, we review the literature on various histological types of TNBC and focus on newly developed therapeutic strategies that target and potentially affect molecular pathways or emerging oncogenes, thus providing a basis for future tailored therapies focused on the mutational aspects of TNBC."

In the world about 1 million cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually and more than 170000 are triple-negative. Characteristic feature of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is that it lacks expression of oestrogen, progesterone and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2/neu receptors. They comprise 15%-20% of all breast cancers. We did a systematic review of PubMed and conference databases to identify studies published on biomarkers in TNBC. We included studies with biomarkers including: Epidermal growth factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor, c-Myc, C-kit and basal cytokeratins, Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, p53, tyrosinase kinases, m-TOR, heat and shock proteins and TOP-2A in TNBC. We also looked for studies published on synthetic lethality and inhibition of angiogenesis, growth, and survival pathways. TNBC is a complex disease subtype with many subclasses. Majority TNBC have a basal-like molecular phenotype by gene expression profiling. Their clinical and pathologic features overlap with hereditary BRCA1 related breast cancers. Management of these tumours is a challenge to the clinician because of its aggressive behaviour, poor outcome, and absence of targeted therapies. As the complexity of this disease is being simplified over time new targets are also being discovered for the treatment of this disease. There are many biomarkers in TNBC being used in clinical practice. Biomarkers may be useful as prognostic or predictive indicators as well as suggest possible targets for novel therapies. Many targeted agents are being studied for treatment of TNBC."

Because of the lack of therapeutic targets and limited treatment options, the prognosis for patients with TNBC remains the poorest of all patients with breast cancer. Here we report the synthesis and application of a novel CRISPR nanotherapeutic to effectively knock out Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), a breast cancer-promoting gene, in TNBC tumors via in vivo genome editing, leading to a significant suppression of TNBC tumor growth. Our studies demonstrate that CRISPR genome editing is a promising targeted gene therapy approach for TNBC. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which has the highest mortality rate of all breast cancer, is in urgent need of a therapeutic that hinders the spread and growth of cancer cells. CRISPR genome editing holds the promise of a potential cure for many genetic diseases, including TNBC; however, its clinical translation is being challenged by the lack of safe and effective nonviral delivery systems for in vivo therapeutic genome editing. Here we report the synthesis and application of a noncationic, deformable, and tumor-targeted nanolipogel system (tNLG) for CRISPR genome editing in TNBC tumors. We have demonstrated that tNLGs mediate a potent CRISPR knockout of Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), a known breast cancer oncogene, in human TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo. The loss of Lcn2 significantly inhibits the migration and the mesenchymal phenotype of human TNBC cells and subsequently attenuates TNBC aggressiveness. In an orthotopic TNBC model, we have shown that systemically administered tNLGs mediated >81% CRISPR knockout of Lcn2 in TNBC tumor tissues, resulting in significant tumor growth suppression (>77%). Our proof-of-principle results provide experimental evidence that tNLGs can be used as a safe, precise, and effective delivery approach for in vivo CRISPR genome editing in TNBC."

Identifying and engaging signaling pathways that regulate E-M/CSC plasticity within TNBC therefore remains an unmet critical clinical need. Recent evidence demonstrates that presence of E-M/CSC plasticity in TNBC correlates with a repressed interferon/STAT gene signature. Our data demonstrate that exogenous IFN-β targets and represses E-M/CSC plasticity by reengaging type I IFN signaling in CSC. Our findings have clinical relevance, as IFN-β signaling correlates with improved patient survival and repressed CSC in TNBC. Thus, our work suggests a therapeutic use for IFN-β in the repression of E-M/CSC–driven tumor recurrence and metastasis in TNBC. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the deadliest form of this disease, lacks a targeted therapy. TNBC tumors that fail to respond to chemotherapy are characterized by a repressed IFN/signal transducer and activator of transcription (IFN/STAT) gene signature and are often enriched for cancer stem cells (CSCs). We have found that human mammary epithelial cells that undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) following transformation acquire CSC properties. These mesenchymal/CSCs have a significantly repressed IFN/STAT gene expression signature and an enhanced ability to migrate and form tumor spheres. Treatment with IFN-beta (IFN-β) led to a less aggressive epithelial/non–CSC-like state, with repressed expression of mesenchymal proteins (VIMENTIN, SLUG), reduced migration and tumor sphere formation, and reexpression of CD24 (a surface marker for non-CSCs), concomitant with an epithelium-like morphology. The CSC-like properties were correlated with high levels of unphosphorylated IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (U-ISGF3), which was previously linked to resistance to DNA damage. Inhibiting the expression of IRF9 (the DNA-binding component of U-ISGF3) reduced the migration of mesenchymal/CSCs. Here we report a positive translational role for IFN-β, as gene expression profiling of patient-derived TNBC tumors demonstrates that an IFN-β metagene signature correlates with improved patient survival, an immune response linked with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and a repressed CSC metagene signature. Taken together, our findings indicate that repressed IFN signaling in TNBCs with CSC-like properties is due to high levels of U-ISGF3 and that treatment with IFN-β reduces CSC properties, suggesting a therapeutic strategy to treat drug-resistant, highly aggressive TNBC tumors."

This is observed despite its usual high sensitivity to chemotherapy. In the advanced setting, responses observed with chemotherapy lack durability. Early-stage clinical studies suggested impressive potential when a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor is given for the treatment of advanced TNBC with BRCA gene dysfunction.

In this regard, therapies targeting the CD44 receptor have drawn attention for more than a decade. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) modulate post-transcriptional gene regulation and thus, the correction of specific miRNA alterations using miRNA mimics or antagomiRs is an emerging strategy to normalize the genetic regulation in the tumor microenvironment. It has been acknowledged that miR-34a is downregulated and miR-10b is upregulated in TNBC, which promotes tumorigenesis and metastatic dissemination. However, there are a few barriers related to miRNA delivery. Herein, we have introduced tailored mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) for the co-delivery of miR-34a-mimic and antisense-miR-10b. MSN was functionalized with a cationic basic side chain and then loaded with the dual combination to overexpress miR-34a and downregulate miR-10b simultaneously. Finally, the loaded MSNs were coated with an hyaluronic acid-appended PEG-PLGA polymer for specific targeting. The cellular uptake, release profile, and subsequent effect in TNBC cells were evaluated. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated high specificity in TNBC tumor targeting, leading to efficient tumor growth inhibition as well as the retardation of metastasis, which affirmed the clinical application potential of the system."

BETting on combination treatment MYCN is a well-known oncogene that plays a role in cancer aggressiveness, but it is typically associated with neuroendocrine cancers. Schafer et al. found a role for MYCN in triple-negative breast cancer, a particularly aggressive form of the disease, and identified a potential intervention. Although there is no standard way to target MYCN directly, the authors determined that a group of experimental drugs called BET inhibitors are effective against triple-negative breast cancers that overexpress MYCN, especially when coupled with the inhibition of MEK, another known oncogene. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive form of breast cancer that does not respond to endocrine therapy or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–targeted therapies. Individuals with TNBC experience higher rates of relapse and shorter overall survival compared to patients with receptor-positive breast cancer subtypes. Preclinical discoveries are needed to identify, develop, and advance new drug targets to improve outcomes for patients with TNBC. Here, we report that MYCN, an oncogene typically overexpressed in tumors of the nervous system or with neuroendocrine features, is heterogeneously expressed within a substantial fraction of primary and recurrent TNBC and is expressed in an even higher fraction of TNBCs that do not display a pathological complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We performed high-throughput chemical screens on TNBC cell lines with varying amounts of MYCN expression and determined that cells with higher expression of MYCN were more sensitive to bromodomain and extraterminal motif (BET) inhibitors. Combined BET and MEK inhibition resulted in a synergistic decrease in viability, both in vitro and in vivo, using cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Our preclinical data provide a rationale to advance a combination of BET and MEK inhibitors to clinical investigation for patients with advanced MYCN-expressing TNBC."

Because they cannot be treated with targeted therapies, and many do not respond to chemotherapy, they represent a clinically underserved group. TNBC is characterized by reduced expression of metastasis suppressors such as Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP), which inhibits tumor invasiveness. Mechanisms by which metastasis suppressors alter tumor cells are well characterized; however, their ability to regulate the tumor microenvironment and the importance of such regulation to metastasis suppression are incompletely understood. Here, we use species-specific RNA sequencing to show that RKIP expression in tumors markedly reduces the number and metastatic potential of infiltrating tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). TAMs isolated from nonmetastatic RKIP(+) tumors, relative to metastatic RKIP(-) tumors, exhibit a reduced ability to drive tumor cell invasion and decreased secretion of prometastatic factors, including PRGN, and shed TNFR2. RKIP regulates TAM recruitment by blocking HMGA2, resulting in reduced expression of numerous macrophage chemotactic factors, including CCL5. CCL5 overexpression in RKIP(+) tumors restores recruitment of prometastatic TAMs and intravasation, whereas treatment with the CCL5 receptor antagonist Maraviroc reduces TAM infiltration. These results highlight the importance of RKIP as a regulator of TAM recruitment through chemokines such as CCL5. The clinical significance of these interactions is underscored by our demonstration that a signature comprised of RKIP signaling and prometastatic TAM factors strikingly separates TNBC patients based on survival outcome. Collectively, our findings identify TAMs as a previously unsuspected mechanism by which the metastasis-suppressor RKIP regulates tumor invasiveness, and further suggest that TNBC patients with decreased RKIP activity and increased TAM infiltration may respond to macrophage-based therapeutics."

Metabolic reprogramming in cancer is considered a hallmark of therapeutic relevance. Here, we report disruption of metabolic reprogramming in TNBC cells by silibinin via modulation of EGFR‐MYC‐TXNIP signaling. Metabolic assays combined with LC‐MS‐based metabolomics revealed inhibition of glycolysis and other key biosynthetic pathways by silibinin, to induce metabolic catastrophe in TNBC cells. Silibinin‐induced metabolic suppression resulted in decreased cell biomass, proliferation, and stem cell properties. Mechanistically, we identify EGFR‐MYC‐TXNIP as an important regulator of TNBC metabolism and mediator of inhibitory effects of silibinin. Highlighting the clinical relevance of our observations, the analysis of METABRIC dataset revealed deregulation of EGFR‐MYC‐TXNIP axis in TNBC and association of EGFRhigh‐MYChigh‐TXNIPlow signature with aggressive glycolytic metabolism and poor disease‐specific and metastasis‐free survival. Importantly, combination treatment of silibinin or 2‐deoxyglucose (glycolysis inhibitor) with paclitaxel synergistically inhibited proliferation of TNBC cells. Together, our results highlight the importance of EGFR‐MYC‐TXNIP axis in regulating TNBC metabolism, demonstrate the anti‐TNBC activity of silibinin, and argue in favor of targeting metabolic vulnerabilities of TNBC, at least in combination with mainstay chemotherapeutic drugs, to effectively treat TNBC patients."

Although the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene (RB1) is frequently lost together with TP53 in TNBC, it is not directly targetable. There is thus great interest in identifying vulnerabilities downstream of RB1 that can be therapeutically exploited. Here, we determined that combined inactivation of murine Rb and p53 in diverse mammary epithelial cells induced claudin-low-like TNBC with Met, Birc2/3-Mmp13-Yap1, and Pvt1-Myc amplifications. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that Rb/p53-deficient tumors showed elevated expression of the mitochondrial protein translation (MPT) gene pathway relative to tumors harboring p53 deletion alone. Accordingly, bioinformatic, functional, and biochemical analyses showed that RB1-E2F complexes bind to MPT gene promoters to regulate transcription and control MPT. Additionally, a screen of US Food and Drug Administration-approved (FDA-approved) drugs identified the MPT antagonist tigecycline (TIG) as a potent inhibitor of Rb/p53-deficient tumor cell proliferation. TIG preferentially suppressed RB1-deficient TNBC cell proliferation, targeted both the bulk and cancer stem cell fraction, and strongly attenuated xenograft growth. It also cooperated with sulfasalazine, an FDA-approved inhibitor of cystine xCT antiporter, in culture and xenograft assays. Our results suggest that RB1 deficiency promotes cancer cell proliferation in part by enhancing mitochondrial function and identify TIG as a clinically approved drug for RB1-deficient TNBC."

Recently, miRNA expression patterns have been identified as potential biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and personalized therapy. Here, we investigate a combination of candidate miRNAs as a clinically applicable signature that can precisely predict relapse in TNBC patients after surgery. Methods: Four total cohorts of training (TCGA_TNBC and GEOD-40525) and validation (GSE40049 and GSE19783) datasets were analyzed with logistic regression and Gaussian mixture analyses. We established a miRNA signature risk model and identified an 8-miRNA signature for the prediction of TNBC relapse. Results: The miRNA signature risk model identified ten candidate miRNAs in the training set. By combining 8 of the 10 miRNAs (miR-139-5p, miR-10b-5p, miR-486-5p, miR-455-3p, miR-107, miR-146b-5p, miR-324-5p and miR-20a-5p), an accurate predictive model of relapse in TNBC patients was established and was highly correlated with prognosis (AUC of 0.80). Subsequently, this 8-miRNA signature prognosticated relapse in the two validation sets with AUCs of 0.89 and 0.90. Conclusion: The 8-miRNA signature predictive model may help clinicians provide a prognosis for TNBC patients with a high risk of recurrence after surgery and provide further personalized treatment to decrease the chance of relapse."

Cancer cells exploit the unfolded protein response (UPR) to mitigate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress caused by cellular oncogene activation and a hostile tumor microenvironment (TME). The key UPR sensor IRE1α resides in the ER and deploys a cytoplasmic kinase–endoribonuclease module to activate the transcription factor XBP1s, which facilitates ER-mediated protein folding. Studies of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)—a highly aggressive malignancy with a dismal posttreatment prognosis—implicate XBP1s in promoting tumor vascularization and progression. However, it remains unknown whether IRE1α adapts the ER in TNBC cells and modulates their TME, and whether IRE1α inhibition can enhance antiangiogenic therapy—previously found to be ineffective in patients with TNBC. To gauge IRE1α function, we defined an XBP1s-dependent gene signature, which revealed significant IRE1α pathway activation in multiple solid cancers, including TNBC. IRE1α knockout in TNBC cells markedly reversed substantial ultrastructural expansion of their ER upon growth in vivo. IRE1α disruption also led to significant remodeling of the cellular TME, increasing pericyte numbers while decreasing cancer-associated fibroblasts and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Pharmacologic IRE1α kinase inhibition strongly attenuated growth of cell line–based and patient-derived TNBC xenografts in mice and synergized with anti-VEGFA treatment to cause tumor stasis or regression. Thus, TNBC cells critically rely on IRE1α to adapt their ER to in vivo stress and to adjust the TME to facilitate malignant growth. TNBC reliance on IRE1α is an important vulnerability that can be uniquely exploited in combination with antiangiogenic therapy as a promising new biologic approach to combat this lethal disease. Significance: Pharmacologic IRE1α kinase inhibition reverses ultrastructural distension of the ER, normalizes the tumor vasculature, and remodels the cellular TME, attenuating TNBC growth in mice."

Thus, there is an unmet medical need to develop new treatment regimen(s) for TNBC patients. An oncolytic herpes simplex virus encoding a master anti-tumor cytokine, interleukin 12, (designated G47Δ-mIL12) selectively kills cancer cells while inducing anti-tumor immunity. G47Δ-mIL12 efficiently infected and killed murine (4T1 and EMT6) and human (HCC1806 and MDA-MB-468) mammary tumor cells in vitro. In vivo in the 4T1 syngeneic TNBC model, it significantly reduced primary tumor burden and metastasis, both at early and late stages of tumor development. The virus-induced local and abscopal effects were confirmed by significantly increased infiltration of CD45+ leukocytes and CD8+ T cells, and reduction of granulocytic and monocytic MDSCs in tumors, both treated and untreated contralateral, and in the spleen. Significant trafficking of dendritic cells (DCs) were only observed in spleens of virus-treatment group, indicating that DCs are primed and activated in the tumor-microenvironment following virotherapy, and trafficked to lymphoid organs for activation of immune cells, such as CD8+ T cells. DC priming/activation could be associated with virally enhanced expression of several antigen processing/presentation genes in the tumor microenvironment, as confirmed by NanoString gene expression analysis. Besides DC activation/priming, G47Δ-mIL12 treatment led to up-regulation of CD8+ T cell activation markers in the tumor microenvironment and inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. The anti-tumor effects of G47Δ-mIL12 treatment were CD8-dependent. These studies illustrate the ability of G47Δ-mIL12 to immunotherapeutically treat TNBC."

A growing body of literature supports the role of the stem cell renewal Hedgehog (Hh) pathway in breast cancer. Emerging preclinical data also implicate Hh signaling in TNBC pathogenesis.

We describe two preclinical spontaneously metastatic TNBC orthotopic murine models for the development of advanced therapeutics: an immunodeficient human MDA‐MB‐231‐Luc model and an immunocompetent mouse 4T1 model. Furthermore, we provide a broad range of multifactorial analysis for both models that could provide relevant information for the development of new therapies and diagnostic tools. Our comparisons uncovered differential growth rates, stromal arrangements and metabolic profiles in primary tumors, and the presence of cancer‐associated adipocyte infiltration in the MDA‐MB‐231‐Luc model. Histopathological studies highlighted the more rapid metastatic spread to the lungs in the 4T1 model following a lymphatic route, while we observed both homogeneous (MDA‐MB‐231‐Luc) and heterogeneous (4T1) metastatic spread to axillary lymph nodes. We encountered unique metabolomic signatures in each model, including crucial amino acids and cell membrane components. Hematological analysis demonstrated severe leukemoid and lymphoid reactions in the 4T1 model with the partial reestablishment of immune responses in the immunocompromised MDA‐MB‐231‐Luc model. Additionally, we discovered β‐immunoglobulinemia and increased basal levels of G‐CSF correlating with a metastatic switch, with G‐CSF also promoting extramedullary hematopoiesis (both models) and causing hepatosplenomegaly (4T1 model). Overall, we believe that the characterization of these preclinical models will foster the development of advanced therapeutic strategies for TNBC treatment, especially for the treatment of patients presenting both, primary tumors and metastatic spread."

The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathways function in numerous developmental processes, and alterations in both are linked with a number of common pathological diseases. Overexpression of IGF1R and FAK are closely associated with metastatic breast tumors. The present study investigated the interrelationship between IGF1R and FAK signaling in regulating the malignant properties of TNBC cells. Using small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated IGF1R silencing methods, we showed that IGF1R is essential for sustaining mesenchymal morphologies of TNBC cells and modulates the expression of EMT-related markers. We further showed that IGF1R overexpression promotes migratory and invasive behaviors of TNBC cell lines. Most importantly, IGF1R-driven migration and invasion is predominantly mediated by FAK activation and can be suppressed using pharmacological inhibitors of FAK. Our findings in TNBC cells demonstrate a novel role of the IGF1R/FAK signaling pathway in regulating critical processes involved in the metastatic cascade. These results may improve the current understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms of TNBC metastasis and provide a strong rationale for co-targeting of IGF1R and FAK as therapy for mesenchymal TNBCs."

Our bioinformatics analysis demonstrates a unique alternative splicing pattern in TNBC compared with those of other breast cancers. In analyzing the underlying mechanism of the distinct alternative splicing profile, TDP43, a critical gene previously implicated in neurodegenerative disease, is found to promote TNBC progression. Mechanistically, TDP43 regulates extensive alternative splicing events, including downstream gene PAR3, by forming a complex with SRSF3 to regulate alternative splicing events coordinately. Splicing factors TDP43 and SRSF3, which are likely responsible for the unique alternative splicing, could serve as potential targets for TNBC therapy. Aberrant alternative splicing has been highlighted as a potential hallmark of cancer. Here, we identify TDP43 (TAR DNA-binding protein 43) as an important splicing regulator responsible for the unique splicing profile in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Clinical data demonstrate that TDP43 is highly expressed in TNBC with poor prognosis. Knockdown of TDP43 inhibits tumor progression, including proliferation and metastasis, and overexpression of TDP43 promotes proliferation and malignancy of mammary epithelial cells. Deep sequencing analysis and functional experiments indicate that TDP43 alters most splicing events with splicing factor SRSF3 (serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3), in the regulation of TNBC progression. The TDP43/SRSF3 complex controls specific splicing events, including downstream genes PAR3 and NUMB. The effect of reduced metastasis and proliferation upon the knockdown of TDP43 or SRSF3 is mediated by the splicing regulation of PAR3 and NUMB exon 12, respectively. The TDP43/SRSF3 complex and downstream PAR3 isoform are potential therapeutic targets for TNBC."

Blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway through monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) appears to be a promising therapeutic strategy for TNBC patients. Avelumab is a human IgG1 anti-PD-L1 mAb being tested in clinical trials that may also trigger antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against cancer cells as an additional antitumor activity. In the present work, we studied in vitro Avelumab-mediated ADCC against a panel of TNBC cells with different PD-L1 expression using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or purified NK cells from healthy donors. We determined that Avelumab significantly enhanced NK-cell mediated cytotoxicity against TNBC cells and that tumor cells expressing higher levels of PD-L1 were more sensitive to Avelumab-mediated ADCC. IFN-γ treatment upregulated PD-L1 expression in tumor cells but had a variable impact on Avelumab-mediated ADCC, which could be related to the simultaneous effect of IFN-γ on the expression of NK cell ligands. Moreover, IL-2 and IL-15 stimulation of NK cells enhanced Avelumab-triggered cytokine production and degranulation along with increased lytic activity against tumor cells. Improving the treatment of TNBC remains still a considerable challenge. This in vitro study suggests that Avelumab-mediated ADCC, independently of the blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, could be a valuable mechanism for tumor cell elimination in TNBC. Avelumab combination with immunomodulators such as IL-15 or IL-2 could be taken into consideration to increase the therapeutic efficacy of Avelumab in TNBC."
New substituted quinoxalines inhibit triple-negative breast cancer by specifically downregulating the c-MYC transcription,"[{'authorId': '19852383', 'name': 'Ming-Hao Hu'}, {'authorId': '2112664676', 'name': 'Tian-Ying Wu'}, {'authorId': '2148353777', 'name': 'Qiong Huang'}, {'authorId': '5940052', 'name': 'Guangyi Jin'}]",78,2019,bc84dc8b0097eda3105ef961b9eaaa9792ef24c6,"Abstract Conventional chemotherapy remains the primary treatment option for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the current chemotherapeutic drugs have limited effects on TNBC, and often lead to serious side effects as well as drug resistance. Thus, more effective therapeutic options are sorely needed. As c-MYC oncogene is highly expressed during TNBC pathogenesis, inhibiting c-MYC expression would be an alternative anti-TNBC strategy. In this study, we designed and synthesized a serial of quinoxaline analogs that target c-MYC promoter G-quadruplex (G4), which is believed to be a repressor of c-MYC transcription. Among them, a difluoro-substituted quinoxaline QN-1 was identified as the most promising G4-stabilizing ligand with high selectivity to c-MYC G4 over other G4s, which is distinguished from many other reported ligands. Intracellular studies indicated that QN-1 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, repressed metastasis and inhibited TNBC cell growth, primarily due to the downregulation of c-MYC transcription by a G4-dependent mechanism. Notably, inhibition by QN-1 was significantly greater for c-MYC than other G4-driven genes. Cancer cells with c-MYC overexpression were more sensitive to QN-1, relative to normal cells. Furthermore, QN-1 effectively suppressed tumor growth in a TNBC mouse model. Accordingly, this work provides an alternative strategy for treating TNBC."

The present study sought to characterize the risk factors for distant metastasis of TNBC. Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was exploited to enroll patients diagnosed with TNBC from 2010 to 2015. The eligible patients were dichotomized into locoregional and distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Patients’ demographics and tumor features, and treatment were evaluated to identify the risk factors for distant metastasis of primary TNBC. The categorical variables were examined by chi-square tests. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the risk factors for distant metastasis. Breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by Kaplan–Meier plots with log-rank tests. Results: We collected 26863 patients with primary TNBC, 1330 (5.0%) of them presented with distant metastasis. In the univariate analysis, all the variables indicated statistical significance. The significant variables were subsequently enlisted into the multivariate logistic regression analysis. Age > 50, higher clinical stage T and N, and tumor size > 5 cm were independent risk factors for distant metastasis of primary TNBC. Moreover, higher clinical stage T and stage N were independent risk factors for bone metastasis of the patients. TNBC patients with either bone or visceral metastasis have poor survival, with brain metastasis worst of all, though the OS difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions: TNBC patients with larger age, higher clinical stage, larger tumor size were more predisposed to have distant metastasis. Great attention should be paid to the prognosis of these patients with distant metastasis."

Here, we have tested the prognostic value of nectin-4 expression and assessed the therapeutic efficiency of an anti-nectin 4 antibody drug conjugate (ADC) on localised and metastatic TNBC in vitro and in vivo. Materials and methods We analysed nectin-4/PVRL4 mRNA expression in 5673 invasive breast cancers and searched for correlations with clinicopathological features including metastasis-free survival (MFS). Immunohistochemistry was carried out in 61 TNBCs and in samples of primary TNBC Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDXs). An anti-nectin-4 antibody eligible for ADC was produced and tested in vitro and in vivo in localised and metastatic TNBC PDXs. Results High nectin-4/PVRL4 mRNA expression was associated with poor-prognosis features including the TN and basal subtypes. High PVRL4 mRNA expression showed independent negative prognostic value for MFS in multivariate analysis in TNBCs. Nectin-4 protein expression was not detected in adult healthy tissues including mammary tissue. Membranous protein expression was found in 62% of TNBCs, with strong correlation with mRNA expression. We developed an ADC (N41mab-vcMMAE) comprising a human anti-nectin-4 monoclonal antibody conjugated to monomethyl auristatin-E (MMAE). In vitro, this ADC bound to nectin-4 with high affinity and specificity and induced its internalisation as well as dose-dependent cytotoxicity on nectin-4-expressing breast cancer cell lines. In vivo, this ADC induced rapid, complete and durable responses on nectin-4-positive xenograft TNBC samples including primary tumours, metastatic lesions, and local relapses; efficiency was dependent on both the dose and the nectin-4 tumour expression level. Conclusion Nectin-4 is both a new promising prognostic biomarker and specific therapeutic target for ADC in the very limited armamentarium against TNBC."

Pembrolizumab is a highly selective, humanized IgG4/kappa isotype mAb designed to block PD-1 interaction with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby reactivating the immune system to eradicate tumors. Methods: This is a multi-center, non-randomized trial of single agent MK-3475 treatment given intravenously at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, in patients with recurrent/metastatic triple-negative (ER, PR, and HER2 negative) breast cancer (TNBC). PD-L1 expression in tumor or stroma was required for study entry. PD-L1 status was determined by immunohistochemical analysis of patient’s tumor tissues using the Merck proprietary 22C3 antibody. Primary objectives of this study were to determine the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of MK-3475 in patients with PD-L1 positive, advanced TNBC. Secondary objectives included assessments of progression-free survival, overall survival, and response duration. Adverse events (AEs) reported in any patient receiving at least 1 dose of study treatment were monitored and graded using NCI CTCAE v. 4.0. Radiographic imaging was obtained every 8 weeks and evaluated by both investigator and an independent radiologist to assess clinical responses as defined by RECIST 1.1. This study (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01848834) is being conducted in conformance with Good Clinical Practices. Results: A total of 32 female patients with a median age of 50.5 years (range 29 – 72 years) with PD-L1 positive, recurrent/metastatic TNBC were enrolled in the study. Most of these patients had received and progressed on multiple lines of therapy for advanced disease. A preliminary analysis of data collected as of 23May2014 indicates that 5 patients (15.6%) experienced at least one drug-related serious adverse event (SAE); each of 4 patients experienced one of the following: Grade 3 anemia, headache, aseptic meningitis or pyrexia, and a fifth patient experienced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with thrombocytopenia and decreased blood fibrinogen. The patient who experienced DIC died. Preliminary analysis of data collected from investigators as of 23May2014 indicates that no patient had a complete response, 16.1% of patients had a partial response, 9.7% had stable disease, and 64.5% had progressive disease. As of 23May2014, all but one of the responders, in addition to three patients with stable disease, remain on treatment. Conclusion: This is the first report of clinical activity of an immune checkpoint inhibitor in TNBC. The preliminary results from this study suggest that single agent MK-3475 is a well-tolerated and effective treatment with significant therapeutic activity in a subset of heavily pre-treated patients with recurrent/metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.

Silencing β3 Integrin by Targeted ECO/siRNA Nanoparticles Inhibits EMT and Metastasis of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.,"[{'authorId': '6468144', 'name': 'Jenny G.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subcategory of breast cancer and currently lacks well-defined molecular targets for effective targeted therapies. Disease relapse, metastasis, and drug resistance render standard chemotherapy ineffective in the treatment of TNBC. Because previous studies coupled β3 integrin (ITGB3) to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis, we exploited β3 integrin as a therapeutic target to treat TNBC by delivering β3 integrin siRNA via lipid ECO-based nanoparticles (ECO/siβ3). Treatment of TNBC cells with ECO/siβ3 was sufficient to effectively silence β3 integrin expression, attenuate TGFβ-mediated EMT and invasion, restore TGFβ-mediated cytostasis, and inhibit three-dimensional organoid growth. Modification of ECO/siβ3 nanoparticles with an RGD peptide via a PEG spacer enhanced siRNA uptake by post-EMT cells. Intravenous injections of RGD-targeted ECO/siβ3 nanoparticles in vivo alleviated primary tumor burden and, more importantly, significantly inhibited metastasis. In the span of 16 weeks of the experiments and observations, including primary tumor resection at week 9 and release from the treatment for 4 weeks, the mice bearing orthotopic, TGFβ-prestimulated MDA-MB-231 tumors that were treated with RGD-targeted ECO/siβ3 nanoparticles were free of metastases and relapse, in comparison with untreated mice. Collectively, these results highlight ECO/siβ3 nanoparticles as a promising therapeutic regimen to combat TNBC."

However, the triple negative subgroup of breast cancer (TNBC) (estrogen-, progesterone- and HER2-receptor negative) still lacks targeted treatment options. TNBC is a type of breast cancer that often affects younger women, and generally has a worse prognosis than other types of breast cancer. Recently, the complex role of the immune system in cancer growth, elimination and metastasis has been the object of increased attention. There is hope that a more detailed understanding of the intricate roles of the constituents of the immune system, will hold potential both as prognostic or predictive markers of cancer progression, but also as treatment targets for a wide range of tumors, including TNBC. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the cellular immune microenvironment in TNBC, and to highlight areas in which TNBC may differ from other types of breast cancer. Material and methods: A search of PubMed was made using the terms ‘triple negative breast cancer’ and ‘tumor infiltrating lymphocytes’, ‘CD8’, ‘CD4’, ‘B cells’, ‘natural killer cells’, ‘macrophages’, myeloid derived suppressor cells’, ‘dendritic cells’, ‘immune check point inhibitor’, ‘CTLA-4’ and ‘PD-L1’. Results: We find that whilst factors such as TILs and certain subgroups of TILs (e.g., CD8 + and regulator T-cells) have been extensively researched, none of these markers are currently applicable to routine clinical practice. Also, TNBC differs from other types of breast cancer with regards to cellular composition of the immune infiltrate and PD-L1 expression, and the prognostic significance of these. Conclusions: Immune-related factors have the potential as both prognostic and predictive biomarkers for new treatments targeting the immune system in breast cancer. However, multivariate analyses, taking other well-known factors into account, are required to determine the true value of these biomarkers. Also, differences between TNBC and other types of breast cancer may have implications for treatment and use of immune-related factors as biomarkers."

There is new evidence to support the evaluation of cancer stem cells in TNBC for diagnostic purposes. Targeting cancer stem cells may also be a promising, novel strategy for the treatment of TNBC. This review highlights the current understanding of breast cancer stem cells in TNBC, with focus on CD44+/CD24- and ALDH1+ breast cancer stem cells.

These patients are often treated with primary systemic chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of BRCA1/2 mutations on pathologic complete response (pCR) and disease-free survival (DFS) in a cohort of patients with TNBC treated with anthracycline and taxane-containing chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab. Patients and Methods Germline DNA was sequenced to identify mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in 493 patients with TNBC from the GeparQuinto study. The pCR rates were compared in patients with and without mutation, as well as in patients treated with and without bevacizumab. In addition, the influence of BRCA1/2 mutation status and pCR status on DFS was evaluated relative to treatment. Results BRCA1/2 mutations were detected in 18.3% of patients with TNBC. Overall, patients with mutations had a pCR rate of 50%, compared with 31.5% in patients without a mutation (odds ratio [OR], 2.17; 95% CI, 1.37 to 3.46; P = .001). The pCR rate among patients treated with bevacizumab was 61.5% for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and 35.6% for those without mutations (OR, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.43 to 5.89; P = .004). pCR was a strong predictor of DFS for patients without BRCA1/2 mutations (hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.31) but not for patients with BRCA1/2 mutations (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.32 to 1.69). Conclusion The addition of bevacizumab may increase the pCR after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with TNBC with BRCA1/2 mutations. In patients treated with anthracycline and taxane-based chemotherapy (with or without bevacizumab), pCR was a weaker predictor of DFS for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers than for patients without mutations."

One of the key reasons for the failure to develop a new therapy for this subgroup of breast cancer patients has been the difficulty in identifying a highly prevalent, targetable molecular alteration in these tumors. Recently however, the p53 gene was found to be mutated in approximately 80% of basal/TNBC, raising the possibility that targeting the mutant p53 protein product might be a new approach for the treatment of this form of breast cancer. In this study, we investigated the anti‐cancer activity of PRIMA‐1 and PRIMA‐1MET (APR‐246), two compounds which were previously reported to reactivate mutant p53 and convert it to a form with wild‐type (WT) properties. Using a panel of 18 breast cancer cell lines and 2 immortalized breast cell lines, inhibition of proliferation by PRIMA‐1 and PRIMA‐1MET was found to be cell‐line dependent, but independent of cell line molecular subtype. Although response was independent of molecular subtype, p53 mutated cell lines were significantly more sensitive to PRIMA‐1MET than p53 WT cells (p = 0.029). Furthermore, response (measured as IC50 value) correlated significantly with p53 protein level as measured by ELISA (p = 0.0089, r=−0.57, n = 19). In addition to inhibiting cell proliferation, PRIMA‐1MET induced apoptosis and inhibited migration in a p53 mutant‐dependent manner. Based on our data, we conclude that targeting mutant p53 with PRIMA‐1MET is a potential new approach for treating p53‐mutated breast cancer, including the subgroup with triple‐negative (TN) disease."

Previous preclinical models of chemoresistance in TNBC have suffered from a lack of clinical relevance. Using a single high dose chemotherapy treatment, we developed a novel MDA-MB-436 cell-based model of chemoresistance characterized by a unique and complex morphologic phenotype, which consists of polyploid giant cancer cells giving rise to neuron-like mononuclear daughter cells filled with smaller but functional mitochondria and numerous lipid droplets. This resistant phenotype is associated with metabolic reprogramming with a shift to a greater dependence on fatty acids and oxidative phosphorylation. We validated both the molecular and histologic features of this model in a clinical cohort of primary chemoresistant TNBCs and identified several metabolic vulnerabilities including a dependence on PLIN4, a perilipin coating the observed lipid droplets, expressed both in the TNBC-resistant cells and clinical chemoresistant tumors treated with neoadjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy. These findings thus reveal a novel mechanism of chemotherapy resistance that has therapeutic implications in the treatment of drug-resistant cancer. Implications: These findings underlie the importance of a novel morphologic–metabolic phenotype associated with chemotherapy resistance in TNBC, and bring to light novel therapeutic targets resulting from vulnerabilities in this phenotype, including the expression of PLIN4 essential for stabilizing lipid droplets in resistant cells."

Theoretically, PARP inhibitors (PARPi) eliminate tumor cells by disrupting DNA damage repair through either PARylation or the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. However, resistance to PARPi greatly hinders therapeutic effectiveness in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Owing to the high heterogeneity and few genetic targets in TNBC, there has been limited therapeutic progress in the past decades. In view of this, there is a need to circumvent resistance to PARPi and develop potential treatment strategies for TNBC. We present, herein, a review of the scientific progress and explore the mechanisms underlying PARPi resistance in TNBC. The complicated mechanisms of PARPi resistance, including drug exporter formation, loss of poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), HR reactivation, and restoration of replication fork stability, are discussed in detail in this review. Additionally, we also discuss new combination therapies with PARPi that can improve the clinical response in TNBC. The new perspectives for PARPi bring novel challenges and opportunities to overcome PARPi resistance in breast cancer."

However, the function and precise mechanism of the vast majority of circRNAs in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) occurrence and progression have not been clearly elucidated. In the current study, we identified and further investigated hsa_circ_0002453 (circRAD18) by analyzing our previous microarray profiling. Expression of circRAD18 was found significantly up-regulated in TNBC compared with normal mammary tissues and cell lines. CircRAD18 was positively correlated with T stage, clinical stage and pathological grade and was an independent risk factor for TNBC patients. We performed proliferation, colony formation, cell migration, apoptosis and mouse xenograft assays to verified the functions of circRAD18. Knockdown of circRAD18 significantly suppressed cell proliferation and migration, promoted cell apoptosis and inhibited tumor growth in functional and xenograft experiments. Though luciferase reporter assays, we confirmed circRAD18 acts as a sponge of miR-208a and miR-3164 and promotes TNBC progression through up-regulating IGF1 and FGF2 expression. Altogether, our research revealed the pivotal role of circRAD18-miR-208a/3164-IGF1/FGF2 axis in TNBC tumorigenesis and metastasis though the mechanism of competing endogenous RNAs. Thus, circRAD18 may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and potential target for TNBC treatment in the future."

Here, we report evidence highlighting the cell-cycle-related kinase CDK7 as a driver and candidate therapeutic target in TNBC. Using publicly available transcriptomic data from a collated set of TNBC patients (n = 383) and the METABRIC TNBC dataset (n = 217), we found CDK7 mRNA levels to be correlated with patient prognosis. High CDK7 protein expression was associated with poor prognosis within the RATHER TNBC cohort (n = 109) and the METABRIC TNBC cohort (n = 203). The highly specific CDK7 kinase inhibitors, BS-181 and THZ1, each downregulated CDK7-mediated phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II, indicative of transcriptional inhibition, with THZ1 exhibiting 500-fold greater potency than BS-181. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the survival of MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells relied heavily on the BCL-2/BCL-XL signaling axes in cells. Accordingly, we found that combining the BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitors ABT-263/ABT199 with the CDK7 inhibitor THZ1 synergized in producing growth inhibition and apoptosis of human TNBC cells. Collectively, our results highlight elevated CDK7 expression as a candidate biomarker of poor prognosis in TNBC, and they offer a preclinical proof of concept for combining CDK7 and BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitors as a mechanism-based therapeutic strategy to improve TNBC treatment.

Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) are considered the most aggressive type of breast cancer, for which no targeted therapy exists at the moment. These tumors are characterized by having a high degree of chromosome instability and often overexpress the spindle assembly checkpoint kinase TTK. To explore the potential of TTK inhibition as a targeted therapy in TNBC, we developed a highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of TTK, NTRC 0066-0.


RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The compound is characterized by long residence time on the target and inhibits the proliferation of a wide variety of human cancer cell lines with potency in the same range as marketed cytotoxic agents. In cell lines and in mice, NTRC 0066-0 inhibits the phosphorylation of a TTK substrate and induces chromosome missegregation. NTRC 0066-0 inhibits tumor growth in MDA-MB-231 xenografts as a single agent after oral application. To address the effect of the inhibitor in breast cancer, we used a well-defined mouse model that spontaneously develops breast tumors that share key morphologic and molecular features with human TNBC. Our studies show that combination of NTRC 0066-0 with a therapeutic dose of docetaxel resulted in doubling of mouse survival and extended tumor remission, without toxicity. Furthermore, we observed that treatment efficacy is only achieved upon co-administration of the two compounds, which suggests a synergistic in vivo effect. Therefore, we propose TTK inhibition as a novel therapeutic target for neoadjuvant therapy in TNBC."

Dual targeting of EGFR using one monoclonal antibody (mAb; cetuximab or panitumumab) and one tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI; gefitinib or erlotinib) is a potential therapeutic approach. We investigated the effect of these therapies in EGFR-expressing TNBC cell lines that do or do not harbor the main activating mutations of EGFR pathways. Cell lines were sensitive to EGFR-TKIs, whereas mAbs were active only in MDA-MB-468 (EGFR amplification) and SUM-1315 (KRAS and PTEN wild-type) cells. MDA-MB-231 (KRAS mutated) and HCC-1937 (PTEN deletion) cells were resistant to mAbs. The combined treatment resulted in a synergistic effect on cell proliferation and superior inhibition of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway in mAb-sensitive cells. The anti-proliferative effect was associated with G1 cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis. Sensitivity to therapies was characterized by induction of positive regulators and inactivation of negative regulators of cell cycle. These results suggest that dual EGFR inhibition might result in an enhanced antitumor effect in a subgroup of TNBC. The status of EGFR, KRAS and PTEN could be used as a molecular marker for predicting the response to this therapeutic strategy."

This study aims to examine the cytotoxic effects of CD and investigate the underlying mechanism in human TNBC cells. The results show that CD exhibits cytotoxicity by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in TNBC cells via modulation of Bcl-2, Bax, cyt-C, cleaved caspase-3, and PARP. We find that CD significantly increases expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin, while reciprocally decreasing expression of mesenchymal markers such as snail, slug, and vimentin in BT-549 cells. In parallel with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) reversal, CD down regulates invasion and migration of BT-549 cells. CD markedly reduces stability and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, accompanied with downregulation of β-catenin target genes. Using the TopFlash luciferase reporter assay, we reveal CD as a specific inhibitor of the Wnt3a-induced signaling. These results suggest the involvement of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the CD-induced EMT reversion of BT-549 cells. Notably, CD restores the glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) activity, required for β-catenin destruction via the proteasome-mediated system, by inhibiting the phosphorylation of GSK3β by Akt. These occurrences ultimately lead to the blockage of EMT and the invasion of TNBC cells. Further antitumor activity of CD was tested in 4T1 (TNBC cells) induced tumor and it was found that CD significantly inhibited the tumor volume at dose of 5 mg/kg-treated mice. © 2016 BioFactors, 43(2):152-169, 2017."

Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)-causing alterations have been reported in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We hypothesized that TNBCs with HRD alterations might be more sensitive to anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy and report on HRD status and BRCA1 promoter methylation (PM) as prognostic markers in TNBC patients treated with adjuvant doxorubicin (A) and cyclophosphamide (C) in SWOG9313.


Patients and methods
In total, 425 TNBC patients were identified from S9313. HRD score, tumor BRCA1/2 sequencing, and BRCA1 PM were carried out on DNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. Positive HRD status was defined as either a deleterious tumor BRCA1/2 (tBRCA) mutation or a pre-defined HRD score ≥42. Markers were tested for prognostic value on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) using Cox regression models adjusted for treatment assignment and nodal status.


Results
HRD status was determined in 89% (379/425) of cases. Of these, 67% were HRD positive (27% with tBRCA mutation, 40% tBRCA-negative but HRD score ≥42). HRD-positive status was associated with a better DFS [hazard ratio (HR) 0.72; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-1.00; P = 0.049] and non-significant trend toward better OS (HR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.48-1.03; P = 0.073). High HRD score (≥42) in tBRCA-negative patients (n = 274) was also associated with better DFS (HR = 0.64; 95% CI 0.43-0.94; P = 0.023) and OS (HR = 0.65; 95% CI 0.42-1.00; P = 0.049). BRCA1 PM was evaluated successfully in 82% (348/425) and detected in 32% of cases. The DFS HR for BRCA1 PM was similar to that for HRD but did not reach statistical significance (HR = 0.79; 95% CI 0.54-1.17; P = 0.25).


Conclusions
HRD positivity was observed in two-thirds of TNBC patients receiving adjuvant AC and was associated with better DFS. HRD status may identify TNBC patients who receive greater benefit from AC-based chemotherapy and should be evaluated further in prospective studies.

Distinguishing malignant cells from non-neoplastic ones is a major challenge in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) treatment. Here, we developed a complementary targeting strategy that uses precisely matched, multivalent ligand-receptor interactions to recognize and target TNBC tumors at the primary site and metastatic lesions. We screened a panel of cancer cell surface markers and identified intercellular adhesion molecule–1 (ICAM1) and epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) as optimal candidates for TNBC complementary targeting. We engineered a dual complementary liposome (DCL) that precisely complements the molecular ratio and organization of ICAM1 and EGFR specific to TNBC cell surfaces. Our in vitro mechanistic studies demonstrated that DCLs, compared to single-targeting liposomes, exhibited increased binding, enhanced internalization, and decreased receptor signaling. DCLs consistently exhibited substantially increased tumor targeting activity and antitumor efficacy in orthotopic and lung metastasis models, indicating that DCLs are a platform technology for the design of personalized nanomedicines for TNBC."

To modulate BRCA1 expression, we tested two different dietary components to find out if any would induce tumor suppressor genes. We detected that quercetin and curcumin dose‐dependently enhanced the BRCA1 expression. Further, a synergistic action of quercetin and curcumin was observed in modulating the BRCA1 level and in inhibiting the cell survival and migration of TNBC cell lines. Quercetin and curcumin appeared to induce BRCA1 promoter histone acetylation. Furthermore, BRCA1 knockdown induced cell survival and cell migration in ER + cells were significantly decreased by the combined treatment of quercetin and curcumin.

Compared with patients with hormone receptor positive or Her-2 positive breast cancer, patients with TNBC are more commonly young (age <50 years), African-American and have a higher incidence of BRCA1/2 mutations. The clinical course is frequently characterized by early relapse and poor overall survival. The TNBC phenotype is impervious to therapies commonly used in other breast cancer subtypes, including hormonal therapy and Her-2 receptor antagonism. Cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the only approved treatment. With its aggressive clinical course and paucity of effective treatment options, TNBC represents an unmet clinical need. This review will focus on updates of the biologic underpinnings of TNBC and the associated treatment advances. Recent findings Numerous advancements have been made toward understanding the biologic framework of TNBC. Gene expression profiling has revealed six clinically relevant subsets of TNBC. Further study has demonstrated a portion of TNBC exhibits a strong immune gene signature. Lastly, it is now appreciated that a subgroup of sporadic TNBC shares biologic characteristics with BRCA1/2-mutated breast cancer, notably homologous repair deficiency. Recent studies focus on incorporation of platinum salts and new combinations of conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Targeted agents, including poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors, antiangiogenic agents, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway inhibitors, and androgen antagonist are also being evaluated. Most recently, checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated a modest degree of activity in a subset of TNBC. Summary These discoveries are informing novel treatment paradigms and identification of correlative biomarkers in TNBC. Improved understanding of the biologic heterogeneity of TNBC is allowing for a more effective and individualized approach to treatment."

We hypothesized that intrinsic resistance to TORC1/2 inhibition is driven by cancer stem cell (CSC)-like populations that could be targeted to enhance the antitumor action of these drugs. Therefore, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which PI3K/mTOR inhibitors affect the stem-like properties of TNBC cells. Treatment of established TNBC cell lines with a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor or a TORC1/2 inhibitor increased the expression of CSC markers and mammosphere formation. A CSC-specific PCR array revealed that inhibition of TORC1/2 increased FGF1 and Notch1 expression. Notch1 activity was also induced in TNBC cells treated with TORC1/2 inhibitors and associated with increased mitochondrial metabolism and FGFR1 signaling. Notably, genetic and pharmacologic blockade of Notch1 abrogated the increase in CSC markers, mammosphere formation, and in vivo tumor-initiating capacity induced by TORC1/2 inhibition. These results suggest that targeting the FGFR-mitochondrial metabolism-Notch1 axis prevents resistance to TORC1/2 inhibitors by eradicating drug-resistant CSCs in TNBC, and may thus represent an attractive therapeutic strategy to improve drug responsiveness and efficacy."

However, there is little information on differentially expressed lncRNAs between TNBC and non-TNBC. We detected the expression levels of lncRNAs in TNBC and non-TNBC tissues separately. Then we analyzed the lncRNA expression signature of TNBC relative to non-TNBC, and found dysregulated lncRNAs participated in important biological processes though Gene Ontology and Pathway analysis. Finally, we validated these lncRNA expression levels in breast cancer tissues and cells, and then confirmed that 4 lncRNAs (RP11-434D9.1, LINC00052, BC016831, and IGKV) were correlated with TNBC occurrence through receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.

Wnt signaling is one of the important pathways in the cellular process; in TNBC it is aberrantly regulated, which leads to the progression and metastasis. In this study, we designed a therapeutic strategy using a combination of a low dose of paclitaxel and a Wnt signaling inhibitor (XAV939), and examined the effect of the paclitaxel-combined XAV939 treatment on diverse breast cancer lines including TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and BT549) and ER+ve cell lines (MCF-7 and T-47D). The combination treatment of paclitaxel (20 nM) and XAV939 (10 µM) exerted a comparable therapeutic effect on MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, BT549, MCF-7, and T-47D cell lines, relative to paclitaxel with a high dose (200 nM). The paclitaxel-combined XAV939 treatment induced apoptosis by suppressing Bcl-2 and by increasing the cleavage of caspases-3 and PARP. In addition, the in vivo results of the paclitaxel-combined XAV939 treatment in a mice model with the MDA-MB-231 xenograft further confirmed its therapeutic effect. Furthermore, the paclitaxel-combined XAV939 treatment reduced the expression of β-catenin, a key molecule in the Wnt pathway, which led to suppression of the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and angiogenic proteins both at mRNA and protein levels. The expression level of E-cadherin was raised, which potentially indicates the inhibition of EMT. Importantly, the breast tumor induced by pristane was significantly reduced by the paclitaxel-combined XAV939 treatment. Overall, the paclitaxel-combined XAV939 regimen was found to induce apoptosis and to inhibit Wnt signaling, resulting in the suppression of EMT and angiogenesis. For the first time, we report that our combination approach using a low dose of paclitaxel and XAV939 could be conducive to treating TNBC and an external carcinogen-induced breast cancer."

Thus, there is a critical need to develop new therapeutic agents that can effectively eliminate drug-resistant CSCs and improve the efficacy of cancer therapy. Here, we report that Triptolide (C1572), a small-molecule natural product, selectively depletes CSCs in a dose-dependent fashion in human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines. Nanomolar concentrations of C1572 markedly reduced c-MYC (MYC) protein levels via a proteasome-dependent mechanism. Silencing MYC expression phenocopied the CSC depletion effects of C1572 and induced senescence in TNBC cells. Limited dilution assays revealed that ex vivo treatment of TNBC cells with C1572 reduced CSC levels by 28-fold. In mouse xenograft models of human TNBC, administration of C1572 suppressed tumor growth and depleted CSCs in a manner correlated with diminished MYC expression in residual tumor tissues. Together, these new findings provide a preclinical proof of concept defining C1572 as a promising therapeutic agent to eradicate CSCs for drug-resistant TNBC treatment.

Monotherapy with prexasertib demonstrated modest activity in BRCA wild-type, recurrent triple-negative breast cancer, highlighting the unmet need for combination treatment strategies. Neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia are common with the use of prexasertib but are manageable with supportive care measures. Prophylactic use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor should be considered to avoid dose reductions or treatment delays. Pharmacodynamic studies showed prexasertib treatment induced DNA damage in peripheral immune cells.


BACKGROUND
Cell cycle checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) is a major G2/M cell cycle regulator in tumors with p53 dysfunction, like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We hypothesized the second-generation CHK1 inhibitor, prexasertib, would yield clinical activity in sporadic TNBC.


METHODS
This single arm, phase II trial evaluated prexasertib at 105 mg/m2 IV every 2 weeks in patients with metastatic/recurrent TNBC. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR).


RESULTS
All nine patients enrolled were germline BRCA wild-type (BRCAwt) and had at least one prior treatment. One partial response (PR) was observed (ORR of 11.1%). Four patients experienced stable disease. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 86 days (range 17 to 159 days). Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events included afebrile neutropenia (n = 8; 88.9%), anemia (n = 3; 33.3%), and thrombocytopenia (n = 1; 11.1%). Pharmacodynamic studies showed prexasertib treatment induced DNA damage in peripheral immune cells and demonstrated decreased activated/reinvigorated CD8 T cells; however, the patient with a PR did show evidence of T-cell recovery.


CONCLUSION
Prexasertib monotherapy had modest clinical efficacy in BRCAwt TNBC. Further studies of the prexasertib in combination with other agents are needed."

Mounting evidence has supported the anti-cancer effects of amygdalin. However, whether amygdalin indeed acts as an anti-tumor agent against breast cancer cells is not clear. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of amygdalin on the proliferation of human breast cancer cells. Here, we show that amygdalin exerted cytotoxic activities on estrogen receptors (ER)-positive MCF7 cells, and MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Amygdalin induced apoptosis of Hs578T TNBC cells. Amygdalin downregulated B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), upregulated Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), activated of caspase-3 and cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). Amygdalin activated a pro-apoptotic signaling molecule p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK) in Hs578T cells. Treatment of amygdalin significantly inhibited the adhesion of Hs578T cells, in which integrin α5 may be involved. Taken together, this study demonstrates that amygdalin induces apoptosis and inhibits adhesion of breast cancer cells. The results suggest a potential application of amygdalin as a chemopreventive agent to prevent or alleviate progression of breast cancer, especially TNBC."

Experimental Design: Expression microarrays, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting were used to assess MELK RNA and protein expression levels. Clonogenic survival assays were used to quantitate the radiosensitivity of cell lines at baseline and after MELK inhibition. The effect of MELK knockdown on DNA damage repair kinetics was determined using γH2AX staining. The in vivo effect of MELK knockdown on radiosensitivity was performed using mouse xenograft models. Kaplan–Meier analysis was used to estimate local control and survival information, and a Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to identify potential factors impacting local recurrence-free survival. Results: MELK expression is significantly elevated in breast cancer tissues compared with normal tissue as well as in TNBC compared with non-TNBC. MELK RNA and protein expression is significantly correlated with radioresistance in breast cancer cell lines. Inhibition of MELK (genetically and pharmacologically) induces radiation sensitivity in vitro and significantly delayed tumor growth in vivo in multiple models. Kaplan–Meier survival and multivariable analyses identify increasing MELK expression as being the strongest predictor of radioresistance and increased local recurrence in multiple independent datasets. Conclusions: Here, we identify MELK as a potential biomarker of radioresistance and target for radiosensitization in TNBC. Our results support the rationale for developing clinical strategies to inhibit MELK as a novel target in TNBC. Clin Cancer Res; 22(23); 5864–75. ©2016 AACR."

In this study, we examined the utility of [18F](2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine ([18F]4F-Gln) PET to measure tumor cellular glutamine pool size, whose change might reveal the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of drugs targeting this cancer-specific metabolic pathway. High glutaminase (GLS) activity in TNBC tumors resulted in low cellular glutamine pool size assayed via high-resolution 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). GLS inhibition significantly increased glutamine pool size in TNBC tumors. MCF-7 tumors, with inherently low GLS activity compared with TNBC, displayed a larger baseline glutamine pool size that did not change as much in response to GLS inhibition. The tumor-to-blood-activity ratios (T/B) obtained from [18F]4F-Gln PET images matched the distinct glutamine pool sizes of both tumor models at baseline. After a short course of GLS inhibitor treatment, the T/B values increased significantly in TNBC, but did not change in MCF-7 tumors. Across both tumor types and after GLS inhibitor or vehicle treatment, we observed a strong positive correlation between T/B values and tumor glutamine pool size measured using MRS (r2 = 0.71). In conclusion, [18F]4F-Gln PET tracked cellular glutamine pool size in breast cancers with differential GLS activity and detected increases in cellular glutamine pool size induced by GLS inhibitors.

Methods Patients eligible for the open-label randomized phase III BEATRICE trial had centrally confirmed triple-negative operable primary invasive breast cancer (pT1a–pT3). Investigators selected anthracycline- and/or taxane-based chemotherapy for each patient. After definitive surgery, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive ≥4 cycles of chemotherapy alone or with 1 year of bevacizumab (5 mg/kg/week equivalent). Stratification factors were nodal status, selected chemotherapy, hormone receptor status, and type of surgery. The primary end point was invasive disease-free survival (IDFS; previously reported). Secondary outcome measures included overall survival (OS) and safety. Results After 56 months’ median follow-up, 293 of 2591 randomized patients had died. There was no statistically significant difference in OS between treatment arms in either the total population (hazard ratio 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74–1.17; P = 0.52) or pre-specified subgroups. The 5-year OS rate was 88% (95% CI 86–90%) in both treatment arms. Updated IDFS results were consistent with the primary IDFS analysis. Five-year IDFS rates were 77% (95% CI 75–79%) with chemotherapy alone versus 80% (95% CI 77–82%) with bevacizumab. From 18 months after first study dose to study end, new grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 4.6% and 4.5% of patients in the two arms, respectively. Conclusion Final OS results showed no significant benefit from bevacizumab therapy for early TNBC. Late-onset toxicities were rare in both groups. Five-year OS and IDFS rates suggest that the prognosis for patients with TNBC is better than previously thought. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00528567"

Here, a terpolymer‐lipid hybrid nanoparticle (TPLN) system is designed with multiple targeting moieties to first undergo synchronized BBB crossing and then actively target TNBC cells and TAMs in microlesions of brain metastases. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that covalently bound polysorbate 80 in the terpolymer enables the low‐density lipoprotein receptor‐mediated BBB crossing and TAM‐targetability of the TPLN. Conjugation of cyclic internalizing peptide (iRGD) enhances cellular uptake, cytotoxicity, and drug delivery to brain metastases of integrin‐overexpressing TNBC cells. iRGD‐TPLN with coloaded doxorubicin (DOX) and mitomycin C (MMC) (iRGD‐DMTPLN) exhibits higher efficacy in reducing metastatic burden and TAMs than nontargeted DMTPLN or a free DOX/MMC combination. iRGD‐DMTPLN treatment reduces metastatic burden by 6‐fold and 19‐fold and increases host median survival by 1.3‐fold and 1.6‐fold compared to DMTPLN or free DOX/MMC treatments, respectively.

However, despite its documented association with aggressive side effects and developed resistance, immune checkpoint blockade continues to dominate the TNBC immunotherapy scene. These immune checkpoint blockade drawbacks necessitate the exploration of other immunotherapeutic methods that would expand options for TNBC patients. One such method is the exploitation and recruitment of natural killer cells, which by harnessing the innate rather than adaptive immune system could potentially circumvent the downsides of immune checkpoint blockade. In this review, the authors will elucidate the advantageousness of natural killer cell-based immuno-oncology in TNBC as well as demonstrate the need to more extensively research such therapies in the future."

Areas covered: This article reviews current data and ongoing research on atezolizumab for the treatment of breast cancer. Results of atezolizumab monotherapy trials in the context of other early immune checkpoint blockade trials in breast cancer are discussed as well as data from combination clinical trials with chemotherapy in both early-stage and metastatic breast cancer. We focus on the safety and efficacy analyses from the phase III IMpassion trial that led to FDA and EMA approval of atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel in patients whose tumor tested positive for PD-L1 by the Ventana SP142 companion diagnostic immunohistochemical assay. Expert opinion: The FDA and EMA approvals of atezolizumab mark an important advance for treatment of metastatic TNBC. However, ongoing investigations need to define better biomarkers of response, determine resistance mechanisms, and identify strategies to increase response rates."

Previous study indicated that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) ZEB1‐AS1 was associated with the progression of several cancers. However, its underlying molecular mechanism in TNBC remains to be elucidated. In this study, ZEB1‐AS1 expression was boosted in TNBC tissues and cell lines according to reverse transcription‐quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‐qPCR). Inhibition of ZEB1‐AS1 suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and promoted cell apoptosis in TNBC. Moreover, ZEB1‐AS1 positively regulated ZEB1 expression. RT‐qPCR disclosed ZEB1 expression was elevated in TNBC tissues and ZEB1 silence blocked TNBC progression. RNA pull‐down and RNA immunoprecipitation assays revealed ZEB1‐AS1 and ZEB1 both could bind with ELAVL1. ZEB1‐AS1 maintained ZEB1 messenger RNA (mRNA) stability by binding with ELAVL1. In addition chromatin, immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays confirmed that ZEB1 could bind with ZEB1‐AS1 promoter and promoted ZEB1‐AS1 expression. Rescue assays manifested ZEB1 overexpression could abolish the inhibitory effect caused by ZEB1‐AS1 inhibition on TNBC progression. To sum up, ZEB1 induced‐upregulation of ZEB1‐AS1 maintained the stability of ZEB1 mRNA by binding with ELAVL1, which formed a feedback loop to facilitate TNBC progression. These findings might provide a new target for TNBC treatment."

Due to the absence of the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 expression, TNBC lacks meaningful biomarkers and an effective therapeutic strategy. Chemotherapy remains the main adjuvant treatment for patients with TNBC. Anthracycline/taxane-based regimens are the standard of care in adjuvant settings. The addition of capecitabine or platinum may offer extra benefits to patients with TNBC, but at the cost of increased toxicity or adverse events. Dose-dense chemotherapy may enhance treatment efficacy in patients who are able to tolerate the treatment regimen, especially in high-risk patients. As a heterogenous disease, TNBC can be classified into several molecular subtypes according to genomic or transcriptional features, which may indicate potential targets for more precise and individualized treatment strategies. With our increased understanding of signal pathways associated with TNBC, as well as the discovery of novel biomarkers indicative of TNBC prognosis, several new therapeutic options are under investigation, and some have already reported good results. In this review, we summarized the current conventional therapeutic strategies and emerging clinical trials regarding adjuvant treatment for TNBC. Furthermore, we evaluated the prognostic value of several potential targets and the progress of targeted therapy in TNBC, both in neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings."

Metabolizing cancer chemoresistance Triple-negative breast cancer is an aggressive malignancy that is not susceptible to hormone inhibition and must therefore be treated with conventional chemotherapy. This includes neoadjuvant chemotherapy, where the treatment is initiated before surgical resection, but unfortunately, patients develop resistance to this intervention, which makes it difficult to fully eradicate their tumors. By tracking individual tumor cell clones and analyzing the genomics of patient-derived xenografts, Echeverria et al. found that this resistance to neoadjuvant therapy can be mediated by a reversible mechanism targetable by a pharmacological inhibitor of mitochondrial metabolism. Eradicating triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) resistant to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is a critical unmet clinical need. In this study, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of treatment-naïve TNBC and serial biopsies from TNBC patients undergoing NACT were used to elucidate mechanisms of chemoresistance in the neoadjuvant setting. Barcode-mediated clonal tracking and genomic sequencing of PDX tumors revealed that residual tumors remaining after treatment with standard frontline chemotherapies, doxorubicin (Adriamycin) combined with cyclophosphamide (AC), maintained the subclonal architecture of untreated tumors, yet their transcriptomes, proteomes, and histologic features were distinct from those of untreated tumors. Once treatment was halted, residual tumors gave rise to AC-sensitive tumors with similar transcriptomes, proteomes, and histological features to those of untreated tumors. Together, these results demonstrated that tumors can adopt a reversible drug-tolerant state that does not involve clonal selection as an AC resistance mechanism. Serial biopsies obtained from patients with TNBC undergoing NACT revealed similar histologic changes and maintenance of stable subclonal architecture, demonstrating that AC-treated PDXs capture molecular features characteristic of human TNBC chemoresistance. Last, pharmacologic inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation using an inhibitor currently in phase 1 clinical development delayed residual tumor regrowth. Thus, AC resistance in treatment-naïve TNBC can be mediated by nonselective mechanisms that confer a reversible chemotherapy-tolerant state with targetable vulnerabilities."

Flubendazole (FLU) is a widely used anthelmintic agent that also exhibits anticancer activity in several cancer types. The aim of this study was to characterize the mechanism of action of FLU on breast cancer stem cell (BCSC)‐like properties and metastasis in TNBC. FLU treatment caused a significant induction of apoptosis, accompanied by G2/M phase accumulation, caspase‐3/‐7 activation and the dysregulation of STAT3 activation in TNBC cells. The latter phenomenon was associated with impairment of cancer stem‐like traits, concomitant with a reduction in the CD24low/CD44high, CD24high/CD49fhigh subpopulation, ALDH1 activity and mammosphere formation. The BCSC‐enriched populations exhibited enhanced metastasis with higher STAT3 activation, while FLU administration inhibited tumor growth, angiogenesis and lung and liver metastasis, coinciding with decreased MMP‐2 and MMP‐9 levels in circulating blood. FLU kills not only rapid proliferating tumor cells but also effectively eradicates BCSC‐like cells in vitro and in vivo. Our findings warrant further investigation of FLU as a treatment for metastatic TNBC."

Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) have been linked to cancer initiation, progression and chemotherapy resistance. Notch signaling is a key pathway regulating TNBC CSC survival. Treatment of TNBC with PI3K or mTORC1/2 inhibitors results in drug-resistant, Notch-dependent CSC. However, downstream mechanisms and potentially druggable Notch effectors in TNBC CSCs are largely unknown. We studied the role of the AKT pathway and mitochondrial metabolism downstream of Notch signaling in TNBC CSC from cell lines representative of different TNBC molecular subtypes as well as a novel patient-derived model. We demonstrate that exposure of TNBC cells to recombinant Notch ligand Jagged1 leads to rapid AKT phosphorylation in a Notch1-dependent but RBP-Jκ independent fashion. This requires mTOR and IKKα. Jagged1 also stimulates mitochondrial respiration and fermentation in an AKT- and IKK-dependent fashion. Notch1 co-localizes with mitochondria in TNBC cells. Pharmacological inhibition of Notch cleavage by gamma secretase inhibitor PF-03084014 in combination with AKT inhibitor MK-2206 or IKK-targeted NF-κB inhibitor Bay11-7082 blocks secondary mammosphere formation from sorted CD90hi or CD44+CD24low (CSCs) cells. A TNBC patient-derived model gave comparable results. Besides mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, Jagged1 also triggers nuclear, NF-κB-dependent transcription of anti-apoptotic gene cIAP-2. This requires recruitment of Notch1, IKKα and NF-κB to the cIAP-2 promoter. Our observations support a model where Jagged1 triggers IKKα-dependent, mitochondrial and nuclear Notch1 signals that stimulate AKT phosphorylation, oxidative metabolism and transcription of survival genes in PTEN wild-type TNBC cells. These data suggest that combination treatments targeting the intersection of the Notch, AKT and NF-κB pathways have potential therapeutic applications against CSCs in TNBC cases with Notch1 and wild-type PTEN expression."
Atezolizumab for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer,"[{'authorId': '7461065', 'name': 'Anne-Sophie Heimes'}, {'authorId': '144713189', 'name': 'Marcus Schmidt'}]",73,2018,2babab3a5e57a027e70c668ba74984382d11875e,"ABSTRACT Introduction: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is associated with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. However, TNBC is known to be more immunogenic compared to other breast cancer subtypes, with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes playing an important prognostic and predictive role. Furthermore, TNBC has a higher level of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Therapeutic blockade of PD-L1 using atezolizumab is thus expected to activate and enhance tumor-speciﬁc T-cell responses, resulting in improved anti-tumor activity. Areas covered: This review summarizes the development and the impact of the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab in advanced TNBC; it examines the mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics and the available preclinical and clinical data. Expert opinion: Atezolizumab, a novel immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-L1, is an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for metastatic TNBC. In general, TNBC has a high unmet medical need, hence the clinical development of atezolizumab should continue, particularly for TNBC. Indeed, atezolizumab has the potential to substantially augment the therapeutic armamentarium for TNBC. This should lead to improved immunotherapeutic strategies and the enhancement of the outcome for this group of breast cancer patients."

Here, we explore the roles of miR‐483‐3p/HDAC8 HDAC8 premiR‐vector on tumorigenicity in TNBC patients. Clinical TNBC specimens and three BC cell lines were prepared. miR‐483‐3p and expression levels were measured using quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction. Cell cycle progression was assessed by a flow‐cytometry method. We also investigated cell proliferation by 3‐2, 5‐diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay and colony formation assay. We used a to overexpress miR‐483‐3p, and a HDAC8‐KO‐vector for knocking out the endogenous production of HDAC8. Our data showed significant downregulation of miR‐483‐3p expression in TNBC clinical and cell line samples. The HDAC8 was also upregulated in both tissue specimens and BC cell lines. We found that increased levels of endogenous miR‐483‐3p affects tumorigenecity of MDA‐MB‐231. Downregulation of HDAC8 using the KO‐vector showed the same pattern. Our results revealed that the miR‐483‐3p suppresses cellular proliferation and progression in TNBC cell lines via targeting HDAC8. Overall, our outcomes demonstrated the role of miR‐483‐3p as a tumor suppressor in TNBC and showed the possible mechanism via HDAC8. In addition, targeted treatment of TNBC with miR‐483‐3p might be considered in the future."

More than one-third of patients with TNBC will present distant metastases during the course of their disease. Although chemotherapy has been the main treatment option for metastatic TNBC for a long time, this scenario has changed recently with the advent of the polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) for patients harbouring a mutation in the BRCA genes (BRCAmut) and also with the results of immunotherapy in patients with PD-L1-positive tumours. The present manuscript proposes a treatment algorithm for patients with metastatic TNBC based on the currently available, most relevant literature on the topic. For patients with a BRCAmut and able to tolerate chemotherapy, we recommend initiating treatment with platins (carboplatin/cisplatin) and to start PARPis at disease progression. For patients with PD-L1-positive tumours (PD-L1 expression on tumour-infiltrating immune cells ≥1%), we recommend first-line treatment with nab-paclitaxel and atezolizumab, when available. In patients without a BRCA mutation and with PD-L1-negative tumours, we recommend single-agent chemotherapy with taxanes (paclitaxel or docetaxel) as a first-line treatment. In patients with a high disease burden or who are very symptomatic, combinations such as anthracyclines plus cyclophosphamide or platins with taxanes are valid options. Chemotherapy should be maintained until the occurrence of disease progression or limiting toxicities. After progression to first-line chemotherapy, anthracyclines are an option for patients who received taxanes and vice versa. For patients who progressed to taxanes and anthracyclines, or who present contraindications to these agents, fluorouracil/capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, cisplatin/carboplatin, vinorelbine and ixabepilone are alternatives. The treatment of TNBC is constantly evolving, and the inclusion of patients in ongoing trials evaluating new targeted agents, immunotherapy and predictive biomarkers should be encouraged, in an attempt to improve metastatic TNBC treatment outcomes."

Whether loss of the three factors contributes to deregulate genes that participate in the progress of TNBC remains unknown. Methods: We performed microRNA arrays and comprehensive analysis to screen for miRNAs that are transcriptionally regulated by ER-α, HER2 and PR. Functional assays and molecular mechanism studies were used to investigate the role of miR-4306 in TNBC. An orthotopic mouse model of TNBC was used to evaluate the therapeutic potential of a cholesterol-conjugated miR-4306 mimic. Results: We found that miR-4306 is transcriptionally regulated by ER-α, HER2 and PR, and the downregulation of miR-4306 in TNBC is caused by the loss of ER-α, HER2 and PR. Clinically, low miR-4306 expression is strongly associated with lymph node metastasis and poor survival for TNBC. Upregulation of miR-4306 greatly suppresses TNBC cell proliferation, migration and invasion and abrogates angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in vitro. According to in vivo models, miR-4306 overexpression considerably inhibits TNBC growth, lung metastasis, angiogenesis and lymph node metastasis. Mechanistic analyses indicate that miR-4306 directly targets SIX1/Cdc42/VEGFA to inactivate the signaling pathways mediated by SIX1/Cdc42/VEGFA. Finally, the orthotopic mouse model of TNBC reveals that miR-4306 mimic can be used for TNBC treatment in combination with cisplatin. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that miR-4306 acts as a tumor suppressor in TNBC and is a potential therapeutic target for TNBC treatment."
Modelling the spatial heterogeneity and molecular correlates of lymphocytic infiltration in triple-negative breast cancer,"[{'authorId': '46499956', 'name': 'Yinyin Yuan'}]",93,2015,40f46a01a36cf6871cf59c38644e618a3b5bb59a,"Lymphocytic infiltration is associated with a favourable prognosis and predicts response to chemotherapy in many cancer types, including the aggressive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, it is not well understood owing to the high levels of spatial heterogeneity within tumours, which is difficult to analyse by traditional pathological assessment. This paper describes an unbiased methodology to statistically model the spatial distribution of lymphocytes among tumour cells based on automated analysis of haematoxylin-and-eosin-stained whole-tumour section images, which is applied to two independent TNBC cohorts of 181 patients with matched microarray gene expression data. The novelty of the proposed methodology is the fusion of image analysis and statistical modelling for an integrative understanding of intratumour heterogeneity of lymphocytic infiltration. Using this methodology, a quantitative measure of intratumour lymphocyte ratio is developed and found to be significantly associated with disease-specific survival in both TNBC cohorts independent to standard clinical parameters. The proposed image-based measure compares favourably to a number of gene expression signatures of immune infiltration. In addition, heterogeneous immune infiltration at the morphological level is reflected at the molecular scale and correlated with increased expression of CTLA4, the target of ipilimumab. Taken together, these results support the fusion of high-throughput image analysis and statistical modelling to offer reproducible and robust biomarkers for the objective identification of patients with poor prognosis and treatment options."

The inability of anticancer agents to cross the blood-brain-barrier represents a critical challenge for successful treatment. In the current study, we investigated the antimetastatic potential of penfluridol, an antipsychotic drug frequently prescribed for schizophrenia with anticancer activity. We show that penfluridol induced apoptosis and reduced the survival of several metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines. In addition, penfluridol treatment significantly reduced the expression of integrin α6, integrin β4, Fak, paxillin, Rac1/2/3, and ROCK1 in vitro. We further evaluated the efficacy of penfluridol in three different in vivo tumor models. We demonstrate that penfluridol administration to an orthotopic model of breast cancer suppressed tumor growth by 49%. On the other hand, penfluridol treatment inhibited the growth of metastatic brain tumors introduced by intracardiac or intracranial injection of breast cancer cells by 90% and 72%, respectively. Penfluridol-treated tumors from all three models exhibited reduced integrin β4 and increased apoptosis. Moreover, chronic administration of penfluridol failed to elicit significant toxic or behavioral side effects in mice. Taken together, our results indicate that penfluridol effectively reduces the growth of primary TNBC tumors and especially metastatic growth in the brain by inhibiting integrin signaling, and prompt further preclinical investigation into repurposing penfluridol for the treatment of metastatic TNBC."

Experimental Design: We evaluate the antitumor efficacy of the anti-AXL monoclonal antibody 20G7-D9 in several TNBC cell xenografts or patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and decipher the underlying mechanisms. In a dataset of 254 basal-like breast cancer samples, genes correlated with AXL expression are enriched in EMT, migration, and invasion signaling pathways. Results: Treatment with 20G7-D9 inhibited tumor growth and bone metastasis formation in AXL-positive TNBC cell xenografts or PDX, but not in AXL-negative PDX, highlighting AXL role in cancer growth and invasion. In vitro stimulation of AXL-positive cancer cells by its ligand GAS6 induced the expression of several EMT-associated genes (SNAIL, SLUG, and VIM) through an intracellular signaling implicating the transcription factor FRA-1, important in cell invasion and plasticity, and increased their migration/invasion capacity. 20G7-D9 induced AXL degradation and inhibited all AXL/GAS6–dependent cell signaling implicated in EMT and in cell migration/invasion. Conclusions: The anti-AXL antibody 20G7-D9 represents a promising therapeutic strategy in TNBC with mesenchymal features by inhibiting AXL-dependent EMT, tumor growth, and metastasis formation.

Although PARP inhibitors represent a promising treatment in TNBC with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations, there is great interest in identifying drug combinations that can extend the use of PARP inhibitors to a majority of TNBC patients with wild-type BRCA1/BRCA2. Here we explored whether mTOR inhibitors, through modulating homologous recombination (HR) repair, would provide therapeutic benefit in combination with PARP inhibitors in preclinical models of BRCA-proficient TNBC. Experimental Design: We have studied the effects of mTOR inhibitors on HR repair following DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). We further demonstrated the in vitro and in vivo activities of combined treatment of mTOR inhibitors with PARP inhibitors in BRCA-proficient TNBC. Moreover, microarray analysis and rescue experiments were used to investigate the molecular mechanisms of action. Results: We found that mTOR inhibitors significantly suppressed HR repair in two BRCA-proficient TNBC cell lines. mTOR inhibitors and PARP inhibitors in combination exhibited strong synergism against these TNBC cell lines. In TNBC xenografts, we observed enhanced efficacy of everolimus in combination with talazoparib (BMN673) compared with either drug alone. We further identified through microarray analysis and by rescue assays that mTOR inhibitors suppressed HR repair and synergized with PARP inhibitors through regulating the expression of SUV39H1 in BRCA-proficient TNBCs. Conclusions: Collectively, these findings strongly suggest that combining mTOR inhibitors and PARP inhibitors would be an effective therapeutic approach to treat BRCA-proficient TNBC patients.

To identify novel targets for TNBC, we evaluated phosphatase expression in breast tumors and characterized their contributions to in vitro and in vivo growth of TNBC. Using Affymetrix microarray analysis of 102 breast cancers, we identified 146 phosphatases that were significantly differentially expressed in TNBC compared with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors. Of these, 19 phosphatases were upregulated (0.66-fold; FDR = 0.05) in TNBC compared with ER-positive breast cancers. We knocked down 17 overexpressed phosphatases in four triple-negative and four ER-positive breast cancer lines using specific siRNAs and found that depletion of six of these phosphatases significantly reduced growth and anchorage-independent growth of TNBC cells to a greater extent than ER-positive cell lines. Further analysis of the phosphatase PTP4A3 (also known as PRL-3) demonstrated its requirement for G1-S cell-cycle progression in all breast cancer cells, but PTP4A3 regulated apoptosis selectively in TNBC cells. In addition, PTP4A3 inhibition reduced the growth of TNBC tumors in vivo Moreover, in silico analysis revealed the PTP4A3 gene to be amplified in 29% of basal-like breast cancers, and high expression of PTP4A3 could serve as an independent prognostic indicator for worse overall survival. Collectively, these studies define the importance of phosphatase overexpression in TNBC and lay the foundation for the development of new targeted therapies directed against phosphatases or their respective signaling pathways for TNBC patients.

Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy is an effective immunotherapeutic strategy that has demonstrated unprecedented efficacy in the treatment of hematological malignancies but has shown limited success in the management of some solid tumors. Many malignant tumors are related to increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1), providing a rationale for ICAM1-specific immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. Here, we validated the expression of ICAM1 in TNBC tissues. Subsequently, we generated a phage-displayed single-chain variable fragment (scFv) library using splenocytes from ICAM1-immunized mice and selected a novel ICAM1-specific scFv, mG2-scFv. Using mG2-scFv as the extracellular antigen binding domain, we constructed ICAM1-specific CAR-T cells and demonstrated the robust and specific killing of TNBC cell lines in vitro. Most importantly, in the TNBC mouse model, ICAM1-specific CAR-T cells significantly reduced the growth of the TNBC tumor, resulting in long-term remission and improved survival. Together, these results indicated that ICAM1-specific CAR-T cells have high therapeutic potential against ICAM1-positive TNBC tumors."

Historically, TNBC has been characterized by an aggressive natural history and worse disease-specific outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has allowed for the dissection of TNBC into molecular subtypes (i.e., basal-like, claudin-low). Within TNBC, several subtypes have emerged as ""immune-activated,"" consistently illustrating better disease outcome. In addition, NGS has revealed a host of molecular features characteristic of TNBC, including high rates of TP53 mutations, PI3K and MEK pathway activation, and genetic similarities to serous ovarian cancers, including inactivation of the BRCA pathway. Identified genetic vulnerabilities of TNBC have led to promising therapeutic approaches, including DNA-damaging agents (i.e., platinum salts and PARP inhibitors), as well as immunotherapy. Platinum salts are routinely incorporated into the treatment of metastatic TNBC; however, best outcomes are observed among those with deficiencies in the BRCA pathway. Although the incorporation of platinum in the neoadjuvant care of patients with TNBC yields higher pathologic complete response (pCR) rates, the impact on longer-term outcome is less clear. The presence of immune infiltrate in TNBC has shown both a predictive and prognostic role. Checkpoint inhibitors, including PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors, are under investigation in the setting of metastatic TNBC and have shown responses in initial clinical trials. Finally, matching emerging therapeutic strategies to optimal subtype of TNBC is of utmost importance as we design future research strategies to improve patient outcome."

Recent studies have demonstrated that this drug resistance is associated with a group of cells known as cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are believed to determine the sensitivity of tumor cells to cancer treatment. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that play significant roles in normal and cancer cells. MiR-223 reportedly acts as a tumor suppressor in a range of cancers. However, the role of miR-223 in TNBC, especially in triple-negative breast cancer stem cells (TNBCSCs), remains unknown. Here, we found that miR-223 expression was down-regulated in CD44+CD24-/low TNBCSCs compared with non-CSCs. Furthermore, we found that miR-223 overexpression resensitized TNBCSCs to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis. The HAX-1 gene, which is located in the mitochondria and functions as an anti-apoptotic protein, was found to be directly regulated by miR-223 in MDA-MB-231 cells. We demonstrated that miR-223 overexpression promoted TRAIL-induced apoptosis through the mitochondria/ROS pathway. In conclusion, our results suggest that miR-223 increases the sensitivity of TNBCSCs to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by targeting HAX-1. Our findings have improved our understanding of the role of miR-223 in TNBC and may contribute to TNBC treatment."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as significant drivers of tumorigenesis and tumor progression in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and present unique opportunities to target various components of the TNBC microenvironment for improved efficacy against this difficult to treat cancer. Effects of miRNAs on multiple targets may improve response rates in the context of this genetically and biologically heterogeneous disease.

LDGI can be efficiently taken up into the stem cells with good biocompatibility to maintain the cellular functions. In addition, CXCR4 on the MSCs is upregulated by iron oxide nanoparticles in the LDGI. Importantly, the drug release and photothermal therapy can be simultaneously achieved upon light irradiation. The released drug can enter the cell nucleus and promote cell apoptosis. Interestingly, light irradiation can control the secretion of cellular microvehicles carrying LDGI for targeted treatment. A remarkable in vitro anticancer effect is observed in MDA‐MB‐231 with near‐infrared laser irradiation. In vivo studies show that the MSCs‐LDGI has the enhanced migration and penetration abilities in the tumor area via both intratumoral and intravenous injection approaches compared with LDGI.

Germ-line mutations may occur in up to 20% of unselected patients with TNBC, which may serve as a biomarker identifying which patients may have tumors that are particularly sensitive to platinums and/or inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase. A substantial proportion of patients with TNBCs not associated with germ-line BRCA mutations may have tumors that are ‘BRCA-like’, rendering those individuals potential candidates for similar strategies. Areas covered: The purpose of this review is to highlight the current standard and experimental treatment strategies. Expert opinion: Recent research that has illuminated the molecular heterogeneity of the disease rationalizes its diverse biological behavior and differential response to chemotherapy. Modern technology platforms provide molecular signatures that can be mined for therapeatic interventions. Target pathways that are commonly dysregulated in cancer cells control cellular processes such as apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis, DNA repair, cell cycle progression, immune modulation and invasion, and metastasis. Novel trial design and re-defined endpoints as surrogates to clinical outcome have been introduced to expedite the development of breakthrough therapies to treat high-risk early-stage breast cancer."

As the mechanistic basis for this aggressive phenotype is unclear, treatment options are limited. Here, we showed an increased population of myeloid-derived immunosuppressor cells (MDSCs) in TNBC patients compared with non-TNBC patients. We found that high levels of the transcription factor &Dgr;Np63 correlate with an increased number of MDSCs in basal TNBC patients, and that &Dgr;Np63 promotes tumor growth, progression, and metastasis in human and mouse TNBC cells. Furthermore, we showed that MDSC recruitment to the primary tumor and metastatic sites occurs via direct &Dgr;Np63-dependent activation of the chemokines CXCL2 and CCL22. CXCR2/CCR4 inhibitors reduced MDSC recruitment, angiogenesis, and metastasis, highlighting a novel treatment option for this subset of TNBC patients. Finally, we found that MDSCs secrete prometastatic factors such as MMP9 and chitinase 3–like 1 to promote TNBC cancer stem cell function, thereby identifying a nonimmunologic role for MDSCs in promoting TNBC progression. These findings identify a unique crosstalk between &Dgr;Np63+ TNBC cells and MDSCs that promotes tumor progression and metastasis, which could be exploited in future combined immunotherapy/chemotherapy strategies for TNBC patients."

We established treatment-resistant TNBC MDA-MB-231/IR cells by irradiating the parental MDA-MB-231 cells 25 times with 2 Gy irradiation and investigated the molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance. The resistant MDA-MB-231/IR cells were enhanced in migration, invasion, and stem cell-like characteristics. Pathway analysis by the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery revealed that the NF-κB pathway, TNF signaling pathway, and Toll-like receptor pathway were enriched in MDA-MB-231/IR cells. Among 77 differentially expressed genes revealed by transcriptome analysis, 12 genes involved in drug and radiation resistance, including interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2), were identified. We found that baicalein effectively reversed the expression of IFIT2, which is reported to be associated with metastasis, recurrence, and poor prognosis in TNBC patients. Baicalein sensitized radio- and chemoresistant cells and induced apoptosis, while suppressing stem cell-like characteristics, such as mammosphere formation, side population, expression of Oct3/4 and ABCG2, and CD44highCD24low population in MDA-MB-231/IR cells. These findings improve our understanding of the genes implicated in radio- and chemoresistance in breast cancer, and indicate that baicalein can serve as a sensitizer that overcomes treatment resistance."

Inhibitors against poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), olaparib and talazoparib, were recently approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (including TNBC) in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations. Despite impressive response rates of ~60%, the prolongation in median progression-free survival with a PARPi is modest, suggesting the emergence of resistance. Several studies have reported that receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as c-MET (also known as hepatocyte growth factor receptor), are involved in resistance to various anti-neoplastic agents, including PARPi. However, the mechanism by which c-MET contributes to acquired resistance to PARPi in TNBC is not fully understood. In this study, we show that hyperactivated c-Met is detected in TNBC cells with acquired resistance to PARPi, and the combination of talazoparib and crizotinib (a multi-kinase inhibitor that inhibits c-MET) synergistically inhibits proliferation in these cells. Unexpectedly, depleting c-MET had limited effect on talazoparib sensitivity in PARPi-resistant cells. Interestingly, we found evidence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) hyperactivation and interaction of EGFR/c-Met in these cells. Notably, combining EGFR and PARP inhibitors resulted in greater inhibition of proliferation in c-MET-depleted TNBC cells, and combined c-MET and EGFR inhibition increased sensitivity to talazoparib in TNBC cells with acquired resistance to PARPi. Our findings suggest that combined inhibition of c-MET and EGFR could potentially re-sensitize TNBC to the cytotoxic effects of PARPi."

Neoadjuvant chemotherapies and radiotherapy remains a mainstay of treatment with only 25–30% of TNBC patients responding. Thus, there is an unmet clinical need to develop novel therapeutic strategies for TNBCs. TNBC cells have increased intracellular oxidative stress and suppressed glutathione, a major antioxidant system, but still, are protected against higher oxidative stress. We screened a panel of antioxidant genes using the TCGA and METABRIC databases and found that expression of the thioredoxin pathway genes is significantly upregulated in TNBC patients compared to non‐TNBC patients and is correlated with adverse survival outcomes. Treatment with auranofin (AF), an FDA‐approved thioredoxin reductase inhibitor caused specific cell death and impaired the growth of TNBC cells grown as spheroids. Furthermore, AF treatment exerted a significant in vivo antitumor activity in multiple TNBC models including the syngeneic 4T1.2 model, MDA‐MB‐231 xenograft and patient‐derived tumor xenograft by inhibiting thioredoxin redox activity. We, for the first time, showed that AF increased CD8+Ve T‐cell tumor infiltration in vivo and upregulated immune checkpoint PD‐L1 expression in an ERK1/2‐MYC‐dependent manner. Moreover, combination of AF with anti‐PD‐L1 antibody synergistically impaired the growth of 4T1.2 primary tumors. Our data provide a novel therapeutic strategy using AF in combination with anti‐PD‐L1 antibody that warrants further clinical investigation for TNBC patients."

Along with endothelium-dependent vessels, there is also vasculogenic mimicry (VM) in the microcirculation of malignant tumors. The role of VM is not completely understood regarding anti-angiogenic treatment. In this study, human TNBC MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T and non-TNBC MCF-7 and BT474 tumor-bearing mice were treated with sunitinib, an anti-angiogenic drug, using a clinically relevant schedule. The drug was administered for one week and then discontinued. Tumor growth and invasion were observed, and the microcirculation patterns were detected with PAS/endomucin staining. Moreover, hypoxia and VM-associated proteins were evaluated with Hypoxyprobe kits and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Sunitinib significantly inhibited tumor growth in the TNBC and non-TNBC tumors. However, MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T tumors regrew and were more aggressive when the treatment was stopped. The discontinuation had no significant effect on the behavior of the non-TNBC MCF-7 and BT474 tumors. The growth of endothelium-dependent vessels in the TNBC MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T tumors were blocked by sunitinib, during which the number of VM channels significantly increased and resulted in a rebound of endothelium-dependent vessels after sunitinib discontinuation. Moreover, the VM-associated proteins VE-cadherin and Twist1 upregulated in the sunitinib-treated MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T tumors. Furthermore, the clinical significance of this upregulation was validated in 174 human breast cancers. The results from human breast cancer specimens indicated that there were more VM-positive TNBC cases than those in non-TNBC cases. HIF-1α, MMP2, VE-cadherin, and Twist1 were also expressed in a higher level in human TNBC compared with non-TNBC. In aconclusion, sunitinib promoted TNBC invasion by VM. The VM status could be helpful to predict the efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapy in patients with TNBC."

For clinical development of AgNP‐based therapeutics, it will be necessary to clearly define the specific physicochemical features of the nanoparticles that will be used, and to tie these properties to biological outcomes. To fill this knowledge gap, we performed thorough structure/function, mechanistic, safety, and efficacy studies to assess the potential for AgNPs to treat TNBC. We establish that AgNPs, regardless of size, shape, or stabilizing agent, are highly cytotoxic to TNBC cells at doses that are not cytotoxic to non‐malignant breast epithelial cells. In contrast, TNBC cells and non‐malignant breast epithelial cells are similarly sensitive to exposure to silver cation (Ag+), indicating that the nanoparticle formulation is essential for the TNBC‐specific cytotoxicity. Mechanistically, AgNPs are internalized by both TNBC and non‐malignant breast cells, but are rapidly degraded only in TNBC cells. Exposure to AgNPs depletes cellular antioxidants and causes endoplasmic reticulum stress in TNBC cells without causing similar damage in non‐malignant breast epithelial cells. AgNPs also cause extensive DNA damage in 3D TNBC tumor nodules in vitro, but do not disrupt the normal architecture of breast acini in 3D cell culture, nor cause DNA damage or induce apoptosis in these structures. Lastly, we show that systemically administered AgNPs are effective at non‐toxic doses for reducing the growth of TNBC tumor xenografts in mice. This work provides a rationale for development of AgNPs as a safe and specific TNBC treatment."

Inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 have been approved for treatment of hormone receptor–positive breast cancers. In contrast, triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are resistant to CDK4/6 inhibition. Here, we demonstrate that a subset of TNBC critically requires CDK4/6 for proliferation, and yet, these TNBC are resistant to CDK4/6 inhibition due to sequestration of CDK4/6 inhibitors into tumor cell lysosomes. This sequestration is caused by enhanced lysosomal biogenesis and increased lysosomal numbers in TNBC cells. We developed new CDK4/6 inhibitor compounds that evade the lysosomal sequestration and are efficacious against resistant TNBC. We also show that coadministration of lysosomotropic or lysosome-destabilizing compounds (an antibiotic azithromycin, an antidepressant siramesine, an antimalaria compound chloroquine) renders resistant tumor cells sensitive to currently used CDK4/6 inhibitors. Lastly, coinhibition of CDK2 arrested proliferation of CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant cells. These observations may extend the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors to TNBCs that are refractory to current anti-CDK4/6 therapies."

Approximately 10-15% of all breast tumors are triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC have a higher risk of relapse and distant metastases compared to other subtypes. The optimal systemic management of TNBC according to national and international guidelines is discussed herein.


Summary
Anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy for patients with TNBC either in the neoadjuvant (NACT) or the adjuvant setting is considered standard of care. Exceptions are small tumors and a low-risk histology, in which chemotherapy can be spared. Dose-dense therapy is more effective in preventing recurrence and increasing survival. The use of nab-paclitaxel instead of a solvent-based taxane can lead to higher pathological complete response (pCR) rates and better outcomes. Platinum agents are effective in increasing pCR when added to anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy at the cost of increased toxicity. Long-term outcome data are lacking. In patients without a pCR, capecitabine leads to improved outcomes.


Key Messages
The standard treatment approach of TNBC is anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy, preferably within the NACT setting. Dose-dense schedules as well as platinum should be considered in the NACT setting. For patients without a pCR, capecitabine is an option to improve the outcome. The role of nab-paclitaxel is under debate. In case of immunogenic tumors, checkpoint inhibitors are promising new agents that merit further investigation."

Thus, it is urgent to explore a new treatment for TNBC. Results: MiR-106a-5p was up-regulated in TNBC tissues and cells, and was positively correlated with the tumor grade, which indicated poor prognosis in TNBC patients. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can transport miR-106a-5p into TNBC cells via exosomes. Functional analysis showed exo-miR-106a-5p secreted by MSCs promoted tumor progression in TNBC cells. Furthermore, lncRNA HAND2-AS1 inhibited miR-106a-5p levels, and HAND2-AS1 was decreased in TNBC tissues and cells. Besides, overexpression of HAND2-AS1 reduced the secretion of exo-miR-106a-5p secretion from MSCs, thus suppressed TNBC development. Conclusion: Our study revealed that HAND2-AS1 inhibited the growth of TNBC, which were mediated by the inhibitory effects of MSC-derived exosomal miR-106a-5p."

Due to its lack of therapeutic targets, it has historically been treated with single agent chemotherapy, with combination cytotoxic therapy typically reserved for patients with high disease burdens, symptomatic disease, and/or impending visceral crisis. Recent molecular analyses have revealed that this clinical group of TNBCs is in fact quite biologically heterogeneous, with multiple TNBC subtypes defined by distinct biology and clinical behavior. Building on this biology, 2 targeted strategies are now approved for selected patients with advanced TNBC: the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors for advanced TNBC with a germline mutation in BRCA1/2, and the combination of the programmed death ligand 1-specific antibody atezolizumab with nab-paclitaxel for advanced TNBC that expresses programmed death ligand 1 on immune cells within the tumor. These targeted agents tend to be associated with a more favorable side effect profile and longer disease control than standard chemotherapy. A number of other targeted therapies have shown promise in early clinical trials, and several are now in definitive phase 3 testing for advanced TNBC. These include the antiapoptotic kinase inhibitors ipatisertib and capivasertib, and the antibody-drug conjugate sacituzumab govitecan-hziy. Approved biomarker-driven treatment options for this disease are thus likely to expand in the near-term. Here we review current treatment options and emerging targeted therapies for advanced TNBC. For patients who do not meet criteria for approved targeted therapies, participation in clinical trials evaluating precision medicines with candidate predictive biomarkers in advanced TNBC should be encouraged."

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is life-threatening because of limited therapies and lack of effective therapeutic targets. Here, we found that moesin (MSN) was significantly overexpressed in TNBC compared with other subtypes of breast cancer and was positively correlated with poor overall survival. However, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of MSN in TNBC. We found that MSN significantly stimulated breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and tumor growth in vivo, requiring the phosphorylation of MSN and a nucleoprotein NONO-assisted nuclear localization of phosphorylated MSN with protein kinase C (PKC) and then the phosphorylation activation of CREB signaling by PKC. Our study also demonstrated that targeting MSN, NONO, or CREB significantly inhibited breast tumor growth in vivo. These results introduce a new understanding of MSN function in breast cancer and provide favorable evidence that MSN or its downstream molecules might serve as new targets for TNBC treatment."

We previously reported SBI-0206965, a small molecule inhibitor of unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1), which is a key regulator of autophagy initiation. Herein, we describe the design, synthesis, and characterization of new dual inhibitors of ULK1 and ULK2 (ULK1/2). One inhibitor, SBP-7455 (compound 26), displayed improved binding affinity for ULK1/2 compared with SBI-0206965, potently inhibited ULK1/2 enzymatic activity in vitro and in cells, reduced the viability of TNBC cells and had oral bioavailability in mice. SBP-7455 inhibited starvation-induced autophagic flux in TNBC cells that were dependent on autophagy for survival and displayed synergistic cytotoxicity with the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib against TNBC cells. These data suggest that combining ULK1/2 and PARP inhibition may have clinical utility for the treatment of TNBC."

Molecular studies demonstrated that TNBCs are a heterogeneous group of tumors with different clinical and pathologic features, prognosis, genetic-molecular alterations and treatment responsivity. The PI3K/AKT is a major pathway involved in the regulation of cell survival and proliferation, and is the most frequently altered pathway in breast cancer, apparently with different biologic impact on specific cancer subtypes. The most common genetic abnormality is represented by PIK3CA gene activating mutations, with an overall frequency of 20–40%. The aims of our study were to investigate PIK3CA gene mutations on a large series of TNBC, to perform a wider analysis on genetic alterations involving PI3K/AKT and BRAF/RAS/MAPK pathways and to correlate the results with clinical-pathologic data. Materials and Methods PIK3CA mutation analysis was performed by using cobas® PIK3CA Mutation Test. EGFR, AKT1, BRAF, and KRAS genes were analyzed by sequencing. Immunohistochemistry was carried out to identify PTEN loss and to investigate for PI3K/AKT pathways components. Results PIK3CA mutations were detected in 23.7% of TNBC, whereas no mutations were identified in EGFR, AKT1, BRAF, and KRAS genes. Moreover, we observed PTEN loss in 11.3% of tumors. Deregulation of PI3K/AKT pathways was revealed by consistent activation of pAKT and p-p44/42 MAPK in all PIK3CA mutated TNBC. Conclusions Our data shows that PIK3CA mutations and PI3K/AKT pathway activation are common events in TNBC. A deeper investigation on specific TNBC genomic abnormalities might be helpful in order to select patients who would benefit from current targeted therapy strategies."
Triple-negative breast cancer: immune modulation as the new treatment paradigm.,"[{'authorId': '152462975', 'name': 'M. Disis'}, {'authorId': '37796859', 'name': 'S. Stanton'}]",90,2015,2ab039c73aca46f7954547ff2feaf4f1261c75ec,"Recent studies of tumor lymphocytic immune infiltrates in breast cancer have suggested an improved prognosis associated with increasing levels of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the breast cancer subtype that has the greatest incidence of patients with a robust tumor immune infiltrate, although it is still a minority of patients. Elevated levels of either intratumoral or stromal T cells are associated with an improved overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in TNBC as compared with other breast cancer subtypes. TNBC may be immunogenic for several reasons. Subtypes of TNBC have a significant number of genetic mutations, and the immune system may see the aberrant proteins encoded by these mutations as foreign. Moreover, TNBC is associated with a prognostic gene signature that also includes B cells. Antibodies secreted by B cells may bind to tumor antigens and amplify the adaptive immune response that has already been initiated in the tumor. New immune modulatory agents, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, have shown activity in immunogenic tumors such as melanoma and bladder cancer and have recently been tested in TNBC. The clinical response rates observed, patterns of response, and adverse event profiles are similar to what has been described in melanoma where this class of agents has already been approved for clinical use in some cases. Lessons learned in assessing the immunogenicity of TNBC, potential mechanisms of immune stimulation, and response to immune modulatory drugs lay the foundation for the development of immune-based therapies in all subtypes of the disease."

RADV is of extremely high drug loading ratio (27.5 wt%) by self‐assembly of the phospholipid‐mimic Dox prodrug into the liposomal bilayer membrane. RADV displays good colloidal stability to prevent premature drug leakage during the blood circulation and inert photochemotoxicity to avoid nonspecific side effect. RADV passively accumulates at tumor site through the enhanced permeability and retention effect when administrated systemically. Once deposited at the tumor site, RADV generates fluorescent and photoacoustic signals to guide near‐infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, which can induce localized ROS generation, not only to trigger prodrug activation and ultrafast drug release but also conduct photodynamic therapy in a spatiotemporally controlled manner. In combination with NIR laser irradiation, RADV efficiently inhibits the tumor growth and distant metastasis of TNBC.

In this study, we developed a biomimetic nanodrug consisting of a self-assembling variant (HFn) of human apoferritin loaded with curcumin. HFn nanocage improved the solubility, chemical stability, and bioavailability of curcumin, allowing us to reliably carry out several experiments in the attempt to establish the potential of this molecule as a therapeutic agent and elucidate the mechanism of action in TNBC. HFn biopolymer was designed to bind selectively to the TfR1 receptor overexpressed in TNBC cells. HFn-curcumin (CFn) proved to be more effective in viability assays compared to the drug alone using MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, representative of basal and claudin-low TNBC subtypes, respectively. Cellular uptake of CFn was demonstrated by flow cytometry and label-free confocal Raman imaging. CFn could act as a chemosensitizer enhancing the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin by interfering with the activity of multidrug resistance transporters. In addition, CFn exhibited different cell cycle effects on these two TNBC cell lines, blocking MDA-MB-231 in G0/G1 phase, whereas MDA-MB-468 accumulated in G2/M phase. CFn was able to inhibit the Akt phosphorylation, suggesting that the effect on the proliferation and cell cycle involved the alteration of PI3K/Akt pathway."

Here, we report for the first time a distinctive and profound role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR5 in the growth and metastasis of TNBC. An analysis of primary TNBC specimen by whole-exon sequencing revealed strong gene amplifications of UBR5 associated with the disease. UBR5 overexpression in TNBC tissues was confirmed at mRNA and protein levels. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of ubr5 in an experimental murine mammary carcinoma model of TNBC dramatically abrogated tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, which could be reversed completely via reconstitution with wild-type UBR5 but not a catalytically inactive mutant. Loss of UBR5 caused an impairment in angiogenesis within the tumor, associated with increased apoptosis, necrosis, and growth arrest. Absence of UBR5 in the tumor triggered aberrant epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, principally via abrogated expression of E-cadherin, which resulted in severely reduced tumor metastasis to secondary organs. Use of NOD/SCID mice revealed that tumor-derived UBR5 facilitated tumor growth in a manner completely dependent upon immune cells in the microenvironment, whereas it promoted metastasis in a tumor cell-autonomous fashion. Our findings unveil UBR5 as a novel and critical regulator of tumor growth, metastasis, and immune response and highlight the potential for UBR5 as an effective therapeutic target for the treatment of highly aggressive breast and ovarian cancers that fail conventional therapy.

In this study, we investigated the effect of fisetin on triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. TNBC has a poorer prognosis than other types of breast cancer and treatment options for this disease are limited. Fisetin inhibited the growth of MDA‐MB‐468 and MDA‐MB‐231 TNBC cells, as well as their ability to form colonies, without substantially affecting the growth of non‐malignant cells. In addition, fisetin inhibited the growth of estrogen receptor‐bearing MCF‐7 breast cancer cells and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2‐overexpressing SK‐BR‐3 breast cancer cells. Fisetin inhibited TNBC cell division and induced apoptosis, which was associated with mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and the activation of caspase‐9 and caspase‐8, as well as the cleavage of poly(ADP‐ribose) polymerase‐1. Induction of caspase‐dependent apoptosis by fisetin was confirmed by reduced killing of TNBC cells in the presence of the pan‐caspase inhibitors Z‐VAD‐FMK and BOC‐D‐FMK. Decreased phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 in fisetin‐treated TNBC cells at G2/M phase of the cell cycle suggested that fisetin‐induced apoptosis was the result of Aurora B kinase inhibition. Interestingly, the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin, 5‐fluorouracil, and 4‐hydroxycyclophosphamide metabolite of cyclophosphamide on TNBC cells was increased in the presence of fisetin. These findings suggest that further investigation of fisetin is warranted for possible use in the management of TNBC. J. Cell. Biochem. 117: 1913–1925, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Our experimental model was based on the use of eight TNBC cell lines: MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, HCC70, HCC38, HCC1937, HCC1143, BT-20, and BT-549. Berberine was cytotoxic against all treated TNBC cell lines. The most sensitive cell lines were HCC70 (IC50 = 0.19 µM), BT-20 (IC50 = 0.23 µM) and MDA-MB-468 (IC50 = 0.48 µM). Using flow cytometry techniques, berberine, at 0.5 and 1 µM for 120 and 144 h, not only induced cell cycle arrest, at G1 and/or G2/M phases, but it also triggered significant apoptosis. At the molecular level, these results are consistent with the expression of their related proteins using Western blot assays. Interestingly, while berberine was cytotoxic against TNBC cells, it had no effect on the viability of normal human breast cells MCF10A cultured in a 3D matrigel model. These results suggest that berberine may be a good potential candidate for TNBC drug development."

Thus, it is imperative to search for novel drug candidates with potent anti-TNBC effects. Recent studies suggest that isoliquiritigenin (ISL) can significantly suppress the growth, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells. We previously synthesized ISL derivatives and found that 3′,4′,5′,4″-tetramethoxychalcone (TMC) inhibits TNBC cell proliferation to a greater degree than ISL. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the anti-TNBC effects of TMC in vitro and in vivo. We show that TMC significantly inhibits the proliferative, migratory, and invasive abilities of MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells. TMC induces apoptosis through the upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2. PCR arrays demonstrate a significant decrease in miR-374a expression in TNBC cells after 24-h TMC treatment. MiR-374a is overexpressed in TNBC cells and has oncogenic properties. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed that TMC inhibits miR-374a in a dose-dependent manner, and luciferase assays confirmed that BAX is targeted by miR-374a. Further, we show that TMC increases Bax protein and mRNA levels by inhibiting miR-374a. TMC also attenuates TNBC tumor volumes and weights in vivo. These results demonstrate that TMC inhibits TNBC cell proliferation, foci formation, migration, invasion, and tumorigenesis, suggesting its potential to serve as a novel drug for treating TNBC through miR-374a repression."

The identification of genomic aberrations that drive each of the TNBC subtypes may predict the prognosis of patients with TNBC and provide novel therapeutic strategies in clinical practice. This study focuses on the transcriptome-based gene expression of TNBC and aims to generate comprehensive gene co-expression networks correlated with the immune-related subtype of TNBC. Methods: The transcriptome profiles of 107 female patients with TNBC were analyzed. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied to construct related networks and to sort hub-genes associated with the survival of TNBC patients. The data of the transcriptional expression, genomic alteration, survival status, and tumor immune microenvironment, which associated with hub-genes, were extracted, retrieved, and analyzed from Oncomine, UALCAN, TCGA, starBase, Kaplan–Meier Plotter, cBioPortal, and TIMER databases. Results: Immune-related hub-genes, including BIRC3, BTN3A1, CSF2RB, GIMAP7, GZMB, HCLS1, LCP2, and SELL, were found to be associated with clinical features of TNBC evaluated by WGCNA. These hub-genes belonged to the immunomodulatory subtype of TNBC and were upregulated in the TNBC cells. The protein expression of eight immune-related hub-genes was further confirmed to be upregulated in TNBC/CD8+ tissues detected by immunohistochemical staining. Survival analysis revealed that overexpression of eight immune-related hub-genes was in favor of the survival of patients with TNBC. Moreover, a positive correlation between eight immune-related hub-genes and immune cell infiltration was observed in TNBC patients. Furthermore, checkpoint inhibitor genes such as PD-L1, PD-1, and CTLA4 were more enrichment in the immunomodulatory subtype of TNBC and the expression of PD-L1, PD-1, and CTLA4 was positively correlated with eight immune-related hub-genes in the breast cancer dataset of TCGA. Conclusions: Eight immune-related hub-genes were identified to be molecular signatures in the immunomodulatory subtype of TNBC, which may provide therapeutic targets for the treatment of patients with breast cancer."

Treatment of TNBC is more challenging than other subtypes of breast cancer due to the lack of markers for the molecularly targeted therapies (ER, PR, and HER-2/ Neu), the conventional chemotherapeutic agents are still the mainstay of the therapeutic protocols of its patients. Despite, TNBC being more chemo-responsive than other subtypes, unfortunately, the initial good response to the chemotherapy eventually turns into a refractory drug-resistance. Using a monotherapy for the treatment of cancer, especially high-grade tumors like TNBC, is mostly worthless due to the inherent genetic instability of tumor cells to develop intrinsic and acquired resistance. Thus, a cocktail of two or more drugs with different mechanisms of action is more effective and could successfully control the disease. Furthermore, combination therapy reveals more, or at least the same, effectiveness with lower doses of each single agent and decreases the likelihood of chemoresistance. Herein, we shed light on the novel combinatorial approaches targeting PARP, EGFR, PI3K pathway, AR, and wnt signaling, HDAC, MEK pathway for efficient treatment of high-grade tumors like TNBC and decreasing the onset of resistance."

Immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy shows good therapeutic potential. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that metronomic chemotherapy may stimulate anticancer immune responses. We aimed to verify whether metronomic paclitaxel (PTX, TAX) treatment can improve the efficacy of a PD-1 mAb in a TNBC mouse model and to explore the potential mechanism. After constructing the TNBC mouse model and treating with PD-1 mAb, metronomic PTX chemotherapy or combined therapy, the differences in the efficacy of each treatment group were compared and analyzed. Our findings suggested that the combination of metronomic PTX chemotherapy and PD-1 mAb produces a potent antitumor effect. Further experiments demonstrated that metronomic PTX chemotherapy changed the immune cell population in tumor tissues. These data suggest that metronomic PTX improves the efficacy of the PD-1 mAb in TNBC by transforming the tumor immune microenvironment, and these results provide strong evidence for the use of this treatment in TNBC patients in the future."

Here, we demonstrate that ECs—when mixed with TNBC cells—could increase TNBC cell metastatic potency. After treatment with TGF‐p to induce endothelial‐mesenchymal transition (EMT), TNBC cells could produce plasminogen activator inhibitor‐1 (PAI‐1) and stimulate the expression and secretion of the che‐ mokine, CCL5, from ECs, which then acts in a paracrine fashion on TNBC cells to enhance their migration, invasion, and metastasis. CCL5, in turn, accelerates TNBC cell secretion of PAI‐1 and promotes TNBC cell metastasis, thus forming a positive feedback loop. Moreover, this enhanced metastatic ability is reversible and dependent on CCL5 signaling via the chemokine receptor, CCR5. Of importance, key features of this pathway are manifested in patients with TNBC and in The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Taken together, our results suggest that ECs enhance EMT‐ induced TNBC cell metastasis via PAI‐1 and CCL5 signaling and illustrate the potential of developing new PAI‐1‐ and CCL5‐targeting therapy for patients with TNBC.—Zhang, W., Xu, J., Fang, H., Tang, L., Chen, W., Sun, Q., Zhang, Q., Yang, F., Sun, Z., Cao, L., Wang, Y., Guan, X.

Overexpression of cyclin E and phosphorylated-CDK2 are correlated with poor survival in patients with TNBC, and the absence of CDK2 desensitizes cells to inhibition of Wee1 kinase, a key cell-cycle regulator. We hypothesize that cyclin E expression can predict response to therapies, which include the Wee1 kinase inhibitor, AZD1775. Experimental Design: Mono- and combination therapies with AZD1775 were evaluated in TNBC cell lines and multiple patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with different cyclin E expression profiles. The mechanism(s) of cyclin E–mediated replicative stress were investigated following cyclin E induction or CRISPR/Cas9 knockout by a number of assays in multiple cell lines. Results: Cyclin E overexpression (i) is enriched in TNBCs with high recurrence rates, (ii) sensitizes TNBC cell lines and PDX models to AZD1775, (iii) leads to CDK2-dependent activation of DNA replication stress pathways, and (iv) increases Wee1 kinase activity. Moreover, treatment of cells with either CDK2 inhibitors or carboplatin leads to transient transcriptional induction of cyclin E (in cyclin E–low tumors) and result in DNA replicative stress. Such drug-mediated cyclin E induction in TNBC cells and PDX models sensitizes them to AZD1775 in a sequential treatment combination strategy. Conclusions: Cyclin E is a potential biomarker of response (i) for AZD1775 as monotherapy in cyclin E–high TNBC tumors and (ii) for sequential combination therapy with CDK2 inhibitor or carboplatin followed by AZD1775 in cyclin E–low TNBC tumors."

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are associated with Dox resistance in MCF-7 estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) may functionally shift non-CSCs towards CSCs. However, whether Stat3 drives the formation of CSCs during the development of resistance in TNBC, and whether a Stat3 inhibitor reverses CSC-mediated Dox resistance, remains to be elucidated. In the present study, human MDA-MB-468 and murine 4T1 mammary carcinoma cell lines with the typical characteristics of TNBCs, were compared with estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cells as a model system. The MTT assay was used to detect cytotoxicity of Dox. In addition, the expression levels of CSC-specific markers and transcriptional factors were measured by western blotting, immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry. The mammosphere formation assay was used to detect stem cell activity. Under long-term continuous treatment with Dox at a low concentration, TNBC cultures not only exhibited a drug-resistant phenotype, but also showed CSC properties. These Dox-resistant TNBC cells showed activation of Stat3 and high expression levels of pluripotency transcription factors octamer-binding transcription factor-4 (Oct-4) and c-Myc, which was different from the high expression of superoxide dismutase 2 (Sox2) in Dox-resistant MCF-7 cells. WP1066 inhibited the phosphorylation of Stat3, and decreased the expression of Oct-4 and c-Myc, leading to a reduction in the CD44-positive cell population, and restoring the sensitivity of the cells to Dox. Taken together, a novel signal circuit of Stat3/Oct-4/c-Myc was identified for regulating stemness-mediated Dox resistance in TNBC. The Stat3 inhibitor WP1066 was able to overcome the resistance to Dox through decreasing the enrichment of CSCs, highlighting the therapeutic potential of WP1066 as a novel sensitizer of Dox-resistant TNBC."

Fisetin, a natural flavonoid compound, has been demonstrated to possess anti-cancer effects in various cancers. However, the effects and mechanisms of fisetin on metastasis of TNBC remain uncovered. In this study, we found that fisetin dose-dependently inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion in TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells. In addition, fisetin reversed epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) as evaluated by cell morphology and EMT markers in MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells. Furthermore, fisetin suppressed phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-GSK-3β signaling pathway but upregulated the expression of PTEN mRNA and protein in a concentration-dependent manner. Further, silence of PTEN by siRNA abolished these benefits of fisetin on proliferation and metastasis of TNBCs. In vivo, using the metastatic breast cancer xenograft model bearing MDA-MB-231 cells, we found that fisetin dramatically inhibited growth of primary breast tumor and reduced lung metastasis, meanwhile, the expression of EMT molecules and PTEN/Akt/GSK-3β in primary and metastatic tissues changed in the same way as those in vitro experiments. In conclusion, all these results indicated that fisetin could effectively suppress proliferation and metastasis of TNBC and reverse EMT process, which might be mediated by PTEN/Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway."

However, the mechanism of homing and recruitment of BM-MSCs into tumors and their potential role in malignant tissue progression is poorly understood and controversial. Here we show that BM-MSCs increase aggressiveness of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines evaluated as capability to migrate, invade and acquire stemness markers. Importantly, we demonstrate that the treatment of BM-MSCs with a nuclease-resistant RNA aptamer against platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) causes the inhibition of receptor-dependent signaling pathways thus drastically hampering BM-MSC recruitment towards TNBC cell lines and BM-MSCs trans-differentiation into carcinoma-associated fibroblast (CAF)-like cells. Moreover, in vivo molecular imaging analysis demonstrated the aptamer ability to prevent BM-MSCs homing to TNBC xenografts. Collectively, our results indicate the anti-PDGFRβ aptamer as a novel therapeutic tool to interfere with BM-MSCs attraction to TNBC providing the rationale to further explore the aptamer in more complex pre-clinical settings."

TNBC carries a worse prognosis than other breast cancer subtypes, and with the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of TNBC, there is a lack of effective therapeutic targets available. Identification of molecular targets for TNBC subtypes is crucial towards personalized patient stratification. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) has been shown to induce p53 mutation accumulation, basal-like gene signature enrichment and transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) via s-nitrosylation. Herein we report that iNOS is associated with disease recurrence, distant metastasis and decreased breast cancer specific survival in 209 cases of TNBC. Employing TNBC cell lines representing normal basal breast, and basal-like 1 and basal-like 2 tumors, we demonstrate that nitric oxide (NO) induces EGFR-dependent ERK phosphorylation in basal-like TNBC cell lines. Moreover NO mediated cell migration and cell invasion was found to be dependent on EGFR and ERK activation particularly in basal-like 2 TBNC cells. This occurred in conjunction with NF-κB activation and increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8, IL-1β and TNF-α. This provides substantial evidence for EGFR as a therapeutic target to be taken into consideration in the treatment of a specific subset of basal-like TNBC overexpressing iNOS."

It comprises approximately 15-20% of breast cancers (BCs). Unfortunately, TNBC's treatment continues to be a clinical problem because of its relatively poor prognosis, its aggressiveness and the lack of targeted therapies, leaving chemotherapy as the mainstay of treatment. It is essential to find new therapies against TNBC, in order to surpass the resistance and the invasiveness of already existing therapies. Given the fact that epigenetic processes control both the initiation and progression of TNBC, there is an increasing interest in the mechanisms, molecules and signaling pathways that participate at the epigenetic modulation of genes expressed in carcinogenesis. The acetylation of histone proteins provokes the transcription of genes involved in cell growth, and the expression of histone deacetylases (HDACs) is frequently up-regulated in many malignancies. Unfortunately, in the field of BC, HDAC inhibitors have shown limited effect as single agents. Nevertheless, their use in combination with kinase inhibitors, autophagy inhibitors, ionizing radiation, or two HDAC inhibitors together is currently being evaluated. HDAC inhibitors such as suberoylanilidehydroxamic acid (SAHA), sodium butyrate, mocetinostat, panobinostat, entinostat, YCW1 and N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propylpentanamide have shown promising therapeutic outcomes against TNBC, especially when they are used in combination with other anticancer agents. More studies concerning HDAC inhibitors in breast carcinomas along with a more accurate understanding of the TNBC's pathobiology are required for the possible identification of new therapeutic strategies."

We investigated the value of TIL levels by evaluating lymphocyte infiltration before and after NAC. Experimental Design: We assessed stromal TIL levels in 716 pre- and posttreatment matched paired specimens, according to the guidelines of the International TIL Working Group. Results: Pre-NAC TIL levels were higher in tumors for which pCR was achieved than in cases with residual disease (33.9% vs. 20.3%, P = 0.001). This was observed in luminal tumors and TNBCs, but not in HER2-positive breast cancers (PInteraction = 0.001). The association between pre-NAC TIL levels and pCR was nonlinear in TNBCs (P = 0.005). Mean TIL levels decreased after chemotherapy completion (pre-NAC TILs: 24.1% vs. post-NAC TILs: 13.0%, P < 0.001). This decrease was strongly associated with high pCR rates, and the variation of TIL levels was strongly inversely correlated with pre-NAC TIL levels (r = −0.80, P < 0.001). Pre-NAC TILs and disease-free survival (DFS) were associated in a nonlinear manner (P < 0.001). High post-NAC TIL levels were associated with aggressive tumor characteristics and with impaired DFS in HER2-positive breast cancers (HR, 1.04; confidence interval, 1.02–1.06; P = 0.001), but not in luminal tumors or TNBCs (PInteraction = 0.04). Conclusions: The associations of pre- and post-NAC TIL levels with response to treatment and DFS differ between breast cancer subtypes. The characterization of immune subpopulations may improve our understanding of the complex interactions between pre- or post-NAC setting, breast cancer subtype, response to treatment, and prognosis."

Cadherin 11 (CDH11) is overexpressed in invasive breast cancer cells and implicated in distant bone metastases in several cancers. The WNT signalling pathway regulates CSC activity. Growing evidence suggest that cadherins play critical roles in WNT signalling pathway. However, CDH11 role in canonical WNT signalling and CSCs in breast cancer is poorly understood. Methods: We investigated the functional association between CDH11 and WNT signalling pathway in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), by analyzing their expression profile in the TCGA Breast Cancer (BRCA) cohort and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of TNBC samples. Results: We observed a significant correlation between high CDH11 expression and poor prognosis in the basal and TNBC subtypes. Also, CDH11 expression positively correlated with β-catenin, wingless type MMTV integration site (WNT)2, and transcription factor (TCF)12 expression. IHC results showed CDH11 and β-catenin expression significantly correlated in TNBC patients (p < 0.05). We also showed that siRNA-mediated loss-of-CDH11 (siCDH11) function decreases β-catenin, Met, c-Myc, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)7 expression level in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578t. Interestingly, immunofluorescence staining showed that siCDH11 reduced β-catenin nuclear localization and attenuated TNBC cell migration, invasion and tumorsphere-formation. Of translational relevance, siCDH11 exhibited significant anticancer efficacy in murine tumor xenograft models, as demonstrated by reduced tumor-size, inhibited tumor growth and longer survival time. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that by modulating β-catenin, CDH11 regulates the canonical WNT signalling pathway. CDH11 inhibition suppresses the CSC-like phenotypes and tumor growth of TNBC cells and represents a novel therapeutic approach in TNBC treatment."

Therefore, TNBC treatment remains a challenge. Targeting programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), for example, atezolizumab, has revolutionized the treatment for various cancer types. However, the therapeutic efficacy of targeting PD-L1 in TNBC is currently under investigation. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which the human TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231, expressing PD-L1, responds to atezolizumab, using RNA-Seq. Transcriptome analysis revealed 388 upregulated and 362 downregulated genes in response to atezolizumab treatment. The expression of selected genes, from RNA-Seq data, was subsequently validated using RT-qPCR in the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cells following atezolizumab treatment. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that atezolizumab downregulates genes promoting cell migration/invasion and metastasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell growth/proliferation/survival, and hypoxia. On the contrary, genes associated with apoptosis and DNA repair were upregulated in response to atezolizumab treatment. Gene set enrichment analyses revealed that a significant number of these genes are related to the NF-kB, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, MAPK, and CD40 signaling pathways. Using functional assays, we confirmed that atezolizumab increases MDA-MB-231 cell apoptosis/necrosis, and reduces their proliferation and viability. Collectively, our findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms/signaling pathways by which atezolizumab exerts inhibitory effects on TNBC, thereby inhibiting EMT/metastasis, tumor growth/survival, and the induction of hypoxia."

Duration of response is usually short, with rapid relapse very common and median survival of just 13 months. The newly approved agent eribulin has shown a survival benefit in patients who had previously been treated with anthracycline- or taxane-containing regimens, including in patients with TNBC. Platinum-based regimens are an emerging option for patients with BRCA1 mutation, and newer targeted agents such as anti-angiogenic treatment with bevacizumab or anti-epidermal growth factor receptor treatment with cetuximab, have shown some benefit in combination therapy. However, there remains an urgent unmet need for improved targeted agents for this patient population. Improved treatment may be facilitated by biomarker-led understanding of subgroup molecular targets, which may predict benefit from currently approved agents, as well as newer targeted drugs."

Common prognostic biomarkers give very restricted predictive information of tumor recurrences in TNBC. Human serum contains stably expressed microRNAs (miRNAs), which have been discovered to predict prognosis in patients with cancer. The purpose of this study was to identify circulating biomarkers able to predict clinical outcome in TNBC. Experimental Design: We performed genome-wide serum miRNA expression and real-time PCR analyses to investigate the ability of miRNAs in predicting tumor relapse in serum samples from 60 primary TNBC. Patients were divided into training and testing cohorts. Results: By Cox regression analysis, we identified a four-miRNA signature (miR-18b, miR-103, miR-107, and miR-652) that predicted tumor relapse and overall survival. This miRNA signature was further validated in an independent cohort of 70 TNBC. A high-risk signature score was developed and significantly associated with tumor recurrence and reduced survival. Multivariate Cox regression models indicated that the risk score based on the four-miRNA signature was an independent prognostic classifier of patients with TNBC. Conclusions: This signature may serve as a minimally invasive predictor of tumor relapse and overall survival for patients with TNBC. This prediction model may ultimately lead to better treatment options for patients with TNBC. Clin Cancer Res; 21(5); 1207–14. ©2014 AACR."

Transactivating Resistance Resistance to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors in cancer is often mediated by the activation of alternate receptors that provide compensatory signaling. Meyer et al. showed that the RTK AXL predicts resistance to EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) inhibitors in cancer cell lines. Through a ligand-independent mode of transactivation by EGFR, AXL mediated the downstream activation of proteins in a distinct combination, thereby augmenting EGFR signaling and contributing unique output. Diversified, AXL-mediated signaling was required for EGF (epidermal growth factor)–induced migration of TNBC (triple-negative breast cancer) cells. Expression profiles of AXL and EGFR in cancer cell lines predicted resistance to EGFR inhibitors, and treatment with an AXL inhibitor reduced EGFR-elicited proliferation and migration, suggesting that targeting AXL may improve EGFR-targeted drug therapy in TNBC. The relationship between drug resistance, changes in signaling, and emergence of an invasive phenotype is well appreciated, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Using machine learning analysis applied to the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database, we identified expression of AXL, the gene that encodes the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)–associated receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL, as exceptionally predictive of lack of response to ErbB family receptor–targeted inhibitors. Activation of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) transactivated AXL, and this ligand-independent AXL activity diversified EGFR-induced signaling into additional downstream pathways beyond those triggered by EGFR alone. AXL-mediated signaling diversification was required for EGF (epidermal growth factor)–elicited motility responses in AXL-positive TNBC (triple-negative breast cancer) cells. Using cross-linking coimmunoprecipitation assays, we determined that AXL associated with EGFR, other ErbB receptor family members, MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor), and PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor) but not IGF1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) or INSR (insulin receptor). From these AXL interaction data, we predicted AXL-mediated signaling synergy for additional RTKs and validated these predictions in cells. This alternative mechanism of receptor activation limits the use of ligand-blocking therapies and indicates against therapy withdrawal after acquired resistance. Further, subadditive interaction between EGFR- and AXL-targeted inhibitors across all AXL-positive TNBC cell lines may indicate that increased abundance of EGFR is principally a means to transactivation-mediated signaling."

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and highly heterogeneous subtype of breast cancer and associated with poor prognosis. A better understanding of the biology of this complex cancer is needed to develop novel therapeutic strategies for improvement of patient survival. We have previously demonstrated that Thymoquinone (TQ), the major phenolic compound found in Nigella sativa, induces anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects and inhibits in vivo tumor growth in orthotopic TNBC models in mice. Also, we have previously shown that Beclin-1 and LC3 autophagy genes contributes to TNBC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, suggesting that Beclin-1 and LC3 genes provide proto-oncogenic effects in TNBC. However, the role of Beclin1 and LC3 in mediating TQ-induced anti-tumor effects in TNBC is not known.


OBJECTIVE
To investigate the effects of TQ on the major autophagy mediators, Beclin-1 and LC3 expression, as wells autophagic activity in TNBC cells.


METHODS
Cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and autophagy activity were evaluated using MTS cell viability, colony formation assay, wound healing and acridine orange staining assays, respectively. Western blotting and RT-PCR assays were used to investigate LC3 and Beclin-1 protein and gene expressions, respectively, in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells in response to TQ treatments.


RESULTS
TQ treatment significantly inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and autophagic activity of MDA-MB-231 cells and suppressed LC3 and Beclin-1 expressions. Furthermore, TQ treatment led to the inhibition of Integrin-β1, VEGF, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in TNBC cells.


CONCLUSION
TQ inhibits autophagic activity and expression of Beclin-1 and LC3 in TNBC cells and suppresses pathways related to cell migration/invasion and angiogenesis, including Integrin-β1, VEGF, MMP-2 and MMP-9, suggesting that TQ may be used to control autophagic activity and oncogenic signaling in TNBC."

Although diallyl disulfide (DADS), an important garlic (Allium sativum) derivative, has exhibited potential anticancer activity, the molecular mechanism of this activity remains unknown. In this study, we evaluated the antitumor activity of DADS in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines based in vitro and in vivo models.


METHODS AND RESULTS
We found that treatment with DADS resulted in decreased viability, increased apoptosis, and suppression of metastatic potential in TNBC cells. Furthermore, DADS induced dysregulation of B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 family members, downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and reversal of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Interestingly, DADS significantly inhibited activation of the β-catenin signaling pathway, which regulated Bcl-2 family members, MMP-9 and EMT in TNBC cells. Consistent with these in vitro findings, we also verified the anticancer potential of DADS in MDA-MB-231 xenograft mice. Treatment with DADS significantly reduced tumor volume and weight and increased apoptosis in these mice, while the expression of active β-catenin was decreased, and the downstream molecules were dysregulated.


CONCLUSION
Our results show that the antitumor effect of DADS on TNBC cells is mediated by the β-catenin pathway, suggesting that DADS could be used as a potential therapeutic agent for treating or preventing breast cancer."

Here we report on the inhibitory properties of [10]-gingerol against metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) in vitro and in vivo. We show that [10]-gingerol concentration-dependently induces apoptotic death in mouse and human TNBC cell lines in vitro. In addition, [10]-gingerol is well tolerated in vivo, induces a marked increase in caspase-3 activation and inhibits orthotopic tumour growth in a syngeneic mouse model of spontaneous breast cancer metastasis. Importantly, using both spontaneous and experimental metastasis assays, we show for the first time that [10]-gingerol significantly inhibits metastasis to multiple organs including lung, bone and brain. Remarkably, inhibition of brain metastasis was observed even when treatment was initiated after surgical removal of the primary tumour. Taken together, these results indicate that [10]-gingerol may be a safe and useful complementary therapy for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and warrant further investigation of its efficacy, either alone or in combination with standard systemic therapies, in pre-clinical models of metastatic breast cancer and in patients."

In current study, we found that miR-455-3p and miR-196a-5p were intensively overexpressed in TNBC compared with the hormone receptor (HR) positive breast cancer whereas miR-425-5p was down-regulated by miRNA microarray analysis. qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that the expression of miR-455-3p in TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 was higher than that in HR positive breast cancer cell line MCF-7(p<0.01). Functional experiments in vitro showed that miR-455-3p enhanced cell proliferative, invasive and migrational abilities in TNBC cell lines. miRNA targets prediction showed SMAD2, LTBR and etoposide induced 2.4 (EI24) were potential target genes of miR-455-3p, and then it was confirmed by qRT-PCR assay. Dual luciferase reporter assay showed the specific binding of miR-455-3p to 3′ UTR of EI24 in TNBC. Then we found miR-455-3p inhibited the EI24 expression at the levels of mRNA and protein. Through small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting EI24 gene, there were strengthened capabilities of invasion and migration of TNBC cells, and increased expression of EI24 had the inverse effects. In conclusion, the data suggest that miRNA455-3p promotes invasion and migration by targeting tumor suppressor EI24 and might be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in TNBC."

Experimental Design: We analyzed 165 TNBC samples and 33 paired normal breast tissues using transcriptome microarrays. Tumor-specific mRNAs and lncRNAs were identified and correlated with patients' recurrence-free survival (RFS). Using Cox regression model, we built two multigene signatures incorporating mRNAs and lncRNAs. The prognostic and predictive accuracy of the signatures were tested in a training set of 165 TNBC patients and validated in other 101 TNBC patients. Results: We successfully developed an mRNA and an integrated mRNA–lncRNA signature based on eight mRNAs and two lncRNAs. In the training set, patients in the high-risk group were more likely to suffer from recurrent disease than patients in the low-risk group in both signatures [HR, 10.00; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.53–39.47, P = 0.001; HR = 4.46, 95% CI, 1.34–14.91, P = 0.015 for integrated signature and mRNA signature, respectively). Results were validated in the validation set (P = 0.019 and 0.030, respectively). In addition, time-dependent receiver operating curve showed that the integrated mRNA–lncRNA signature had a better prognostic value than both the eight-mRNA-only signature and the clinicopathologic risk factors in both sets. We also found through interaction analysis that patients classified into the low-risk group by the integrated mRNA–lncRNA signature had a more favorable response to adjuvant taxane chemotherapy. Conclusions: The multigene signature we developed can accurately predict clinical outcome and benefit of taxane chemotherapy in TNBC patients. Clin Cancer Res; 22(7); 1653–62. ©2016 AACR."

New tumor-specific radiosensitizers are needed. We hypothesized that the ATR inhibitor, VX-970 (now known as M6620), would preferentially radiosensitize TNBC. Noncancerous breast epithelial and TNBC cell lines were investigated in clonogenic survival, cell cycle, and DNA damage signaling and repair assays. In addition, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models generated prospectively as part of a neoadjuvant chemotherapy study from either baseline tumor biopsies or surgical specimens with chemoresistant residual disease were assessed for sensitivity to fractionated radiotherapy, VX-970, or the combination. To explore potential response biomarkers, exome sequencing was assessed for germline and/or somatic alterations in homologous recombination (HR) genes and other alterations associated with ATR inhibitor sensitivity. VX-970 preferentially inhibited ATR-Chk1-CDC25a signaling, abrogated the radiotherapy-induced G2–M checkpoint, delayed resolution of DNA double-strand breaks, and reduced colony formation after radiotherapy in TNBC cells relative to normal-like breast epithelial cells. In vivo, VX-970 did not exhibit significant single-agent activity at the dose administered even in the context of genomic alterations predictive of ATR inhibitor responsiveness, but significantly sensitized TNBC PDXs to radiotherapy. Exome sequencing and functional testing demonstrated that combination therapy was effective in both HR-proficient and -deficient models. PDXs established from patients with chemoresistant TNBC were also highly radiosensitized. In conclusion, VX-970 is a tumor-specific radiosensitizer for TNBC. Patients with residual TNBC after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a subset at particularly high risk of relapse, may be ideally suited for this treatment intensification strategy.

As its nomenclature implies, TNBC lacks specific biomarker expression marking response to an effective targeted therapy. The incidence of TNBC is higher in young minority women who suffer from high rates of early recurrence and death from their disease. Mounting preclinical evidence supports targeting the Ras/MAPK cell signaling pathway in the TNBC subtype, despite large genomic surveys such as The Cancer Genome Atlas demonstrating infrequent canonical mutations in this pathway. Due to the early spread of TNBC, targeted treatment in the neoadjuvant setting may offer the effective therapeutic punch needed to eliminate micro-metastatic disease and reduce mortality. Herein, we will review the evidence supporting clinical trials of targeted inhibitors of the Ras/MAPK pathway in TNBC, and discuss the obstacles and opportunities of this approach."

We show that intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is differentially expressed in human TNBC tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry and in human TNBC cell lines via quantification of gene and protein expression. Iron oxide nanoparticles functionalized with ICAM-1 antibody (ICAM-IONP) were synthesized as MRI probes. An in vivo signal enhancement of 2.6-fold for ICAM-IONPs was measured relative to controls, demonstrating that ICAM-1 is a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for TNBC treatment. Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) have a high mortality rate owing to aggressive proliferation and metastasis and a lack of effective therapeutic options. Herein, we describe the overexpression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in human TNBC cell lines and tissues, and demonstrate that ICAM-1 is a potential molecular target and biomarker for TNBC therapy and diagnosis. We synthesized ICAM-1 antibody-conjugated iron oxide nanoparticles (ICAM-IONPs) as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probe to evaluate tumor targeting. Quantitative analysis of ICAM-1 surface expression predicted the targeting capability of ICAM-IONPs to TNBC cells. MRI of the TNBC xenograft tumor after systemic administration of ICAM-IONPs, coupled with iron quantification and histology, demonstrated a significant and sustained MRI contrast enhancement and probe accumulation in tumors with ICAM-1 overexpression relative to control. Identification of ICAM-1 as a TNBC target and biomarker may lead to the development of a new strategy and platform for addressing a critical gap in TNBC patient care."

It is desirable and beneficial to treat TNBC cells of different phenotypes with the most appropriate drugs. Here, we report a 78 nm, chlorin e6-, docetaxel-, and anti-Twist siRNA-containing polymeric nanoparticle (CDTN) with spatiotemporally specific activity when irradiated by light. Under conditions mimicking superficial tumor tissue with sufficient light input, TNBC cells are mainly killed by the photodynamic therapy (PDT) function of CDTNs. In contrast, under conditions mimicking deep tumor tissue with weak light input, PDT potentiates chemotherapy (CT) and gene therapy (GT) by facilitating the endolysosomal escape of CDTNs. Compared with free drugs, CDTNs improve the intratumoral exposure of docetaxel and anti-Twist siRNA by 2.5- and 2-fold, respectively. When combined with laser irradiation applied at the time of maximal intratumoral accumulation, the CDTNs significantly inhibit the growth of primary tumors and their lung metastasis (both >80%) by killing the peripheral cells, mainly through PDT and prohibiting the growth and metastasis of deep cells through PDT as enhanced CT and GT. On the contrary, dual-modality nanomedicine lacking CT, GT, or PDT showed fast primary tumor growth, poor metastasis control, or both, respectively. This study reveals the spatiotemporally specific mechanism of CDTNs in treating metastatic TNBC and highlights the importance of combined therapy in treating TNBC."

To investigate parameters based on fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging that are best correlated with pathologic complete response (PCR) in human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-positive cancer and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and with partial or complete response in ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was approved by institutional review board with waivers of informed written consent and included consecutive patients treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Five PET examination-derived parameters were tested: standard uptake value (SUV) maximum (SUV(max)), peak (SUV(peak)), and mean (SUV(mean)), metabolically active tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis (TLG). Absolute values at baseline PET, at PET imaging after two cycles of chemotherapy, and variation (ie, change) were measured. Correlations with pathologic response (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) and predictive power assessed (area under the curve [AUC] on the basis of receiver operating characteristic analysis) were examined.


RESULTS
Included were 169 consecutive patients (mean age, 50 years). PCR was more frequent in HER2-positive tumors (16 of 33 patients [48.5%]) and TNBCs (20 of 54 patients [37%]) than in ER positive/HER2-negative tumors (four of 82 [4.9%]) (P < .001). Among patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative cancers, 33 patients had partial response. In TNBC, best association with PCR was obtained with change in SUV(max) (AUC, 0.86) or change in TLG (AUC, 0.88). In HER2-positive phenotype, absolute SUV(max) (or SUV(peak)) values at PET imaging after two cycles of chemotherapy (AUC for each cycle, 0.93) were better correlated with PCR than change in SUV(max) (AUC, 0.78; P = .11) or change in TLG (AUC, 0.62; P = .005). Regarding ER-positive/HER2-negative cancers, change in SUV(max) or change in TLG (AUC, 0.75) were parameters best correlated with partial or complete response. Baseline SUV(max) was higher in lymph nodes than in primary tumor in 31 patients. Findings were similar considering the site with highest FDG uptake.


CONCLUSION
Quantitative indexes of tumor glucose use that are best correlated with pathologic response vary by phenotype: change in SUV(max) or TLG are most adequate for TNBCs and ER-positive/ HER2-negative cancers and absolute SUV(max) after two cycles of chemotherapy for HER2-positive breast cancers."

Thus, TNBC patients cannot benefit from hormone receptor-targeted therapy as non-TNBC patients, but can only receive chemotherapy as the systemic treatment and have a worse overall outcome. More effective therapeutic targets and combination therapy strategies are urgently needed to improve the treatment effectiveness. Methods: We analyzed the expression levels of EZH2 and TET1 in TCGA and our own breast cancer patient cohort, and tested their correlation with patient survival. We used TNBC and non-TNBC cell lines and mouse xenograft tumor model to unveil novel EZH2 targets and investigated the effect of EZH2 inhibition or TET1 overexpression in cell proliferation and viability of TNBC cells. Results: In TNBC cells, EZH2 decreases TET1 expression by H3K27me3 epigenetic regulation and subsequently suppresses anti-tumor p53 signaling pathway. Patients with high EZH2 and low TET1 presented the poorest survival outcome. Experimentally, targeting EZH2 in TNBC cells with specific inhibitor GSK343 or shRNA genetic approach could induce cell cycle arrest and senescence by elevating TET1 expression and p53 pathway activation. Using mouse xenograft model, we have tested a novel therapy strategy to combine GSK343 and chemotherapy drug Adriamycin and could show drastic and robust inhibition of TNBC tumor growth by synergistic induction of senescence and apoptosis. Conclusions: We postulate that the well-controlled dynamic pathway EZH2-H3K27me3-TET1 is a novel epigenetic co-regulator module and provide evidence regarding how to exploit it as a novel therapeutic target via its pivotal role in senescence and apoptosis control. Of clinical and therapeutic significance, the present study opens a new avenue for TNBC treatment by targeting the EZH2-H3K27me3-TET1 pathway that can modulate the epigenetic landscape."

The small noncoding RNAs (miRNAs) considered as master regulator of gene expression play a key role in cancer initiation, progression and drug resistance and have emerged as attractive molecular biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment targets in cancer. We have done expression profiling of selected miRNAs in paired serum and tissue samples of TNBC patients and corresponding cell lines and compared with that of other subtypes, in order to identify novel serum miRNA biomarkers for early detection and progression of TNBC. A total of 85 paired tumor tissues and sera with an equal number of adjacent normal tissue margins and normal sera from age matched healthy women including tissue and sera samples from 15 benign fibroadenomas were employed for the study. We report for the first time an extremely high prevalence (73.9%) of TNBC in premenopausal women below 35 years of age and a significant altered expression of a panel of three specific oncogenic miRNAs- miR-21, miR-221, miR-210, and three tumor suppressor miRNAs- miR-195, miR-145 and Let-7a in both tissues and corresponding sera of TNBC patients when compared with triple positive breast cancer (TPBC) patients. While miR-21, miR-221 and miR-210 showed significant over-expression, miR-195 and miR-145 were downregulated and well correlated with various clinicopathological and demographic risk factors, tumor grade, clinical stage and hormone receptor status. Interestingly, despite being a known tumor suppressor, Let-7a showed a significant overexpression in TNBCs. It is suggested that this panel of six miRNA signature may serve as a minimally invasive biomarker for an early detection of TNBC patients."

Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an enzyme which catalyzes the methylation of arginines on histone and non‐histone proteins, has recently emerged as a putative target for cancer therapy. Potent and specific PRMT5 inhibitors have been developed, but the therapeutic efficacy of PRMT5 targeting in TNBC has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we examine the expression of PRMT5 in a human breast cancer cohort obtained from the Institut Curie, and evaluate the therapeutic potential of pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in TNBC. We find that PRMT5 mRNA and protein are expressed at comparable levels in TNBC, luminal breast tumors, and healthy mammary tissues. However, immunohistochemistry analyses reveal that PRMT5 is differentially localized in TNBC compared to other breast cancer subtypes and to normal breast tissues. PRMT5 is heterogeneously expressed in TNBC and high PRMT5 expression correlates with poor prognosis within this breast cancer subtype. Using the small‐molecule inhibitor EPZ015666, we show that PRMT5 inhibition impairs cell proliferation in a subset of TNBC cell lines. PRMT5 inhibition triggers apoptosis, regulates cell cycle progression and decreases mammosphere formation. Furthermore, EPZ015666 administration to a patient‐derived xenograft model of TNBC significantly deters tumor progression. Finally, we reveal potentiation between EGFR and PRMT5 targeting, suggestive of a beneficial combination therapy. Our findings highlight a distinctive subcellular localization of PRMT5 in TNBC, and uphold PRMT5 targeting, alone or in combination, as a relevant treatment strategy for a subset of TNBC."

However, the role of VM-initiating cells remains poorly understood. Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) are positively correlated with VM. In this study, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) enriched with CSCs was used to investigate the relationship between VM and CSCs. Methods The expression of several CSC markers was detected by immunohistochemistry in 100 human breast cancer samples. The clinical significance of CSC markers and the relationship between VM, CSCs, breast cancer subtypes, and VM-associated proteins were analyzed. CD133+ and ALDH+ human and mouse TNBC cells were isolated by FACS to examine the ability of VM formation and the spatial relationship between VM and CSCs. Results CSCs were associated with TNBC subtype and VM in human invasive breast cancer. CSCs in TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells formed more VM channels and expressed more molecules promoting VM than the non-TNBC MCF-7 cells in vitro. MDA-MB-231 cells that encircled VM channels on Matrigel expressed CD133. Moreover, CSCs were located near VM channels in the 3D reconstructed blood supply system in human TNBC grafts. The CD133+ and ALDH+ cells isolated from TA2 mouse breast cancer formed more VM channels in vivo. Conclusions CSCs line VM channels directly. Additionally, CSCs provide more VM-related molecules to synergize VM formation. The signaling pathways that control CSC differentiation may also be potential treatment targets for TNBC."

Although overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently found in TNBC, the therapeutic effect of EGFR inhibitors in TNBC has been underwhelming. Here we show that co-treatment with clinically validated inhibitors of c-ABL (imatinib) and EGFR (lapatinib) results in synergistic growth inhibition in TNBC cells. The dual treatment leads to synergistic repression of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HOTAIR (HOX Antisense Intergenic RNA). HOTAIR has been known to induce tumor growth and metastasis in breast cancer. Depleting HOTAIR alone phenocopies the dual treatment in growth suppression. We show that expression of HOTAIR is regulated by β-catenin through a LEF1/TCF4-binding site. The dual treatment blocks nuclear expression of β-catenin and prevents its recruitment to the HOTAIR promoter. Consistently, forced expression of β-catenin rescued HOTAIR expression and cell viability in the presence of both drugs. Upregulation of HOTAIR is associated with TNBC in cell lines and a cohort of primary tumors. This study elucidates a previously unidentified mechanism in TNBC linking signaling with lncRNA regulation which may be exploited for therapeutic gain."

Molecular subclassification of TNBCs is essential for optimal use of current therapies and for development of new drugs. microRNAs (miRNA) are widely recognized as key players in cancer progression and drug resistance; investigation of their involvement in a TNBC cohort may reveal biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of TNBC. Here we stratified a large TNBC cohort into Core Basal (CB, EGFR and/or CK5, 6 positive) and five negative (5NP) if all markers are negative. We determined the complete miRNA expression profile and found a subset of miRNAs specifically deregulated in the two subclasses. We identified a 4-miRNA signature given by miR-155, miR-493, miR-30e and miR-27a expression levels, that allowed subdivision of TNBCs not only into CB and 5NP subgroups (sensitivity 0.75 and specificity 0.56; AUC=0.74) but also into high risk and low risk groups. We tested the diagnostic and prognostic performances of both the 5 IHC marker panel and the 4-miRNA expression signatures, which clearly identify worse outcome patients in the treated and untreated subcohorts. Both signatures have diagnostic and prognostic value, predicting outcomes of patient treatment with the two most commonly used chemotherapy regimens in TNBC: anthracycline or anthracycline plus taxanes. Further investigation of the patients' overall survival treated with these regimens show that regardless of IHC group subdivision, taxanes addition did not benefit patients, possibly due to miRNA driven taxanes resistance. TNBC subclassification based on the 5 IHC markers and on the miR-155, miR-493, miR-30e, miR-27a expression levels are powerful diagnostic tools. Treatment choice and new drug development should consider this new subtyping and miRNA expression signature in planning low toxicity, maximum efficacy therapies."

However, the function of AR in TNBC and the mechanisms by which AR-targeted therapy reduces tumor burden are largely unknown. We hypothesized that AR maintains a cancer stem cell (CSC)-like tumor-initiating population and serves as an antiapoptotic factor, facilitating anchorage independence and metastasis. AR levels increased in TNBC cells grown in forced suspension culture compared with those in attached conditions, and cells that expressed AR resisted detachment-induced apoptosis. Culturing TNBC cells in suspension increased the CSC-like population, an effect reversed by AR inhibition. Pretreatment with enzalutamide (Enza) decreased the tumor-initiating capacity of TNBC cells and reduced tumor volume and viability when administered simultaneously or subsequent to the chemotherapeutic paclitaxel; simultaneous treatment more effectively suppressed tumor recurrence. Overall, our findings suggest that AR-targeted therapies may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy even in TNBCs with low AR expression by targeting a CSC-like cell population with anchorage independence and invasive potential.

Wnt/β-catenin signaling is hyperactivated in TNBC, which promotes the progression of TNBC. However, the molecular mechanism of Wnt/β-catenin activation in TNBC remains unknown. Here, we report the drastic overexpression of miR-221/222 in all of four TNBC cell lines and TNBC primary tumor samples from patients. Furthermore, we demonstrate by both ex vivo and xenograft experiments that inhibiting miR-221/222 expression in a TNBC cell line (MDA-MB-231) suppresses its proliferation, viability, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and migration; whereas expressing miR-221/222 in a non-TNBC line (MCF7) promotes all of the above cancer properties. miR-221/222 achieve so by directly repressing multiple negative regulators of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, including WIF1, SFRP2, DKK2, and AXIN2, to activate the pathway. Notably, the level of miR-221/222 expression is inversely correlated whereas that of WIF1, DKK2, SFRP2, and AXIN2 expression is positively correlated with the patient survival. Last, we show that anti-miR-221/222 significantly increases apoptotic cells with tamoxifen/Wnt3a treatment but not with cyclophosphamide/Wnt3a treatment.

However, reports suggest that higher glucose concentrations may negatively impact the anti-cancer efficacy of metformin. Therefore, we examined the anti-cancer potential of metformin in triple-negative breast cancer cells (TNBCs) exposed to different glucose (25 mM, 5.5 mM and zero glucose/glucose-starved) conditions. Our data indicates that a high glucose (25 mM) concentration (mimicking diabetes) significantly abrogated the effect of metformin on cell proliferation, cell death and cell cycle arrest in addition to loss of efficacy in inhibition of the mTOR pathway, a key metabolic pathway in TNBC cells. The mTOR pathway is activated in TNBCs compared to other subtypes of breast cancer, regulates the synthesis of proteins that are critical for the growth and survival of cancer cells and its activation is correlated to poor outcomes among TNBC patients, while also contributing to metastatic progression and development of resistance to chemotherapy/radiotherapy. Our studies were performed in two different types of TNBCs, MDA-MB-231 cells (mesenchymal stem cell-like (MSL)) and MDA-MB-468 (basal like-1 (BL-1)). Interestingly, lower concentrations of metformin (50, 100, 250, and 500 μM) significantly increased cell proliferation in 25 mM glucose exposed MDA-MB-231 cells, an effect which was not observed in MDA-MB-468 cells, indicating that the effective concentration of metformin when used as anti-cancer drug in TNBCs may have to be determined based on cell type and blood glucose concentration. Our data indicates that metformin treatment was most effective under zero glucose/glucose-starved conditions in MDA-MB-468 with a significant increase in the apoptotic population (62.3 ± 1.5%; p-value < 0.01). Under 5.5 mM glucose conditions in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells our data showed reduced viability of 73.56 ± 2.53%; p-value < 0.05 and 70.49 ± 1.68%; p-value < 0.001, respectively, along with a significant increase in apoptotic populations of both cell types. Furthermore, metformin (2 mM) inhibited the mTOR pathway and its downstream components under zero glucose/glucose-starved conditions indicating that using metformin in combination with agents that inhibit the glycolytic pathway should be more beneficial for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancers in diabetic individuals."

However, this is rapidly changing due to a variety of conceptually important clinical trials and emerging new options such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates. Evidence also increasingly supports that platinum drugs and inhibitors of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, or PARP, are particularly effective in the treatment of germline BRCA-mutant cancers, including TNBC. An important development in early-stage TNBC was the recognition that extensive residual cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy identifies patients who remain at high risk for recurrence. This has led to the design of two ongoing adjuvant trials (one testing pembrolizumab, the other investigating platinum drugs and capecitabine) that offer a ""second chance"" to improve the survival of patients with residual cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Genomic analysis of TNBC has revealed large-scale transcriptional, mutational, and copy number heterogeneity, without any frequently recurrent mutations, other than TP53. Consistent with this molecular heterogeneity, most targeted agents, so far, have demonstrated low overall activity in unselected TNBC, but important ""basket"" trials are ongoing."

Here, we demonstrated the inhibitory effect of berberine (BBR) on tumor growth and metastasis of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells via suppression of TGF-β1 expression. Methods: The levels of mRNA expression were analyzed by real-time PCR. The levels of MMP-2, MMP-9 and TGF-β1 protein expression were analyzed by zymography and confocal microscopy, respectively. Cell migration was analyzed by wound healing assay. Tumorigenicity of TNBC cells such as tumor growth and metastasis was analyzed using xenograft models. Results: In a clinical data set, aberrant TGF-β1 expression was associated with poor prognosis of breast cancer patients. Our in vitro results using TNBC cells showed that the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 and the capacity for cell migration were increased by TGF-β1 treatment. In contrast, basal levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were suppressed by a specific TGF-β receptor I inhibitor, SB431542. In addition, TGF-β1–induced MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and cell migration were decreased by SB431542. Interestingly, we showed for the first time that BBR decreased the level of TGF-β1, but not TGF-β2, in TNBC cells. Furthermore, BBR significantly decreased the level of MMP-2 expression as well as the capacity for cell migration in TNBC cells. Finally, we examined the effect of BBR on in vivo tumor growth and lung metastasis in MDA-MB231 and 4T1 breast cancer xenograft models and showed that both were significantly decreased following BBR treatment. Conclusion: BBR suppresses tumorigenicity of TNBC cells through inhibition of TGF-β1 expression. Therefore, we demonstrate that BBR could be a promising drug for treatment of TNBC."

Acquired chemoresistance is a major clinical challenge for TNBC patients. Previously, we reported that kinase‐dead Aurora kinase A (Aurora‐A) could effectively transactivate the FOXM1 promoter. Here, we demonstrate an additional pathway through which Aurora‐A stabilizes FOXM1 by attenuating its ubiquitin in TNBC. Specifically, Aurora‐A stabilizes FOXM1 in late M phase and early G1 phase of the cell cycle, which promotes proliferation of TNBC cells. Knock‐down of Aurora‐A significantly suppresses cell proliferation in TNBC cell lines and can be rescued by FOXM1 overexpression. We observe that paclitaxel‐resistant TNBC cells exhibit high expression of Aurora‐A and FOXM1. Overexpression of Aurora‐A offers TNBC cells an additional growth advantage and protection against paclitaxel. Moreover, Aurora‐A and FOXM1 could be simultaneously targeted by thiostrepton. Combination of thiostrepton and paclitaxel treatment reverses paclitaxel resistance and significantly inhibits cell proliferation. In conclusion, our study reveals additional mechanism through which Aurora‐A regulates FOXM1 and provides a new therapeutic strategy to treat paclitaxel‐resistant triple‐negative breast cancer."

Using a SOX2/OCT4 promoter reporter, we identified a population of miR-708low cancer cells with tumor-initiating properties, enhanced metastatic potential, and marked sensitivity to miR-708 treatment. In vivo, miR708-NP directly targeted the SOX2/OCT4-mCherry+ miR-708low tumor cells to impair metastasis.

The protease cathepsin D (cath-D) is a marker of poor prognosis in TNBC and a tumor-specific extracellular target for antibody-based therapy. The identification of cath-D substrates is crucial for the mechanistic understanding of its role in the TNBC microenvironment and future therapeutic developments. Methods: The cath-D substrate repertoire was investigated by N-Terminal Amine Isotopic Labeling of Substrates (TAILS)-based degradome analysis in a co-culture assay of TNBC cells and breast fibroblasts. Substrates were validated by amino-terminal oriented mass spectrometry of substrates (ATOMS). Cath-D and SPARC expression in TNBC was examined using an online transcriptomic survival analysis, tissue micro-arrays, TNBC cell lines, patient-derived xenografts (PDX), human TNBC samples, and mammary tumors from MMTV-PyMT Ctsd-/-knock-out mice. The biological role of SPARC and its fragments in TNBC were studied using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analysis, gene expression knockdown, co-culture assays, western blot analysis, RT-quantitative PCR, adhesion assays, Transwell motility, trans-endothelial migration and invasion assays. Results: TAILS analysis showed that the matricellular protein SPARC is a substrate of extracellular cath-D. In vitro, cath-D induced limited proteolysis of SPARC C-terminal extracellular Ca2+ binding domain at acidic pH, leading to the production of SPARC fragments (34-, 27-, 16-, 9-, and 6-kDa). Similarly, cath-D secreted by TNBC cells cleaved fibroblast- and cancer cell-derived SPARC at the tumor pericellular acidic pH. SPARC cleavage also occurred in TNBC tumors. Among these fragments, only the 9-kDa SPARC fragment inhibited TNBC cell adhesion and spreading on fibronectin, and stimulated their migration, endothelial transmigration, and invasion. Conclusions: Our study establishes a novel crosstalk between proteases and matricellular proteins in the tumor microenvironment through limited SPARC proteolysis, revealing a novel targetable 9-kDa bioactive SPARC fragment for new TNBC treatments. Our study will pave the way for the development of strategies for targeting bioactive fragments from matricellular proteins in TNBC."

Unlike hormone receptor-positive or HER2-positive breast cancers, there are limited targeted therapies available to treat TNBC and cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment. Sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU-132) is an antibody-drug conjugate targeting Trop-2 expressing cells and selectively delivering SN-38, an active metabolite of irinotecan. Areas covered: This review covers the mechanism of action, safety and efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan in patients with previously treated, metastatic TNBC. Additionally, efficacy data in other epithelial malignancies is included based on a PubMed search for ‘sacituzumab govitecan’ and ‘clinical trial’. Expert opinion: Sacituzumab govitecan has promising anti-cancer activity in patients with metastatic TNBC previously treated with at least two prior lines of systemic therapy based on a single arm Phase I/II clinical trial. A confirmatory Phase III randomized clinical trial is ongoing. Sacituzumab govitecan has a manageable side effect profile, with the most common adverse events being nausea, neutropenia, and diarrhea. The activity of sacituzumab govitecan likely extends beyond TNBC with promising early efficacy data in many other epithelial cancers, including hormone receptor-positive breast cancer."

Although TNBC is sensitive to chemotherapy, the recurrence and mortality rates are worse compared with the other breast cancer types. In addition, TNBC still lacks targeted treatment options. With the improved understanding of the immune system in TNBC, it is expected that new predictive and prognostic markers will be identified, and innovative treatment modalities will be developed. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of the effector cells in the TNBC's microenvironment and to highlight a novel approach to treat this kind of cancer. A computer‐based literature research was carried out using PubMed, American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting (ASCO) and San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS). To date, studies have shown that tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) play a very important role in the TNBC's microenvironment. Tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes can even be considered as biomarkers to predict chemotherapy response in TNBC. Furthermore, TNBC was shown to have immune active subtypes, and therefore, the use of immunotherapy may be an attractive treatment approach. In this respect, several randomized studies have been designed or are currently ongoing to explore the combination of chemotherapy with immunotherapy in TNBC. Combination of chemo‐ and immunotherapy is likely to be beneficial in a subgroup of patients with TNBC."

The activation of this pathway leads to the expression of specific target genes depending on the cell/tissue context. Here, we analyzed the transcriptome of two different TNBC cell lines to define a comprehensive list of Wnt target genes. The treatment of cells with Wnt3a for 6h up-regulated the expression (fold change > 1.3) of 59 genes in MDA-MB-468 cells and 241 genes in HCC38 cells. Thirty genes were common to both cell lines. Beta-catenin may also be a transcriptional repressor and we found that 18 and 166 genes were down-regulated in response to Wnt3a treatment for 6h in MDA-MB-468 and HCC38 cells, respectively, of which six were common to both cell lines. Only half of the activated and the repressed transcripts have been previously described as Wnt target genes. Therefore, our study reveals 137 novel genes that may be positively regulated by Wnt3a and 104 novel genes that may be negatively regulated by Wnt3a. These genes are involved in the Wnt pathway itself, and also in TGFβ, p53 and Hedgehog pathways. Thorough characterization of these novel potential Wnt target genes may reveal new regulators of the canonical Wnt pathway. The comparison of our list of Wnt target genes with those published in other cellular contexts confirms the notion that Wnt target genes are tissue-, cell line- and treatment-specific. Genes up-regulated in Wnt3a-stimulated cell lines were more strongly expressed in TNBC than in luminal A breast cancer samples. These genes were also overexpressed, but to a much lesser extent, in HER2+ and luminal B tumors. We identified 72 Wnt target genes higher expressed in TNBCs (17 with a fold change >1.3) which may reflect the chronic activation of the canonical Wnt pathway that occurs in TNBC tumors."

To identify new therapeutic targets in TNBC, we performed a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen for protein kinases commonly amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer. Using this approach, we identified AKT3 as a gene preferentially required for the growth of TNBCs. Downregulation of Akt3 significantly inhibits the growth of TNBC lines in three-dimensional (3D) spheroid cultures and in mouse xenograft models, whereas loss of Akt1 or Akt2 have more modest effects. Akt3 silencing markedly upregulates the p27 cell-cycle inhibitor and this is critical for the ability of Akt3 to inhibit spheroid growth. In contrast with Akt1, Akt3 silencing results in only a minor enhancement of migration and does not promote invasion. Depletion of Akt3 in TNBC sensitizes cells to the pan-Akt inhibitor GSK690693. These results imply that Akt3 has a specific function in TNBCs; thus, its therapeutic targeting may provide a new treatment option for this tumor subtype."

Here, we found that inducible IκB kinase-related (IKK-related) kinase IKBKE expression and JAK/STAT pathway activation compose a cytokine signaling network in the immune-activated subset of TNBC. We found that treatment of cultured IKBKE-driven breast cancer cells with CYT387, a potent inhibitor of TBK1/IKBKE and JAK signaling, impairs proliferation, while inhibition of JAK alone does not. CYT387 treatment inhibited activation of both NF-κB and STAT and disrupted expression of the protumorigenic cytokines CCL5 and IL-6 in these IKBKE-driven breast cancer cells. Moreover, in 3D culture models, the addition of CCL5 and IL-6 to the media not only promoted tumor spheroid dispersal but also stimulated proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. Interruption of cytokine signaling by CYT387 in vivo impaired the growth of an IKBKE-driven TNBC cell line and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). A combination of CYT387 therapy with a MEK inhibitor was particularly effective, abrogating tumor growth and angiogenesis in an aggressive PDX model of TNBC.

Immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors has emerged as an effective therapeutic option for TNBC. The results of the IMpassion130 trial have recently led to the approval of the combination of atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel in the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic, PD-L1-positive TNBC. Areas covered This article summarizes the clinical development and ongoing research on atezolizumab in the treatment of metastatic TNBC. Results of atezolizumab monotherapy trials and data from combination studies with chemotherapy in the advanced setting are reviewed, with special focus on the design, methods, and key findings of the IMpassion130 trial. Expert opinion The approval of atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel represents an important advance in the treatment of metastatic TNBC. This combination has a favorable risk-benefit profile and is associated with clinically meaningful outcomes. However, further research is needed to identify better predictive biomarkers of response as well as novel immunotherapeutic strategies with atezolizumab and other anticancer drugs."

Treatment of breast cancer mainly depends on chemotherapy, due to the lack of specifically approved targeted therapies for TNBC. It is of paramount importance to find new therapeutic approaches, as resistance to chemotherapy frequently occurs. Herein, we present clinical studies published within the last five years, in order to reveal possible targeted therapies against TNBC. We aimed to discuss factors against TNBC, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, anti-androgens, poly ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) inhibitors, anti-angiogenic factors, immune checkpoints and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI). Furthermore, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway seems to be a promising field for the development of new anti-TNBC targeted therapies. Data from 18 clinical trials with patients suffering from TNBC were summarized and presented descriptively."

To evaluate the risk of locoregional recurrence (LRR) associated with locoregional treatment of women with primary breast cancer tumors negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (triple-negative breast cancer [TNBC]).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients diagnosed with TNBC were identified from a cancer registry in a single institution (n=768). LRR-free survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to determine risk of LRR on the basis of locoregional management: breast-conserving therapy (BCT; ie, lumpectomy and adjuvant radiation therapy [RT]) and modified radical mastectomy (MRM) in the TNBC population and T1-2N0 subgroup.


RESULTS
At a median follow-up of 7.2 years, 77 patients (10%) with TNBC developed LRR. Five-year LRR-free survival was 94%, 85%, and 87% in the BCT, MRM, and MRM + RT groups, respectively (P < .001). In multivariate analysis, MRM (compared with BCT), lymphovascular invasion and lymph node positivity were associated with increased LRR. Conversely, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with decreased risk of LRR. For patients with T1-2N0 tumors, 5-year LRR-free survival was 96% and 90% in the BCT and MRM groups, respectively (P = .027), and MRM was the only independent prognostic factor associated with increased LRR compared with BCT (hazard ratio, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.12 to 5.75; P = .0264).


CONCLUSION
Women with T1-2N0 TNBC treated with MRM without RT have a significant increased risk of LRR compared with those treated with BCT. Prospective studies are warranted to investigate the benefit of adjuvant RT after MRM in TNBC."

TNBC is the most difficult breast cancer subgroup to treat, due to its unresponsiveness to current clinical targeted therapies, high rate of recurrence, and poor prognosis. Thus, there is an urgent medical need to identify therapeutic targets and develop more effective stratified medicine for the treatment of TNBC. Here we review the potential therapeutic targets for TNBC based on its intrinsic subtype. We also review the aberrant activated signals found in different subgroups of TNBC, including androgen receptor (AR) and PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Notch, Wnt/β-catenin, Hedge-hog, and TGF-β signaling pathways, which play essential roles in multiple development stages of TNBC. The careful analysis of these signaling pathways and therapeutic targets would have significant impact on the drug development and clinical trials, leading to effective therapies for this deadly disease."

Here, we report the effects on apoptosis and autophagy in human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines after treatment with cantharidin and attempt to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Methods: MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with cantharidin and cell proliferation was examined using CCK-8 and clone formation assays. The expression of apoptosis- and autophagy-associated proteins was detected by western blotting. Cells were infected with lentivirus carrying the Beclin-1 gene, and MDA-MB-231-beclin1 (MB231-Bec) and MDA-MB-468-beclin-1(MB468-Bec) cells stably expressing Beclin-1 were established. Autophagic vacuoles in cells were observed with LC3 staining using fluorescence microscopy, and apoptotic cells were detected via flow cytometry. Tumor growth was assessed by subcutaneous inoculation of TNBC cells into BALB/c nude mice. Results: Cantharidin inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, and induced cell apoptosis. Cantharidin additionally inhibited the conversion of LC3 I to LC3 II and autophagosome formation by suppressing the expression of Beclin-1. Furthermore, overexpression of Beclin-1 in TNBC cells attenuated the cytotoxicity of cantharidin. In vivo, cantharidin inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 xenografts in nude mice by suppressing autophagy and inducing apoptosis, and Beclin-1 overexpression in TNBC cells reduced the efficacy of cantharidin. Conclusions: Cantharidin inhibits autophagy by suppressing Beclin-1 expression and inducing apoptosis of TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo, thereby representing a potential strategy for the treatment of TNBC."

Because triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most refractory to current anti-cancer therapies, efficient treatment has been urgently required. Members of the Bcl-2 family play pro- and anti-apoptotic roles in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Some Bcl-2 family members are expressed in breast cancer and influence the response to anti-cancer therapies. In this study, we investigated whether Bcl-2 inhibition could sensitize TNBC cells to the genotoxic drug doxorubicin (DR). Treatment with a combination of the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-199 and DR synergistically decreased the viability of the TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and BT-549. In an apoptosis assay, the combination treatment resulted in only a marginal effect in BT-549 cells, whereas drastic apoptosis was induced in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with both ABT-199 and DR. Both caspase-8 and -9 were involved in the combination treatment-induced apoptosis. Short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Bcl-2 increased the sensitivity of both cell lines to DR. The combination treatment also significantly decreased the colony-forming ability of the TNBC cell lines. In a xenograft mouse model, oral administration of ABT-199 augmented the DR-induced antitumor effect on subcutaneously established MDA-MB-231 cells. These results indicate that the combination of DR with Bcl-2 inhibitors, including ABT-199, may be a promising treatment modality for TNBC patients."

Triple-negative breast cancer is one of the most aggressive types of breast cancer as it has the worst clinical outcome for patients. microRNAs are a type of small non-coding RNA and play an important role in breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential function and mechanism of miR-143-3p in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). MTT and colony formation assays, the effect of miR-143-3p modulation on MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation, revealed that increased miR-143-3p expression inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells. Moreover, miR-143-3p overexpression inhibited the movement of MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells in wound healing and transwell assays. To identify a potential miR-143-3p target, we investigated the effect of miR-143-3p modulation on LIMK1 expression level. Increased miR-143-3p expression caused a reduction in LIMK1 mRNA and protein, suggesting that LIMK1 is a target of miR-143-3p. In addition, dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that LIMK1 is a target gene of miR-143-3p. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that miR-143-3p arrested MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells at the G0/G1 phase. The TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database demonstrated that miR-143-3p was down-regulated in breast cancer tissues compared with normal breast tissues. These data demonstrated that miR-143-3p functioned as a suppressor gene in TNBC and that miR-143 targeted therapy may be a new strategy for TNBC treatment."
Role of Wnt Co‐Receptor LRP6 in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cell Migration and Invasion,"[{'authorId': '10660753', 'name': 'Jinlu Ma'}, {'authorId': '1715363', 'name': 'Wenyan Lu'}, {'authorId': '50536386', 'name': 'Dongquan Chen'}, {'authorId': '143778543', 'name': 'Bo Xu'}, {'authorId': '1918733789', 'name': 'Yonghe Li'}]",61,2017,4ea5c87aa77f779ee10468da1453da4a5373c88f,"The low‐density lipoprotein receptor‐related protein 6 (LRP6) is an essential Wnt co‐receptor of the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway. Although studies have shown an increased expression of LRP6 in several types of cancer, its function in tumor development and progression remains to be elucidated. We herein demonstrated that LRP6 expression is up‐regulated in human triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients and human TNBC cell lines, and that knockdown of LRP6 expression and treatment of recombinant Mesd protein (a specific inhibitor of LRP6) significantly decreased cell migration and invasion of TNBC MDA‐MB‐231 and BT549 cells. Interestingly, the effects of LRP6 knockdown and Mesd treatment on TNBC cell migration and invasion were more prominent than on TNBC cell proliferation/viability. Mechanistically, LRP6 knockdown and Mesd treatment inhibited Wnt/β‐catenin signaling and decreased the expression of S100A4, a mediator of cancer metastasis and a specific target of Wnt/β‐catenin signaling, in TNBC cells. Together, our data suggest that LRP6 promotes TNBC cell migration and invasion by regulating the expression and function of S100A4 via the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway. J. Cell.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play critical roles in tumorigenesis. In the present study, we aimed to explore the potential regulatory mechanism of circRNA_069718 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
CircRNA_069718 expression levels in TNBC tissues and cell lines were determined by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). In vitro function assays were used to determine the functional roles of circRNA_069718 in TNBC and were explored by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation assay, transwell assay, and flow cytometric analysis. QRT-PCR and Western blot were used to explore the effects of circRNA_0023642 on the expression of Wnt/β-catenin pathway-related genes.


RESULTS
We found that circRNA_069718 expression was significantly increased in TNBC tissues and cell lines. High circRNA_069718 expression was significantly correlated with advanced TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor overall survival of TNBC patients. Functionally, we showed that circRNA_069718 inhibition significantly reduced TNBC cells proliferation and invasion ability in vitro. Mechanically, we found that circRNA_069718 inhibition reduced the expression levels of Wnt/β-catenin pathway-related genes (β-catenin, c-myc, and cyclin D1).


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggested that circRNA_069718 promoted TNBC progression via Wnt/β-catenin pathway and could serve as a novel therapeutic target for TNBC treatment."

Emerging evidence has indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play pivotal roles in the development and progression of multiple cancers. Although there are substantial studies revealing that lung cancer-associated transcript 1 (LUCAT1) functions as a tumor promotor in various human cancers, the molecular mechanism of LUCAT1 in TNBC remains largely to be explored. In our study, we identified that LUCAT1 expression was dramatically enhanced in TNBC samples and cells. High LUCAT1 expression was strongly associated with advanced stages and poor prognosis of TNBC. LUCAT1 contributed to TNBC development through accelerating cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and metastasis as well as attenuating cell apoptosis. Moreover, miR-5702 was proved to directly bind to LUCAT1 and be negatively modulated by LUCAT1. Knockdown of miR-5702 reversed the suppressing influences of LUCAT1 depletion on TNBC progression. In conclusion, it was the first investigation to shed light on the significant function and underlying regulatory mechanism of LUCAT1 in TNBC tumorigenesis. We validated that LUCAT1 induced tumorigenesis and metastasis of TNBC via miR-5702, which provided clues for improving the treatment of TNBC."

Ruthenium (Ru)-based complexes have emerged as promising antitumor and antimetastatic substitutes for cisplatin. In this study, we demonstrated the effects of a Ru/biphosphine complex, containing gallic acid (GA) as a ligand, [Ru(GA)(dppe)2]PF6, hereafter called Ru(GA), on a TNBC cell line, and compared them to the effects in a nontumor breast cell line. Ru(GA) complex presented selective cytotoxicity against TNBC over nontumor cells, inhibited its migration and invasion, and induced apoptosis. These effects were associated with the increased amount of transferrin receptors (TfR) on tumor cells, compared to nontumor ones. Silencing of TfR decreased Ru(GA) effects on TNBC cells, demonstrating that these receptors were at least partially responsible for Ru(GA) delivery into tumor cells. The Ru(GA) compound must be further studied in different in vivo assays in order to investigate its antitumor properties and its toxicity in complex biological systems."

Therefore, hormone or targeted therapies are not effective in the treatment of TNBC and thus the development of novel therapeutic strategies is crucial. Methotrexate (MTX), a folate antagonist, has been used in the treatment of various types of cancer; however, the anticancer effects of MTX treatment on breast cancer have thus far been ineffective. Vitamin E variants and derivatives have been applied for cancer therapy. Previous studies have indicated that vitamin E variants and derivatives exert distinct anticancer effects on different types of cancer. However, whether MTX plus vitamin E variants or its derivatives can inhibit TNBC remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to examine the anticancer effects and mechanisms of action of MTX in combination with vitamin E variants (α‑tocopherol) and derivatives (α‑tocopherol succinate) on TNBC. In the present study, MTT assay and western blot analysis were used to determine the cell survival rates and protein levels. The results demonstrated that combination treatment with MTX and α‑tocopherol suppressed TNBC cell proliferation. In addition, various concentrations of MTX exerted distinct cytotoxic effects on α‑tocopherol succinate‑treated cells. Furthermore, high‑dose MTX enhanced α‑tocopherol succinate‑induced anticancer activity; however, low‑dose MTX inhibited α‑tocopherol succinate‑induced anticancer activity. The present study also demonstrated that caspase‑3 activation and poly(adenosine diphosphate‑ribose) polymerase cleavage were observed in the α‑tocopherol succinate/MTX‑treated cells.

This deadly disease represents a major challenge for successful treatment, in part because of the poor ability of drugs to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Antipsychotic drugs show good bioavailability in the brain, and some of them have exhibited anticancer effects in several cancer types. In this study, we investigated the potential of repurposing fluphenazine hydrochloride (Flu) for the treatment of TNBC and the brain metastases. Our data showed that Flu inhibited survival of metastatic TNBC cells. It induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and promoted mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptosis in vitro. Pharmacokinetic studies in BALB/c mice showed a brain/plasma drug concentration ratio of Flu above 25 for at least 24 hours after dosing. Flu moderately suppressed tumor growth in a TNBC subcutaneous xenograft mouse model. Importantly, Flu exhibited good anti-metastatic potential in a mouse brain metastasis model with an inhibition rate of 85%. In addition, Flu showed a strong inhibitory effect on spontaneous lung metastasis. Moreover, Flu didn't cause serious side effects in the mice. Taken together, this study prompts further preclinical and clinical investigation into repurposing Flu for treating metastatic TNBC patients, which urgently need new treatment options."

Improvement of their treatment, for all phases of the disease, is an important unmet medical need. We analyzed the effect of homoharringtonine (HHT), a natural protein synthesis inhibitor approved for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, on four cell lines representing aggressive, BRCA1/2 non-mutated, TNBC genomic categories. We show that HHT inhibits in vitro growth of all cell lines for more than 80%, after 48-72 h exposure to 20-100 ng/mL, the concentrations achievable in human plasma after subcutaneous administration of the drug. HHT, at 100 ng/mL, strongly reduced levels of a major TNBC survival factor, anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, after only 2 h of exposure, in all cell lines except MDA-MB-231. Other anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2, survivin and XIAP, were also strongly downregulated. Moreover, in vivo growth of the least sensitive cell line to HHT in vitro, MDA-MB-231, was inhibited for 36.5% in mice, by 1 mg/kg of the drug, given subcutaneously, bi-daily, over 7 days.

Lacking molecular targets, chemotherapy is the main adjuvant treatment for TNBC patients. Materials and methods To explore potential therapeutic targets for TNBC, we analyzed three microarray datasets (GSE38959, GSE45827, and GSE65194) derived from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The GEO2R tool was used to screen out differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between TNBC and normal tissue. Gene Ontology function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis were performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery to identify the pathways and functional annotation of DEGs. Protein–protein interaction of these DEGs was analyzed based on the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database and visualized by Cytoscape software. In addition, we used the online Kaplan–Meier plotter survival analysis tool to evaluate the prognostic value of hub genes expression in breast cancer patients. Results A total of 278 upregulated DEGs and 173 downregulated DEGs were identified. Among them, ten hub genes with a high degree of connectivity were picked out. Overexpression of these hub genes was associated with unfavorable prognosis of breast cancer, especially, CCNB1 overexpression was observed and indicated poor outcome of TNBC. Conclusion Our study suggests that CCNB1 was overexpressed in TNBC compared with normal breast tissue, and overexpression of CCNB1 was an unfavorable prognostic factor of TNBC patients. Further study is needed to explore the value of CCNB1 in the treatment of TNBC."

This study aimed to identify the key pathways and genes and find the potential initiation and progression mechanism of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Methods We downloaded the gene expression profiles of GSE76275 from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. This microarray Super-Series sets are composed of gene expression data from 265 samples which included 67 non-TNBC and 198 TNBC. Next, all the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with p<0.01 and fold change ≥1.5 or ≤-1.5 were identified. Result 56 upregulated and 151 downregulated genes were listed and the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) enrichment analysis was performed. These significantly changed genes were mainly involved in the biological process termed prostate gland morphogenesis, inner ear morphogenesis, cell maturation, digestive tract morphogenesis, autonomic nervous system development, monovalent inorganic anion homeostasis, neural crest cell development, regulation of dendrite extension and glial cell proliferation, immune system process termed T cell differentiation, regulation of immune response, and macrophage activation. Genes are mainly involved in the KEGG pathway termed Oocyte meiosis. All DEGs underwent survival analysis using datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) integrated by cBioPortal, of which amplification of SRY-related HMG-box 8 (SOX8), androgen receptor (AR), and Chromosome 9 Open Reading Frame 152 (C9orf152) were significantly negative while Nik Related Kinase (NRK) and RAS oncogene family 30 (RAB30) were positively correlated to the life expectancy (p<0.05). Conclusions In conclusion, these pathways and genes identified could help understanding the mechanism of development of TNBC. Besides, SOX8, AR, C9orf152, NRK and RAB30, and other key genes and pathways might be promising targets for the TNBC treatment."

While hormonal- and antibody-targeted therapies are effective in the patients with luminal and HER-2 subtypes, the patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype do not benefit from these therapies. The incidence rates of TNBC subtype are higher in African-American women, and the evidence indicates that these women have worse prognosis compared to women of European descent. The reasons for this disparity remain unclear but are often attributed to TNBC biology. In this study, we performed metabolic analysis of breast tissues to identify how TNBC differs from luminal A breast cancer (LABC) subtypes within the African-American and Caucasian breast cancer patients, respectively. We used High-Resolution Magic Angle Spinning (HR-MAS) 1H Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to perform the metabolomic analysis of breast cancer and adjacent normal tissues (total n=82 samples). TNBC and LABC subtypes in African American women exhibited different metabolic profiles. Metabolic profiles of these subtypes were also distinct from those revealed in Caucasian women. TNBC in African-American women expressed higher levels of glutathione, choline, and glutamine as well as profound metabolic alterations characterized by decreased mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolysis concomitant with decreased levels of ATP. TNBC in Caucasian women was associated with increased pyrimidine synthesis. These metabolic alterations could potentially be exploited as novel treatment targets for TNBC."

Unlike hormone receptor-positive subtypes, treatment of TNBC is currently limited by the lack of clinically available targeted therapies. Androgen signaling is necessary for normal breast development, and its dysregulation has been implicated in breast tumorigenesis. In recent years, gene expression studies have identified a subset of TNBC that is enriched for androgen receptor (AR) signaling. Interference with androgen signaling in TNBC is promising, and AR-inhibiting drugs have shown antitumorigenic activity in preclinical and proof of concept clinical studies. Recent advances in our understanding of androgenic signaling in TNBC, along with the identification of interacting pathways, are allowing development of the next generation of clinical trials with AR inhibitors. As novel AR-targeting agents are developed and evaluated in clinical trials, it is equally important to establish a robust set of biomarkers for identification of TNBC tumors that are most likely to respond to AR inhibition."

Palbociclib, a cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor is approved for metastatic estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and human epithermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. The nature of cell cycle inhibition by palbociclib suggests its potential in TNBC cells. Retinoblastoma (RB, a known substrate of CDK4/6) pathway deregulation is a frequent occurrence in TNBC and studies have revealed that pharmacological CDK4/6 inhibition induces a cooperative cytostatic effect with doxorubicin in RB-proficient TNBC models. In addition, recent studies reported that anti-androgen therapy shows preclinical efficacy in androgen-receptor (AR)-positive TNBC cells. Here we examined the effect of palbociclib in combination with an anti-androgen enzalutamide in TNBC cells. Method MDA-MB-453, BT-549, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cell lines were used for in vitro studies. Protein expressions were assessed by Western blot analysis. Cytostatic effect was examined by MTT assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis were examined by flow cytometry. Results Palbociclib showed inhibitory effect in RB-proficient TNBC cells, and enzalutamide inhibited cell viability in AR-positive TNBC cells. Enzalutamide treatment could enhance the palbociclib-induced cytostatic effect in AR-positive/RB-proficient TNBC cells. In addition, palbociclib-mediated G1 arrest in AR-positive/RB-proficient TNBC cells was attenuated by RB knockdown. Conclusion Our study provided a preclinical rationale in selecting patients who might have therapeutic benefit from combining CDK4/6 inhibitors with AR antagonists."

To identify potential therapeutic targets for TNBC, we conducted microRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) in human TNBC specimens and tumor-matched controls. We found that growth differentiation factor-10 (GDF10), a member of the TGF-β superfamily, was downregulated in tumor samples. Further analysis of GDF10 expression in a larger set of clinical TNBC samples using qPCR confirmed its downregulation and association with parameters of disease severity. Using human-derived TNBC cell lines, we carried out GDF10 under- and overexpression experiments, which showed that GDF10 loss promoted cell proliferation and invasion. By contrast, overexpression of GDF10 inhibited proliferation, invasion, and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) via upregulation of Smad7 and E-Cadherin, downregulation of p-Smad2 and N-Cadherin, and reduction of nuclear Smad4 expression. In addition, overexpression of GDF10 reduced tumor burden and induced apoptosis in a TNBC xenograft mouse model. These findings indicate that GDF10 acts as a tumor suppressor in mammary epithelial cells that limits proliferation and suppresses EMT. Efforts aimed at restoring GDF10 expression may thus bring a long-sought therapeutic alternative in the treatment of patients with TNBC."

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is primarily characterized by high heterogeneity and presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, remains therapeutic challenge due to unavailability of approved targeted therapy. Therapeutic potential of immune check point inhibitors for TNBC patients is under active clinical investigation. In this study, we show that FDA-approved anti-PD-L1 antibody, atezolizumab (ATE), potentiates T cell-mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis of TNBC cells that express higher levels of PD-L1, but does not have significant effect on TNBC cells expressing low levels of PD-L1. PD-L1 knockdown further confirmed that ability of ATE to promote T cell-induced cytotoxicity is PD-L1 expression dependent. Combination of ATE with PD-L1 upregulating agents, such as HDAC, proteasomal, and lysosomal inhibitors, further augmented cytotoxic activity of T cells toward TNBC cells. Based on analysis of breast cancer tissue samples deposited in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we found a positive correlation between PD-L1 and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) mRNA expression in PD-L1-positive (PD-L1+) TNBC, suggesting a functional association of FAK and immune checkpoints. We further demonstrate that ATE dramatically downregulates phosphorylation status of FAK, an important regulator of cell invasion and migration, and significantly enhances FAK inhibitor mediated inhibition of cell motility and invasion of PD-L1+ TNBC cells independent of T cells. Taken together, our data suggest that ATE shows promising anti-tumor activity in PD-L1+ TNBC via both T cell-dependent and -independent mechanisms."

Breast cancers arising from the luminal mammary duct often express estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2). Tumors expressing ER and/or PR are treated with anti-hormonal therapies, while tumors overexpressing HER2 are targeted with monoclonal antibodies. Immunohistochemical detection of ER, PR, and HER2 receptors/proteins is a critical step in breast cancer diagnosis and guided treatment. Breast tumors that do not express these proteins are known as “triple negative breast cancer” (TNBC) and are typically basal-like. TNBCs are the most aggressive subtype, with the highest mortality rates and no targeted therapy, so there is a pressing need to identify important TNBC tumor regulators. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) transcription factor has been previously implicated as a constitutively active oncogene in TNBC. However, its direct regulatory gene targets and tumorigenic properties have not been well characterized. By integrating RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data from 2 TNBC tumors and 5 cell lines, we discovered novel gene signatures directly regulated by STAT3 that were enriched for processes involving inflammation, immunity, and invasion in TNBC. Functional analysis revealed that STAT3 has a key role regulating invasion and metastasis, a characteristic often associated with TNBC. Our findings suggest therapies targeting STAT3 may be important for preventing TNBC metastasis."

Using a Cancer Landscapes-based analysis, a gene regulatory network model was constructed. The present results demonstrated that FOXM1 occupies a key position in gene networks and is a critical regulatory gene in breast cancer. Using breast carcinoma gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, it was identified that FOXM1 expression was increased in the basal-like breast cancer subtype compared with other breast cancer subtypes. RNA-sequencing analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 4 and 10 µl/ml Thiostrepton identified 662 and 5,888 significantly differentially expressed genes, respectively. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses demonstrated that FOXM1 was highly associated with multiple biological processes and was markedly associated with metabolic pathways in TNBC. The use of Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins provided a critical assessment and integration of protein-protein interactions, and demonstrated the multiple important functions of FOXM1 in TNBC. Real-time cell analysis, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence staining were used to assess the anti-tumor activity of Thiostrepton in TNBC cells in vitro. The present results identified that suppression of FOXM1 using Thiostrepton inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation and the expression of cell cycle-associated genes, including cyclin A2, cyclin B2, checkpoint kinase 1, centrosomal protein 55 and polo like kinase 1. Immunofluorescence staining analysis demonstrated that vimentin, filamentous actin and zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 were all decreased following treatment with Thiostrepton. Furthermore, a BALB/C nude mouse subcutaneous xenograft model was used to verify the function of FOXM1 in vivo. The present results demonstrated that FOXM1 inhibition significantly suppressed MDA-MB-231 cell tumorigenesis in vivo. Overall, the present results suggested that FOXM1 is a key gene that serves important roles in multiple biological processes in TNBC and that it may serve as a novel therapeutic target in TNBC."

TMAs from AAs had higher expression of ERβ and IGF2 expression when compared to CA. ERβ and IGF2 were found to be upregulated in our TNBC cell lines when compared to other cell types. TNBC cells treated with ERβ agonist displayed significant increase in cell proliferation and migration when compared to controls. AA tissue samples from TNBC patients had higher expression of ERβ. African-American breast cancer TNBC tissue samples from TNBC patients have higher expression of ERβ. In addition, TNBC cell lines were also found to express high levels of ERβ. IGF2 increased transcription of ERβ in TNBC cells. Understanding the mechanisms of IGF2/ERβ axis in TNBC tumors could provide an opportunity to target this aggressive subtype of breast cancer."

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease with subtypes having different ""targetable"" molecular aberrations. Metaplastic breast cancers (MpBCs) are typically TNBCs and commonly have alterations in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. We previously reported efficacy for an mTOR-based chemotherapy regimen in MpBC. To determine if tumor subtype influences prognosis, we compared treatment outcomes of patients with MpBC with those of patients with nonmetaplastic TNBC receiving an mTOR-based systemic therapy regimen.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients with advanced MpBC and nonmetaplastic TNBC were treated at our institution from April 16, 2009, through November 4, 2014, using mTOR inhibition (temsirolimus or everolimus) with liposomal doxorubicin and bevacizumab (DAT/DAE). Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate associations between tumor histology and outcomes. Multivariable models were adjusted for all covariates.


RESULTS
Fourteen patients with nonmetaplastic TNBC and 59 patients with advanced MpBC were treated with DAT/DAE. MpBC patients were older (p = .002) and less likely to have a history of bevacizumab use (p = .023). Median PFS for the nonmetaplastic TNBC and MpBC patients was 2.5 months and 4.8 months, respectively. This difference in PFS was statistically significant on univariable (p = .006) but not multivariable analysis (p = .087). Median OS for the nonmetaplastic TNBC and MpBC patients was 3.7 months and 10.0 months, respectively (p = .0003). MpBC remained significantly associated with improved OS on multivariable analysis (p < .0001).


CONCLUSION
In our study, DAT/DAE appeared to be more effective in MpBC compared with nonmetaplastic TNBC. These data support patient selection for targeted therapy in TNBC.


IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE
Metaplastic breast cancers (MpBCs) represent <1% of all breast cancers, demonstrate mesenchymal differentiation, and are typically resistant to chemotherapy. Patients with advanced MpBC treated with an mTOR-based systemic therapy regimen had better long-term outcomes compared with patients with nonmetaplastic triple-negative breast cancer treated with the same regimen, suggesting that metaplastic histology may predict benefit from agents targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway."

However, traditional chemotherapy drugs, such as doxorubicin (DOX), cause serious side effects and have a poor prognosis. Piperlongumine (PL), a natural alkaloid, has showed selective anticancer effects and is expected to become a new strategy against TNBC. In our research, cell viability, colony formation, flow cytometry, Western blot, and tumor xenograft model assays were established to evaluate the suppression effect of PL and DOX alone and in combination. Data showed that PL could effectively inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in two TNBC cell lines. We also demonstrated for the first time that the combination treatment of PL and DOX synergistically inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in TNBC cells. The suppression of STAT3 activation was indicated to be a mechanism of the anticancer effect. Moreover, the effectiveness of this combination was confirmed in a tumor xenograft model. These results revealed that inhibition of the JAK2-STAT3 pathway was a key anticancer mechanism when treated with PL alone or combined with DOX, suggesting that the combination of PL and chemotherapy drugs may be a potential strategy for the clinical treatment of TNBC."

However, it shows limited efficacy for human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Bevacizumab shows potent anti-angiogenesis activity, meanwhile, it also increases invasive and metastatic properties of TNBC cells by activiting Wnt/β-Catenin pathway. To overcome this problem, and fully utilize its potency against cancer, further synergistic strategy is recommended to be developed, especially the concurrent use with those Wnt-targeting agents. Here, by screening a small library of traditional Chinese medicine, we identified a Chinese herb derived Oxymatrine, which could target Wnt/β-Catenin signaling and compromise the oncogenic effects of Bevacizumab. Bevacizumab was validated to induce epithelial-mesenchymal cell transformation (EMT) and cancer stem-like properties of TNBC cells in hypoxia/nutritional stress environment. On the contrary, Oxymatrine reversed the EMT phenotype and depleted the subpopulation of TNBC stem cells induced by Bevacizumab. Oxymatrine enhanced the anti-tumor effects of Bevacizumab in vivo, and holded the potential of reducing the risk of relapse and metastasis by impairing the self-renewal ability of TNBC stem cells. The underlying mechanism was elucidated: Bevacizumab stimulated Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway, and Oxymatrine could compromise this effect. On this foundation, factoring into the satisfactory anti-angiogenic activity and low toxicity, Oxymatrine is a good candidate for the synergistic therapy together with Bevacizumab for the treatment of TNBC."

TNBC has attracted considerable attention due to its aggressiveness such as large tumor size, high proliferation rate, and metastasis. The absence of clinically efficient molecular targets is of great concern in treatment of patients with TNBC. In light of the complexity of TNBC, we applied a systematic and integrative transcriptomics and interactomics approach utilizing transcriptional regulatory and protein-protein interaction networks to discover putative transcriptional control mechanisms of TNBC. To this end, we identified TNBC-driven molecular pathways such as the Janus kinase-signal transducers, and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathways. The multi-omics molecular target and biomarker discovery approach presented here can offer ways forward on novel diagnostics and potentially help to design personalized therapeutics for TNBC in the future."

While reports on HuR overexpression contributing to chemoresistance exist, limited information is available on HuR and radioresistance especially in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In this study we investigated the role of HuR in radiation resistance in three TNBC (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and Hs578t) cell lines. Endogenous HuR expression was higher in TNBC cells compared to normal cells. siRNA mediated knockdown of HuR (siHuR) markedly reduced HuR mRNA and protein levels compared to scrambled siRNA (siScr) treatment. Further, siHuR treatment sensitized TNBC cells to ionizing radiation at 2 Gy compared to siScr treatment as evidenced by the significant reduction in clonogenic cell survival from 59%, 49%, and 65% in siScr-treated cells to 40%, 33%, and 46% in siHuR-treated MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and Hs578t cells, respectively. Molecular studies showed increased ROS production and inhibition of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) in HuR knockdown cells contributed to radiosensitization. Associated with increased ROS production was evidence of increased DNA damage, demonstrated by a significant increase (p < 0.05) in γ-H2AX foci that persisted for up to 24 h in siHuR plus radiation treated cells compared to control cells. Further, comet assay revealed that HuR-silenced cells had larger and longer-lasting tails than control cells, indicating higher levels of DNA damage. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that HuR knockdown in TNBC cells elicits oxidative stress and DNA damage resulting in radiosensitization."

Current treatment options for TNBC patients are restricted to chemotherapy; however tyrosine kinases are promising druggable targets due to their high expression in multiple TNBC subtypes. Since coexpression of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) can promote signaling crosstalk and cell survival in the presence of kinase inhibitors, it is likely that multiple RTKs will need to be inhibited to enhance therapeutic benefit and prevent resistance. The MET and EGFR receptors are actionable targets due to their high expression in TNBC; however crosstalk between MET and EGFR has been implicated in therapeutic resistance to single agent use of MET or EGFR inhibitors in several cancer types. Therefore it is likely that dual inhibition of MET and EGFR is required to prevent crosstalk signaling and acquired resistance. In this study, we evaluated the heterogeneity of MET and EGFR expression and activation in primary and metastatic TNBC tumorgrafts and determined the efficacy of MET (MGCD265 or crizotinib) and/or EGFR (erlotinib) inhibition against TNBC progression. Here we demonstrate that combined MET and EGFR inhibition with either MGCD265 and erlotinib treatment or crizotinib and erlotinib treatment were highly effective at abrogating tumor growth and significantly decreased the variability in treatment response compared to monotherapy. These results advance our understanding of the RTK signaling architecture in TNBC and demonstrate that combined MET and EGFR inhibition may be a promising therapeutic strategy for TNBC patients."

BPA treatment can increase protein and mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinase‐2 (MMP‐2) and MMP‐9, while had no effect on the expression of vimentin (Vim) and fibronectin (FN) in TNBC cells. The expression of G‐protein‐coupled receptor (GPER), which has been suggested to mediate rapid oestrogenic signals, was not varied in BPA‐treated MDA‐MB‐231 and BT‐549 cells. Its inhibitor G15 also had no effect on BPA‐induced MMPs expression and cell invasion. Interestingly, BPA treatment can significantly increase the mRNA and protein expressions of oestrogen‐related receptor γ (ERRγ), but not ERRα or ERRβ, in both MDA‐MB‐231 and BT‐549 cells. The knock‐down of ERRγ can markedly attenuate BPA‐induced expression of MMP‐2 and MMP‐9 in TNBC cells. BPA treatment can activate both ERK1/2 and Akt in TNBC cells. Both inhibitors of ERK1/2 (PD98059) and Akt (LY294002) can attenuate BPA‐induced ERRγ expression and cell invasion of MDA‐MB‐231 cells. Collectively, our data revealed that BPA can increase the expression of MMPs and in vitro motility of TNBC cells via ERRγ. Both activation of ERK1/2 and Akt participated in this process.

These changes were accompanied by reduced phosphorylation of CDK1 and retinoblastoma (Rb) protein and decreased protein levels of cyclin B1, cMYC and survivin. We further demonstrated that siRNA knockdown of CDK9, the kinase subunit of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), instead of CDK1 or CDK2, reduced the levels of cyclin B1 and MYC in TNBC cell lines.

MiR-18a is a miRNA that is aberrantly overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, its biophysical function in TNBC is still not clear. In this study, we investigated the association among miR-18a dysregulation, Dicer dysregulation and paclitaxel (PTX) resistance in TNBC cells.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
20 TNBC patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery were recruited. MiR-18a expression was quantified using QRT-PCR. The effects of miR-18a overexpression or knockdown on cell viability and apoptosis of PTX sensitive MDA-MB-231 cells and PTX resistant MDA-MB-231 cells after PTX treatment were studied. The influence of miR-18a overexpression on Dicer expression was measured by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis.


RESULTS
Tissues from patients with stable disease (SD, n = 5) and progressive disease (PD, n = 2) to paclitaxel (PTX) containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy had significantly higher miR-18a expression than that from patients with partial response (PR, n = 13). MDA-MB-231/PTX cells had higher miR-18a expression than MDA-MB-231 cells. MiR-18a overexpression directly led to Dicer repression at mRNA and protein level. MiR-18a overexpression significantly increased PTX IC50 and reduced PTX induced cell apoptosis, while miR-18a suppression substantially decreased PTX IC50 and increased PTX induced cell apoptosis.


CONCLUSIONS
This study found that miR-18a is an important miRNA that suppresses Dicer expression and increases PTX resistance in TNBC cells."

Despite initial good response to chemotherapy, 30% of the patients relapse within 5 years after treatment. EGFR overexpression is a common marker in TNBC, and its expression has been correlated with poor outcome. Inhibition of fatty acid synthase (FASN) activity leads to apoptosis of human carcinoma cells overexpressing FASN. We tested the hypothesis that blocking FASN in combination with anti-EGFR signaling agents would be an effective antitumor strategy in sensitive and chemoresistant TNBC. Experimental Design: Several TNBC cell lines and 29 primary tumors were included to determine whether FASN is a potential target in TNBC. Doxorubicin-resistant TNBC cell lines (231DXR and HCCDXR) have been developed and characterized in our laboratory. Cellular and molecular interactions of anti-FASN compounds (EGCG and C75) with cetuximab were analyzed. In vivo tumor growth inhibition was evaluated after cetuximab, EGCG, or the combination in TNBC orthoxenograft models. Results: TNBC cell lines showed overexpression of FASN enzyme and its inhibition correlated to FASN levels. FASN staining was observed in all of the 29 TNBC tumor samples. In vitro, EGCG and C75 plus cetuximab showed strong synergism in sensitive and chemoresistant cells. In vivo, the combination of EGCG with cetuximab displayed strong antitumor activity against the sensitive and chemoresistant TNBC orthoxenografts, without signs of toxicity. Conclusions: Our results show that the simultaneous blockade of FASN and EGFR is effective in preclinical models of sensitive and chemoresistant TNBC. Clin Cancer Res; 22(18); 4687–97. ©2016 AACR."

The development of effective treatment strategies therefore represents a pressing unmet clinical need. We previously identified a molecularly targeted approach to target aberrant epigenetics of TNBC using a peptide corresponding to the SIN3 interaction domain (SID) of MAD. SID peptide selectively blocked binding of SID-containing proteins to the paired α-helix (PAH2) domain of SIN3, resulting in epigenetic and transcriptional modulation of genes associated with epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). To find small molecule inhibitor (SMI) mimetics of SID peptide, we performed an in silico screen for PAH2 domain–binding compounds. This led to the identification of the avermectin macrocyclic lactone derivatives selamectin and ivermectin (Mectizan) as candidate compounds. Both selamectin and ivermectin phenocopied the effects of SID peptide to block SIN3–PAH2 interaction with MAD, induce expression of CDH1 and ESR1, and restore tamoxifen sensitivity in MDA-MB-231 human and MMTV-Myc mouse TNBC cells in vitro. Treatment with selamectin or ivermectin led to transcriptional modulation of genes associated with EMT and maintenance of a cancer stem cell phenotype in TNBC cells. This resulted in impairment of clonogenic self-renewal in vitro and inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Underlining the potential of avermectins in TNBC, pathway analysis revealed that selamectin also modulated the expression of therapeutically targetable genes. Consistent with this, an unbiased drug screen in TNBC cells identified selamectin-induced sensitization to a number of drugs, including those targeting modulated genes.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most severe sub-type of breast cancer, occurring in younger women and associated with poor prognosis even when treated at a localized stage. We investigated here the relationship between complete pathological response after chemotherapy and breast cancer stem-cell characteristics in pre-treatment biopsies of 78 women with triple negative breast carcinoma (TNBC). We found that chemoresistance was associated with large numbers of breast cancer stem-cells, and that these cancer stem-cells were neither proliferative nor apoptotic, but in an autophagic state related to hypoxia. Using relevant pharmacological models of patient-derived TNBC xenografts, we further investigated the role of autophagy in chemoresistance of breast cancer stem-cells. We demonstrated that hypoxia increased drug resistance of autophagic TNBC stem-cells, and showed that molecular or chemical inhibition of autophagic pathway was able to reverse chemoresistance. Our results support breast cancer stem-cell evaluation in pre-treatment biopsies of TNBC patients, and the need for further research on autophagy inhibition to reverse resistance to chemotherapy."

In the subset of TNBCs that express estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), ligand-mediated activation of ERβ elicits potent anticancer effects. We report here the elucidation of the ERβ cistrome and transcriptome in TNBC and identify a mechanism whereby ERβ induces cystatin gene expression resulting in inhibition of canonical TGFβ signaling and a blockade of metastatic phenotypes. These findings suggest that ERβ-targeted therapies represent a treatment option for the subset of women with ERβ-expressing TNBC. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for a disproportionately high number of deaths due to a lack of targeted therapies and an increased likelihood of distant recurrence. Estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), a well-characterized tumor suppressor, is expressed in 30% of TNBCs, and its expression is associated with improved patient outcomes. We demonstrate that therapeutic activation of ERβ elicits potent anticancer effects in TNBC through the induction of a family of secreted proteins known as the cystatins, which function to inhibit canonical TGFβ signaling and suppress metastatic phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo. These data reveal the involvement of cystatins in suppressing breast cancer progression and highlight the value of ERβ-targeted therapies for the treatment of TNBC patients."

Genomic profiling studies highlighted the high level of heterogeneity of this cancer, which comprises different subtypes with unique phenotypes and response to treatment. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) is an established mesenchymal/stem cell-specific marker in human glioblastoma and, as recently suggested, it may uniquely mark breast cancer cells with stem-like characteristics and/or that have undergone epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Methods: Immunohistochemical analysis for PDGFRβ expression was performed on a human TNBC tissue microarray. Functional assays were conducted on mesenchymal-like TNBC cells to investigate the effect of a previously validated PDGFRβ aptamer on invasive cell growth in three-dimensional culture conditions, migration, invasion and tube formation. The aptamer was labeled with a near-infrared (NIR) dye and its binding specificity to PDGFRβ was assessed both in vitro (confocal microscopy and flow cytometry analyses) and in vivo (fluorescence molecular tomography in mice bearing TNBC xenografts). A mouse model of TNBC lung metastases formation was established and NIR-labeled PDGFRβ aptamer was used to detect lung metastases in mice untreated or intravenously injected with unlabeled aptamer. Results: Here, we present novel data showing that tumor cell expression of PDGFRβ identifies a subgroup of mesenchymal tumors with invasive and stem-like phenotype, and propose a previously unappreciated role for PDGFRβ in driving TNBC cell invasiveness and metastases formation. We show that the PDGFRβ aptamer blocked invasive growth and migration/invasion of mesenchymal TNBC cell lines and prevented TNBC lung metastases formation. Further, upon NIR-labeling, the aptamer specifically bound to TNBC xenografts and detected lung metastases. Conclusions: We propose PDGFRβ as a reliable biomarker of a subgroup of mesenchymal TNBCs with invasive and stem-like phenotype as well as the use of the PDGFRβ aptamer as a high efficacious tool for imaging and suppression of TNBC lung metastases. This study will allow for the significant expansion of the current repertoire of strategies for managing patients with more aggressive TNBC."

Using in vivo mouse models for BCM in brain, we observed that TNBC cells crossed the blood–brain barrier (BBB), lodged in the brain microvasculature and remained adjacent to brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). Breaching of the BBB in vivo by TNBCs resulted in increased BBB permeability and changes in ZO‐1 and claudin‐5 tight junction (TJ) protein structures. Angiopoietin‐2 expression was elevated in BMECs and was correlated with BBB disruption. Secreted Ang‐2 impaired TJ structures and increased BBB permeability. Treatment of mice with the neutralizing Ang‐2 peptibody trebananib prevented changes in the BBB integrity and BMEC destabilization, resulting in inhibition of TNBC colonization in brain. Thus, Ang‐2 is involved in initial steps of brain metastasis cascade, and inhibitors for Ang‐2 may serve as potential therapeutics for brain metastasis.

Although initially responsive to chemotherapy, most recurrent TNBCs develop resistance, resulting in disease progression. Autophagy is a lysosome-mediated degradation and recycling process that can function as an adaptive survival response during chemotherapy and contribute to chemoresistance. Our goal was to determine whether autophagy inhibition improves treatment efficacy in TNBC cells in tumors either sensitive or refractory to anthracyclines. Experimental Design: We used in vitro and in vivo models of TNBC using cell lines sensitive to epirubicin and other anthracyclines, as well as derivative lines, resistant to the same drugs. We assessed basal autophagy levels and the effects of chemotherapy on autophagy in parental and resistant cells. Applying various approaches to inhibit autophagy alone and in combination with chemotherapy, we assessed the effects on cell viability in vitro and tumor growth rates in vivo. Results: We demonstrated that epirubicin induced autophagic flux in TNBC cells. Epirubicin-resistant lines exhibited at least 1.5-fold increased basal autophagy levels and, when treated with autophagy inhibitors, showed a significant loss in viability, indicating dependence of resistant cells on autophagy for survival. Combination of epirubicin with the autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine resulted in a significant reduction in tumor growth compared with monotherapy with epirubicin. Conclusion: Autophagy inhibition enhances therapeutic response in both anthracycline-sensitive and -resistant TNBC and may be an effective new treatment strategy for this disease.

Using in vivo mouse models for BCM in brain, we observed that TNBC cells crossed the blood–brain barrier (BBB), lodged in the brain microvasculature and remained adjacent to brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). Breaching of the BBB in vivo by TNBCs resulted in increased BBB permeability and changes in ZO‐1 and claudin‐5 tight junction (TJ) protein structures. Angiopoietin‐2 expression was elevated in BMECs and was correlated with BBB disruption. Secreted Ang‐2 impaired TJ structures and increased BBB permeability. Treatment of mice with the neutralizing Ang‐2 peptibody trebananib prevented changes in the BBB integrity and BMEC destabilization, resulting in inhibition of TNBC colonization in brain. Thus, Ang‐2 is involved in initial steps of brain metastasis cascade, and inhibitors for Ang‐2 may serve as potential therapeutics for brain metastasis.

Although initially responsive to chemotherapy, most recurrent TNBCs develop resistance, resulting in disease progression. Autophagy is a lysosome-mediated degradation and recycling process that can function as an adaptive survival response during chemotherapy and contribute to chemoresistance. Our goal was to determine whether autophagy inhibition improves treatment efficacy in TNBC cells in tumors either sensitive or refractory to anthracyclines. Experimental Design: We used in vitro and in vivo models of TNBC using cell lines sensitive to epirubicin and other anthracyclines, as well as derivative lines, resistant to the same drugs. We assessed basal autophagy levels and the effects of chemotherapy on autophagy in parental and resistant cells. Applying various approaches to inhibit autophagy alone and in combination with chemotherapy, we assessed the effects on cell viability in vitro and tumor growth rates in vivo. Results: We demonstrated that epirubicin induced autophagic flux in TNBC cells. Epirubicin-resistant lines exhibited at least 1.5-fold increased basal autophagy levels and, when treated with autophagy inhibitors, showed a significant loss in viability, indicating dependence of resistant cells on autophagy for survival. Combination of epirubicin with the autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine resulted in a significant reduction in tumor growth compared with monotherapy with epirubicin. Conclusion: Autophagy inhibition enhances therapeutic response in both anthracycline-sensitive and -resistant TNBC and may be an effective new treatment strategy for this disease.

Previous studies have shown that AR is widely expressed in up to one-third of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the role of AR in TNBC is still not fully understood, especially in mesenchymal stem-like (MSL) TNBC cells. Methods: MSL TNBC MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T breast cancer cells were exposed to various concentration of agonist 5-α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or nonsteroidal antagonist bicalutamide or untreated. The effects of AR on cell viability and apoptosis were determined by MTT assay, cell counting, flow cytometry analysis and protein expression of p53, p73, p21 and Cyclin D1 were analyzed by western blotting. The bindings of AR to p73 and p21 promoter were detected by ChIP assay. MDA-MB-231 cells were transplanted into nude mice and the tumor growth curves were determined and expression of AR, p73 and p21 were detected by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining after treatment of DHT or bicalutamide. Results: We demonstrate that AR agonist DHT induces MSL TNBC breast cancer cells proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in vitro. Similarly, activated AR significantly increases viability of MDA-MB-231 xenografts in vivo. On the contrary, AR antagonist, bicalutamide, causes apoptosis and exerts inhibitory effects on the growth of breast cancer. Moreover, DHT-dependent activation of AR involves regulation in the cell cycle related genes, including p73, p21 and Cyclin D1. Further investigations indicate the modulation of AR on p73 and p21 mediated by direct binding of AR to their promoters, and DHT could make these binding more effectively. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the tumorigenesis role of AR and the inhibitory effect of bicalutamide in AR-positive MSL TNBC both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that AR inhibition could be a potential therapeutic approach for AR-positive TNBC patients."

Increasing evidence supports that autophagy was related to drug resistance at present. However, the role and the mechanism of autophagy to the treatment of TNBC remain unknown. In the current study, we investigated the effect of autophagy inhibitor to gefitinib (Ge) in TNBC cells in vitro and in nude mice vivo. Our study demonstrated that inhibition of autophagy by 3-Methyladenine or bafilomycin A1 improved Ge’s sensitivity to MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, as evidence from stronger inhibition of cell vitality and colony formation, higher level of G0/G1 arrest and DNA damage, and these effects were verified in nude mice vivo. Our data showed that the mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis pathway was activated in favor of promoting apoptosis in the therapy of Ge combined autophagy inhibitor, as the elevation of BAX/Bcl-2, Cytochrome C, and CASP3. These results demonstrated that targeting autophagy should be considered as an effective therapeutic strategy to enhance the sensitivity of EGFR inhibitors on TNBC."

However, a great understanding of features of TNBC particularly associated with BRCA mutations has led to the development of different therapeutic approaches. Besides, identification of TNBC subtypes contribute to investigation of the underlying molecular differences and development of new strategies for the treatment of TNBC patients. In this review, we discussed the definition and characteristic properties of TNBC. We summarized an up‐to‐date description of the reported clinical trials of novel targeted strategies especially PARP inhibitors (PARPi) due to novel and highly potent for the treatment of TNBC. Additionally, we reviewed published studies which investigated the prevalence and types of BRCA1/2 mutation in breast cancer patients to assess and draw attention of association of BRCA status with TNBC. Consequently, the definition subtype of TNBC has important predictive value for the development of new therapeutic agents in the treatment of TNBC. Additionally, the incidence and types of mutations in BRCA‐related pathways may be affected by ethnic origin and contribute to the risk of developing TNBC."

TNBC frequently harbors BRCA mutations translating to platinum sensitivity potentially augmented by additional suppression of DNA repair mechanisms through PARP inhibition. We evaluated brain penetrance and efficacy of carboplatin ± the PARP inhibitor ABT888, and investigated gene-expression changes in murine intracranial TNBC models stratified by BRCA and molecular subtype status. Athymic mice were inoculated intracerebrally with BRCA-mutant: SUM149 (basal), MDA-MB-436 (claudin-low); or BRCA–wild-type (wt): MDA-MB-468 (basal), MDA-MB-231BR (claudin-low). TNBC cells were treated with PBS control [intraperitoneal (IP), weekly], carboplatin (50 mg/kg/wk, IP), ABT888 (25 mg/kg/d, oral gavage), or their combination. DNA damage (γ-H2AX), apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3, cC3), and gene expression were measured in intracranial tumors. Carboplatin ± ABT888 significantly improved survival in BRCA-mutant intracranial models compared with control, but did not improve survival in BRCA-wt intracranial models. Carboplatin + ABT888 revealed a modest survival advantage versus carboplatin in BRCA-mutant models. ABT888 yielded a marginal survival benefit in the MDA-MB-436, but not in the SUM149 model. BRCA-mutant SUM149 expression of γ-H2AX and cC3 proteins was elevated in all treatment groups compared with control, whereas BRCA-wt MDA-MB-468 cC3 expression did not increase with treatment. Carboplatin treatment induced common gene-expression changes in BRCA-mutant models. Carboplatin ± ABT888 penetrates the brain and improves survival in BRCA-mutant intracranial TNBC models with corresponding DNA damage and gene-expression changes.

The aim of our study was to investigate the functional role of microRNA‐135b (miR‐135b) in TNBC. A real‐time polymerase chain reaction assay was used to quantify miR‐135b expression levels in 90 paired TNBC tissue and adjacent normal tissue samples. Wound‐healing and transwell assays were performed to evaluate the effects of miR‐135b expression on the migration and invasion of TNBC cells. Luciferase reporter and western blot analyses were used to verify whether the mRNA encoding APC is a major target of miR‐135b. In the current study, we found that miR‐135b was highly expressed in TNBC tissue and cells, and the expression levels were correlated with lymph node status and TNM stage. In TNBC cells, the ectopic expression of miR‐135b promoted cell proliferation and invasion in vitro. In addition, our study proved that the overexpression of miR‐135b significantly suppressed APC expression by targeting the 3′‐untranslated region of APC, whereas enhanced APC expression could partially abrogate the miR‐135b‐mediated promotion of carcinogenic traits in TNBC cells. Taken together, our study demonstrated that miR‐135b expression promoted the proliferation and invasion of TNBC by downregulating APC expression, indicating that miR‐135b may serve as a promising target for the treatment of TNBC patients."

By chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays, we found that HOXC8 functioned as a transcription factor to activate the transcription of matrix Gla protein (MGP) gene, leading to an increase in the proliferation, anchorage‐independent growth, and migration of TNBC cells. We further demonstrated that MGP expression promoted the epithelial‐mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of TNBC cells, but not the other subtypes of breast cancer, suggesting that MGP induced EMT to promote proliferation and migration of TNBC cells. Moreover, we found that MGP was upregulated in clinical breast specimens compared to normal breast tissues and high MGP expression was statistically associated with poor, relapse‐free survival for TNBC patients, indicating that MGP is probably a novel biomarker or therapeutic target for TNBC patients. Together, our results showed that the HOXC8‐MGP axis played an important role in the tumorigenesis of TNBC and might be a promising therapeutic target for TNBC treatment."

Proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα can facilitate tumor progression and metastasis. However, the mechanistic aspects of inflammation mediated TNBC progression remain unclear. Using ChIP-seq, we demonstrate that the cistrome for the AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun is comprised of 13,800 binding regions in TNFα-stimulated TNBC cells. In addition, we show that c-Jun regulates nearly a third of the TNFα-regulated transcriptome. Interestingly, high expression level of the c-Jun-regulated pro-invasion gene program is associated with poor clinical outcome in TNBCs. We further demonstrate that c-Jun drives TNFα-mediated increase of malignant characteristics of TNBC cells by transcriptional regulation of Ninj1. As exemplified by the CXC chemokine genes clustered on chromosome 4, we demonstrate that NF-κB might be a pioneer factor required for the regulation of TNFα-inducible inflammatory genes, whereas c-Jun has little effect.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous group of tumors for some of which the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway may play an important role. We investigated the efficacy and toxicity of an anti-EGFR antibody (panitumumab) combined with a standard neoadjuvant anthracycline-taxane-based chemotherapy in patients with operable, stage II-III, TNBC.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Treatment in this multicentric neoadjuvant pilot study consisted of panitumumab (9 mg/kg) for eight cycles q.3 weeks combined with four cycles of 5-fluorouracil, epidoxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC100: 500/100/500 mg/m(2)) q.3 weeks, followed by four cycles of docetaxel (T: 100 mg/m(2)) q.3 weeks. Following therapy, all patients underwent surgical resection. Pathologic complete response (pCR) in assessable patients was the main end point while clinical response, toxicity and ancillary studies were secondary end points. Paraffin-embedded and frozen tumor samples were systematically collected with the aim to identify predictive biomarkers of efficacy and resistance in order to select biologically defined subpopulations for potential further clinical development of the anti-EGFR antibody.


RESULTS
Sixty patients were included with 47 assessable for pathologic response. The pCR rates were 46.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 32.5% to 61.1%] and 55.3% [95% CI: 41.1% to 69.5%] according, respectively, to Chevallier and Sataloff classifications. The complete clinical response (cCR) rate was 37.5%. Conservative surgery was carried out in 87% of cases. Toxicity was manageable. The association of high EGFR and low cytokeratin 8/18 expression in tumor cells on one hand and high density of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes on the other hand were significantly predictive of pCR.


CONCLUSIONS
Panitumumab in combination with FEC100 followed by docetaxel appears efficacious, with acceptable toxicity, as neoadjuvant therapy of operable TNBC. Several biomarkers could help define large subsets of patients with a high probability of pCR, suggesting a potential interest to further develop this combination in biologically defined subgroups of patients with TNBC.

However, ever-mounting research demonstrates striking differences between cell lines and clinical TNBC tumors, disconnecting bench research and actual clinical responses. In this review, we discuss the limitations of cell lines and the importance of using patients’ tumors for translational research, and highlight the usage of patient-derived xenograft (PDXs) models that have emerged as a clinically relevant platform for preclinical studies. PDX tumors possess tumor heterogeneity with similar cellular, molecular, genetic and epigenetic properties akin to those found within patients’ tumors. Moreover, PDX and clinical tumors possess abnormal vasculature with higher blood vessel permeability, a feature that is not always demonstrated in in vivo cell line xenografts. Development of clinically relevant, novel drug-nanoparticles capable of accumulating in PDX tumors through the enhanced permeability and retention effect in tumor vasculature may lead to new and effective TNBC treatments."

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with limited treatment options and poor prognosis. TNBC is usually diagnosed at a relatively young age and is characterized by high risk of developing metastases. Some epigenetic regulation of gene expression is associated with TNBC. Expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) can serve as a potential tool for identifying critical biomarkers in TNBC. The aim of our study is to examine expression of selected miRNAs in TNBC and to assess the relationship between miRNA expression and clinicopathological factors.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Expression levels of 19 selected miRNAs were compared between cancerous and normal breast tissues by use of qPCR method. We have evaluated the relationship between the expression level of miRNAs and clinicopathological factors such as: age, tumor size and lymph node status.


RESULTS
We found that in TNBC tissues, when compared with normal breast tissues, the expression of miR-190a, miR- 136-5p and miR-126-5p was significantly reduced (p = 0.0041, p = 0.0007, p = 0.0007, respectively) whereas expression of miR-135b-5p and miR-182-5p was significantly increased (p = 0.0194, p = 0.0041, respectively). We found a linear trend for tumor size and expression of miR-126-5p (p = 0.0296) and miR-135b-5p (p = 0.0241).


CONCLUSIONS
Our study confirms that miRNA expression profile is dysregulated in TNBC patients compared to healthy controls. MiR-190a, miR-136-5p, miR-126-5p, miR-135b-5p and miR-182-5p may be associated with development and progression of TNBC."

Evidence from experimental and clinical studies indicates that progesterone is a risk factor for breast cancer under certain conditions through binding nuclear progesterone receptor (PR). These mechanisms, however, are not applicable to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) due to the lack of PR in these cancers. In this study, we demonstrate that membrane progesterone receptor α (mPRα) is expressed in TNBC tissues and the expression level of mPRα is negatively associated with the TNM stage. We found that progesterone suppressed the growth, migration and invasion of mPRα+ human TNBC cells in vitro, which was neither mediated by PR nor by PR membrane component 1 (PGRMCl). Notably, these effects exerted by progesterone were significantly blocked by shRNA specific to mPRα. Moreover, the knockdown of mPRα expression impaired the inhibitory effects of progesterone on mPRα+ tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. These data collectively indicate that progesterone suppresses TNCB growth and metastasis via mPRα, which provides evidence of the anti-neoplastic effects of progesterone-mPRα pathway in the treatment of human TNBC."

Aggressive, triple‐negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are enriched for tumour‐initiating cells (TICs). We investigated that hypothesis that VEGF receptors expressed on TNBC cells mediate autocrine signalling that contributes to tumour initiation. We discovered the VEGF receptor neuropilin‐2 (NRP2) is expressed preferentially on TICs, involved in the genesis of TNBCs and necessary for tumour initiation. The mechanism by which NRP2 signalling promotes tumour initiation involves stimulation of the α6β1 integrin, focal adhesion kinase‐mediated activation of Ras/MEK signalling and consequent expression of the Hedgehog effector GLI1. GLI1 also induces BMI‐1, a key stem cell factor, and it enhances NRP2 expression and the function of α6β1, establishing an autocrine loop. NRP2 can be targeted in vivo to retard tumour initiation. These findings reveal a novel autocrine pathway involving VEGF/NRP2, α6β1 and GLI1 that contributes to the initiation of TNBC. They also support the feasibility of NRP2‐based therapy for the treatment of TNBC that targets and impedes the function of TICs."

Finding effective targets for chemotherapy-resistant TNBC has proven difficult in part because of TNBC's molecular heterogeneity. We have previously reported that likely because of the antiapoptotic activity of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast epithelial and cancer cells, high GR expression/activity in early-stage TNBC significantly correlates with chemotherapy resistance and increased recurrence. We hypothesized that pretreatment with mifepristone, a GR antagonist, would potentiate the efficacy of chemotherapy in GR+ TNBCs by inhibiting the antiapoptotic signaling pathways of GR and increasing the cytotoxic efficiency of chemotherapy. Experimental Design: TNBC cell apoptosis was examined in the context of physiologic glucocorticoid concentrations, chemotherapy, and/or pharmacologic concentrations of mifepristone. We used high-throughput live microscopy with continuous recording to measure apoptotic cells stained with a fluorescent dye and Western blot analysis to detect caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. The effect of mifepristone on GR-mediated gene expression was also measured. TNBC xenograft studies were performed in female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice and tumors were measured following treatment with vehicle, paclitaxel, or mifepristone/paclitaxel. Results: We found that although mifepristone treatment alone had no significant effect on TNBC cell viability or clonogenicity in the absence of chemotherapy, the addition of mifepristone to dexamethasone/paclitaxel treatment significantly increased cytotoxicity and caspase-3/PARP cleavage. Mifepristone also antagonized GR-induced SGK1 and MKP1/DUSP1 gene expression while significantly augmenting paclitaxel-induced GR+ MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumor shrinkage in vivo. Conclusions: These results suggest that mifepristone pretreatment could be a useful strategy for increasing tumor cell apoptosis in chemotherapy-resistant GR+ TNBC.

Here we report that protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6) is expressed in approximately 70% of TNBCs where it acts to promote survival and metastatic lung colonization. PTK6 downregulation in mesenchymal TNBC cells suppressed migration and three-dimensional culture growth, and enhanced anoikis, resistance to which is considered a prerequisite for metastasis. PTK6 downregulation restored E-cadherin levels via proteasome-dependent degradation of the E-cadherin repressor SNAIL. Beyond being functionally required in TNBC cells, kinase-active PTK6 also suppressed E-cadherin expression, promoted cell migration, and increased levels of mesenchymal markers in nontransformed MCF10A breast epithelial cells, consistent with a role in promoting an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). SNAIL downregulation and E-cadherin upregulation mediated by PTK6 inhibition induced anoikis, leading to impaired metastatic lung colonization in vivo Finally, effects of PTK6 downregulation were phenocopied by treatment with a recently developed PTK6 kinase inhibitor, further implicating kinase activity in regulation of EMT and metastases. Our findings illustrate the clinical potential for PTK6 inhibition to improve treatment of patients with high-risk TNBC. Cancer Res; 76(15); 4406-17. ©2016 AACR."

Therefore, our aim was to investigate the targeting of AR as a possible hormonal approach to the treatment of TNBC. Analysis of 2091 patients revealed an association between AR expression and poor overall survival, selectively in patients with the basal subtype of breast cancer, the vast majority of which are TNBC. IC50 values for the second-generation anti-androgen enzalutamide across 11 breast cancer cell lines varied from 4 µM to >50 µM. The activity of enzalutamide was similar in TN and non-TN cell lines but was dependent on the presence of AR. Enzalutamide reduced clonogenic potential and cell growth in a 3D matrix in AR-positive cells. In addition, enzalutamide also inhibited cell migration and invasion in an AR-dependent manner. Enzalutamide appeared to mediate these processes through down-regulation of the transcription factors AP-1 and SP-1. The first-generation anti-androgen flutamide similarly blocked cell growth, migration and invasion. AR-positive TNBC cells clustered separately from AR-negative cells based on an androgen-related gene expression signature, independently of TNBC subtype. We conclude that targeting of the AR with drugs such as enzalutamide may provide an alternative treatment strategy for patients with AR-positive TNBC."

It shows high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. At this juncture, because of the lack of specific targeted therapies available and the development in patients of resistance to some therapeutic agents, clinical and translational settings have gained importance over the past decades. Areas covered: The development of novel, safe and effective alternatives for the treatment of TNBC are in high demand. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the state of the art of TNBC, its current therapies and potential therapeutic targets. In particular, focus is put on recent advances regarding the identification of emerging biomarkers as prognostic and/or predictive markers, including surrogate markers for molecular tumor subtyping and identifying potential responders to new therapies. Expert opinion: Effective development of informative markers could constitute an important armamentarium tool for identifying appropriate therapies to challenge the aggressiveness of TNBC."
Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) promotes the epithelial mesenchymal transition of triple negative breast cancer cells via HDAC8/FOXA1 signals,"[{'authorId': '48915277', 'name': 'Shao-yu Wu'}, {'authorId': '47874709', 'name': 'Zhi-Qiang Luo'}, {'authorId': '15568870', 'name': 'Pengjiu Yu'}, {'authorId': '15249953', 'name': 'Hui-Juan Xie'}, {'authorId': '2145029305', 'name': 'Yuwen He'}]",47,2016,62b824a71517a3a403a2f7b476f91bb512d27a57,"Abstract Inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACIs) have great therapeutic value for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Interestingly, our present study reveals that suberoyl anilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), one of the most advanced pan-HDAC inhibitor, can obviously promote in vitro motility of MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells via induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). SAHA treatment significantly down-regulates the expression of epithelial markers E-cadherin (E-Cad) while up-regulates the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin (N-Cad), vimentin (Vim) and fibronectin (FN). However, SAHA has no effect on the expression and nuclear translocation of EMT related transcription factors including Snail, Slug, Twist and ZEB. While SAHA treatment down-regulates the protein and mRNA expression of FOXA1 and then decreases its nuclear translocation. Over-expression of FOXA1 markedly attenuates SAHA induced EMT of TNBC cells. Further, silence of HDAC8, while not HDAC6, alleviates the down-regulation of FOXA1 and up-regulation of N-Cad and Vim in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with SAHA. Collectively, our present study reveals that SAHA can promote EMT of TNBC cells via HDAC8/FOXA1 signals, which suggests that more attention should be paid when SAHA is used as anti-cancer agent for cancer treatment."

Hence, TNBC patients cannot benefit from clinically available targeted therapies and rely on chemotherapy and surgery for treatment. While initially responding to chemotherapy, TNBC patients are at increased risk of developing distant metastasis and have decreased overall survival compared with non-TNBC patients. A majority of TNBC tumors carry p53 mutations, enabling them to bypass the G1 checkpoint and complete the cell cycle even in the presence of DNA damage. Therefore, we hypothesized that TNBC cells are sensitive to cell-cycle–targeted combination therapy, which leaves nontransformed cells unharmed. Our findings demonstrate that sequential administration of the pan-CDK inhibitor roscovitine before doxorubicin treatment is synthetically lethal explicitly in TNBC cells. Roscovitine treatment arrests TNBC cells in the G2–M cell-cycle phase, priming them for DNA damage. Combination treatment increased frequency of DNA double-strand breaks, while simultaneously reducing recruitment of homologous recombination proteins compared with doxorubicin treatment alone. Furthermore, this combination therapy significantly reduced tumor volume and increased overall survival compared with single drug or concomitant treatment in xenograft studies. Examination of isogenic immortalized human mammary epithelial cells and isogenic tumor cell lines found that abolishment of the p53 pathway is required for combination-induced cytotoxicity, making p53 a putative predictor of response to therapy. By exploiting the specific biologic and molecular characteristics of TNBC tumors, this innovative therapy can greatly impact the treatment and care of TNBC patients.

Since there are no positive markers to reliably classify TNBC, these tumours are not yet treated with targeted therapies. Perhaps for this reason they are the most aggressive form of breast carcinomas. However, the clinical observation that these patients do not carry a uniformly dismal prognosis, coupled with data coming from pathology and epidemiology, suggests that this negative definition is not capturing a single clinical entity, but several. We critically evaluate this evidence in this paper, reviewing clinical and epidemiological data and new studies that aim to subclassify TNBC. Moreover, evidence on the role of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) on TNBC progression, response to chemotherapy and patient outcome have been published. The heterogeneity, observed even at TILs level, highlights the idea that TNBC is much more than a single disease with a unique treatment. The exploration of the immune environment present at the tumour site could indeed help in answering the question ‘How many diseases is TNBC’ and will help to define prognosis and eventually develop new therapies, by stimulating the immune effector cells or by inhibiting immunological repressor molecules. In this review, we focus on the prospect of the patient’s diverse immune signatures within the tumour as potential biomarkers and how they could be modulated to fight the disease."

In the multivariate analysis, MBC (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.09, P < 0.001), presence of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) (HR: 12.8, P = 0.05), and metastasis development at any time during the clinical course (HR: 38.7, P < 0.001) were significant factors that decreased PFS, whereas metastasis development was the only independent prognostic factor of OS (HR: 23.8, P = 0.009).MBC is significantly correlated with worse PFS and OS compared with TNBC. Patients with MBC are resistant to conventional CT agents, and more efficient treatment regimens are required."

In this study, we developed a hyaluronic acid (HA)-decorated polyethylenimine-poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PEI-PLGA) nanoparticle (NP) system for targeted co-delivery of TRAIL plasmid (pTRAIL) and gambogic acid (GA) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) therapy. GA was encapsulated into the core of the PEI-PLGA NPs while pTRAIL was adsorbed onto the positive NP surface via charge adsorption. The coating of HA on PEI-PLGA NPs functions as a targeting ligand by binding to CD44 receptor of TNBC cells and a shell to neutralize the excess positive charge of inner NPs. The resultant pTRAIL and GA co-loaded HA-coated PEI-PLGA NPs exhibited spherical shape (121.5 nm) and could promote the internalization of loaded cargoes into TNBC cells through the CD44-dependent endocytic pathway. The dual drug-loaded NPs significantly augmented apoptotic cell death in vitro and inhibited TNBC tumor growth in vivo. This multifunctional NP system efficiently co-delivered GA and pTRAIL, thus representing a promising strategy to treat TNBC and bringing forth a platform strategy for co-delivery of therapeutic DNA and chemotherapeutic agents in combinatorial TNBC therapy."

In current study, we found that triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, compared to T47D, an ERα+ breast cancer cell line, exhibited 7~40 times lower IC50 values, stronger cell cycle perturbation, increased cell apoptosis and stronger inhibition of cell migration upon 17-DMAG treatment, while T47D, compared to TNBC cells, expressed higher HDAC6 and showed stronger anti-cancer response upon treatment of Tubacin. Mechanically, 17-DMAG treatment inhibited a complex network consists at least ERK, AKT, and Hippo pathway in TNBC cells, and higher expression of HDAC6 inhibited HSP90 activity via deacetylating HSP90. Furthermore, we found higher HDAC6 expression level in tamoxifen-resistance T47D than that in T47D, and Tubacin treatment suppressed the growth of tamoxifen-resistant cells in vivo. Our data suggested that anti-HSP90 and anti-HDAC6 are promising strategies to treat TNBC and ERα+ breast cancers respectively, and anti-HDAC6 can be considered during treatment of tamoxifen-resistance breast cancers."

Cancer cells induce activation of normal fibroblasts to carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which promote survival, proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance of cancer cells. A better understanding of these interactions could lead to new, targeted therapies for cancers with limited treatment options, such as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). To overcome limitations of standard monolayer cell cultures and xenograft models that lack tumor complexity and/or human stroma, we have developed a high throughput tumor spheroid technology utilizing a polymeric aqueous two-phase system to conveniently model interactions of CAFs and TNBC cells and quantify effects on signaling and drug resistance of cancer cells. We focused on signaling by chemokine CXCL12, a hallmark molecule secreted by CAFs, and receptor CXCR4, a driver of tumor progression and metastasis in TNBC. Using three-dimensional stromal-TNBC cells cultures, we demonstrate that CXCL12 – CXCR4 signaling significantly increases growth of TNBC cells and drug resistance through activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Despite resistance to standard chemotherapy, upregulation of MAPK and PI3K signaling sensitizes TNBC cells in co-culture spheroids to specific inhibitors of these kinase pathways. Furthermore, disrupting CXCL12 – CXCR4 signaling diminishes drug resistance of TNBC cells in co-culture spheroid models.

It has been well documented that inflammatory mediators from tumor microenvironment are involved in the pathogenesis of TNBC and might be related to chemoresistance of cancer cells. In this study, the contribution of interleukin‐6 (IL‐6), one of the principal oncogenic molecules, in chemoresistance of a TNBC cell line MDA‐MB‐231 was first investigated. The results showed that IL‐6 treatment could induce upregulation of HIF‐1α via the activation of STAT3 in MDA‐MB‐231 cells, which consequently contributed to its effect against chemotherapeutic drug‐induced cytotoxicity and cell apoptosis. However, knockdown of HIF‐1α attenuated such effect via affecting the expressions of apoptosis‐related molecules as Bax and Bcl‐2 and drug transporters as P‐gp and MRP1. This study indicated that targeting at IL‐6/HIF‐1α signaling pathway might be an effective strategy to overcome chemoresistance in TNBC therapy."

However, few cases undergo FISH in China, leading to difficulty regarding subsequent treatment decisions. Here, we used immunohistochemical analysis to explore expression of fascin‐1, an actin‐bundling protein, as a diagnostic marker of TNBC. A total of 457 cases of breast cancer were divided into four molecular subtypes, including 82 cases (17.9%) of TNBC, 81 (17.7%) of HER2‐enriched, 185 (40.5%) of luminal A, and 109 (23.9%) of luminal B. Positive fascin‐1 expression was seen in 144 cases (31.5%), including 77 (16.8%) strong positive cases. Rates of positive and strong positive expression of fascin‐1 were significantly higher in cases of TNBC than in the other molecular subtypes. In all cases of breast cancer, the sensitivities and specificities of positive and strong positive fascin‐1 expression for predicting TNBC were 87.8% and 80.8%, and 78.0% and 96.5%, respectively. In cases of hormone receptor–negative breast cancer, the sensitivities and specificities of positive and strong positive fascin‐1 expression for predicting TNBC were 87.8% and 61.7%, and 78.0% and 92.6%, respectively. In 24 cases with estrogen receptor (ER)‐, PR‐, and HER2 2 + equivocal status who underwent FISH, the sensitivity and specificity of strong positive fascin‐1 expression for predicting TNBC were 71.4% and 90.0%. These results suggest that strong positive fascin‐1 expression can be used as a diagnostic marker of TNBC."

To discover potential therapeutic targets for the poor prognosis-associated triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), gene expression profiling was carried out on a cohort of 130 breast cancer samples. Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) was found to be significantly overexpressed in TNBC compared with the other breast cancer subtypes. High PLK1 expression was confirmed by reverse phase protein and tissue microarrays. In triple-negative cell lines, RNAi-mediated PLK1 depletion or inhibition of PLK1 activity with a small molecule (BI-2536) induced an increase in phosphorylated H2AX, G(2)-M arrest, and apoptosis. A soft-agar colony assay showed that PLK1 silencing impaired clonogenic potential of TNBC cell lines. When cells were grown in extracellular matrix gels (Matrigel), and exposed to BI-2536, apoptosis was observed specifically in TNBC cancerous cells, and not in a normal cell line. When administrated as a single agent, the PLK1 inhibitor significantly impaired tumor growth in vivo in two xenografts models established from biopsies of patients with TNBC. Most importantly, the administration of BI-2536, in combination with doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide chemotherapy, led to a faster complete response compared with the chemotherapy treatment alone and prevented relapse, which is the major risk associated with TNBC. Altogether, our observations suggest PLK1 inhibition as an attractive therapeutic approach, in association with conventional chemotherapy, for the management of patients with TNBC."

Off-target effects and poor bioavailability of the FDA-approved antiobesity drug orlistat hinder its clinical translation as a repurposed new drug against TNBC. Here, we demonstrate a newly engineered drug formulation for packaging orlistat tailored to TNBC treatment. We synthesized TNBC-specific folate receptor–targeted micellar nanoparticles (NP) carrying orlistat, which improved the solubility (70–80 μg/mL) of this water-insoluble drug. The targeted NPs also improved the delivery and bioavailability of orlistat to MDA-MB-231 cells in culture and to tumor xenografts in a nude mouse model. We prepared HEA–EHA copolymer micellar NPs by copolymerization of 2-hydroxyethylacrylate (HEA) and 2-ethylhexylacrylate (EHA), and functionalized them with folic acid and an imaging dye. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of TNBC cells indicated a dose-dependent increase in apoptotic populations in cells treated with free orlistat, orlistat NPs, and folate-receptor–targeted Fol-HEA-EHA-orlistat NPs in which Fol-HEA-EHA-orlistat NPs showed significantly higher cytotoxicity than free orlistat. In vitro analysis data demonstrated significant apoptosis at nanomolar concentrations in cells activated through caspase-3 and PARP inhibition. In vivo analysis demonstrated significant antitumor effects in living mice after targeted treatment of tumors, and confirmed by fluorescence imaging. Moreover, folate receptor–targeted Fol-DyLight747-orlistat NP–treated mice exhibited significantly higher reduction in tumor volume compared to control group. Taken together, these results indicate that orlistat packaged in HEA-b-EHA micellar NPs is a highly promising new drug formulation for TNBC therapy. Mol Cancer Ther; 15(2); 221–31. ©2015 AACR."

Multifunctional nanoparticles with the abilities of targeted drug delivery and noninvasive imaging for monitoring drug delivery and responses to therapy, such as theranostic nanoparticles, hold great promise toward the development of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of TNBC using a single therapeutic platform. The biological and pathological characteristics of TNBC provide insight into several potential molecular targets for current and future nanoparticle-based therapeutics. Extensive tumor stroma, highly proliferative cells, and a high rate of drug resistance are all barriers that must be appropriately addressed in order for these nanotherapeutic platforms to be effective. Utilization of the enhanced permeability and retention effect coupled with active targeting of cell surface receptors expressed by TNBC cells, and tumor-associated endothelial cells, stromal fibroblasts, and macrophages is likely to overcome such barriers to facilitate more effective drug delivery. An in-depth summary of current studies investigating targeted nanoparticles in preclinical TNBC mouse and human xenograft models is presented. This review aims to outline the current status of nanotherapeutic options for TNBC patients, identification of promising molecular targets, challenges associated with the development of targeted nanotherapeutics, the research done by our group as well as by others, and future perspectives on the nanomedicine field and ways to translate current preclinical studies into the clinic."

TNBC exhibits a more aggressive phenotype and a poorer clinical outcome compared to other breast cancer subgroups, accounting for 15-20% of total breast cancer cases. To date, the treatment strategies for TNBC are limited to surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, owing to the lack of effective therapeutic targets. Therefore, it is important to identify specific targets for TNBCs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a family of small non-coding RNAs regulating gene expression, are an emerging class of regulators of various biological processes, including cell proliferation, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and drug resistance. Actually, miRNAs may serve as a novel therapeutic target in TNBC, and here we review current correlated researches and provide our own profiling results for the miRNAs expressed in TNBC cell lines.

There is an urgent need to identify and understand the key factors and signalling pathways driving TNBC tumour progression, relapse, and treatment resistance. In this study, we report that gene copy numbers and expression levels of nuclear factor IB (NFIB), a recently identified oncogene in small cell lung cancer, are preferentially increased in TNBC compared to other breast cancer subtypes. Furthermore, increased levels of NFIB are significantly associated with high tumour grade, poor prognosis, and reduced chemotherapy response. Concurrent TP53 mutations and NFIB overexpression (z‐scores > 0) were observed in 77.9% of TNBCs, in contrast to 28.5% in non‐TNBCs. Depletion of NFIB in TP53‐mutated TNBC cell lines promotes cell death, cell cycle arrest, and enhances sensitivity to docetaxel, a first‐line chemotherapeutic drug in breast cancer treatment. Importantly, these alterations in growth properties were accompanied by induction of CDKN1A, the gene encoding p21, a downstream effector of p53. We show that NFIB directly interacts with the CDKN1A promoter in TNBC cells. Furthermore, knockdown of combined p21 and NFIB reverses the docetaxel‐induced cell growth inhibition observed upon NFIB knockdown, indicating that NFIB's effect on chemotherapeutic drug response is mediated through p21. Our results indicate that NFIB is an important TNBC factor that drives tumour cell growth and drug resistance, leading to poor clinical outcomes. Thus, targeting NFIB in TP53‐mutated TNBC may reverse oncogenic properties associated with mutant p53 by restoring p21 activity. Copyright © 2018 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

CSCs are thought to be responsible for tumor initiation and drug resistance. cAMP-response element-binding (CREB) binding protein (CREBBP or CBP) has been implicated in CSC biology and may provide a novel therapeutic target in TNBC. Methods: RNA Seq pre- and post treatment with the CBP-binding small molecule ICG-001 was used to characterize CBP-driven gene expression in TNBC cells. In vitro and in vivo TNBC models were used to determine the therapeutic effect of CBP inhibition via ICG-001. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were used to investigate the potential of CBP and associated proteins as biomarkers in TNBC. Results: The CBP/ß-catenin/FOXM1 transcriptional complex drives gene expression in TNBC and is associated with increased CSC numbers, drug resistance and poor survival outcome. Targeting of CBP/β-catenin/FOXM1 with ICG-001 eliminated CSCs and sensitized TNBC tumors to chemotherapy. Immunohistochemistry of TMAs demonstrated a significant correlation between FOXM1 expression and TNBC subtype. Conclusion: CBP/β-catenin/FOXM1 transcriptional activity plays an important role in TNBC drug resistance and CSC phenotype. CBP/β-catenin/FOXM1 provides a molecular target for precision therapy in triple negative breast cancer and could form a rationale for potential clinical trials."

Lacking effective therapeutic options hinders treatment of TNBC. Here, we show that bepridil (BPD) and trifluoperazine (TFP), which are FDA-approved drugs for treatment of schizophrenia and angina respectively, inhibit Akt-pS473 phosphorylation and promote FOXO3 nuclear localization and activation in TNBC cells. BPD and TFP inhibit survival and proliferation in TNBC cells and suppress the growth of TNBC tumors, whereas silencing FOXO3 reduces the BPD- and TFP-mediated suppression of survival in TNBC cells. While BPD and TFP decrease the expression of oncogenic c-Myc, KLF5, and dopamine receptor DRD2 in TNBC cells, silencing FOXO3 diminishes BPD- and TFP-mediated repression of the expression of these proteins in TNBC cells. Since c-Myc, KLF5, and DRD2 have been suggested to increase cancer stem cell-like populations in various tumors, reducing these proteins in response to BPD and TFP suggests a novel FOXO3-dependent mechanism underlying BPD- and TFP-induced apoptosis in TNBC cells."

Studies were conducted in the presence and absence of paclitaxel (Taxol). TNBC cell lines had higher levels of amino acids, branched-chain amino acids, nucleotides, and nucleotide sugars and lower levels of proliferation-related metabolites like choline compared with Luminal A cell lines. In the presence of paclitaxel, each cell line showed unique metabolic responses, with some similarities by type. For example, in the Luminal A cell lines, levels of lactate and creatine decreased while certain choline metabolites and myo-inositol increased with paclitaxel. In the TNBC cell lines levels of glutamine, glutamate, and glutathione increased, whereas lysine, proline, and valine decreased in the presence of drug. Profiling secreted inflammatory cytokines in the conditioned media demonstrated a greater response to paclitaxel in the hormone-positive Luminal cells compared with a secretion profile that suggested greater drug resistance in the TNBC cells. The most significant differences distinguishing the cell types based on pathway enrichment analyses were related to amino acid, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism pathways, whereas several biological pathways were differentiated between the cell lines following treatment."

Due to these specific characteristics, chemotherapy does not usually yield substantial improvements and new target therapies and alternative strategies are needed. The beneficial responses of TNBC survivors to regular exercise, including a reduction in the rate of tumor growth, are becoming increasingly apparent. Physiological adaptations to exercise occur in skeletal muscle but have an impact on the entire body through systemic control of energy homeostasis and metabolism, which in turn influence the TNBC tumor microenvironment. Gaining insights into the causal mechanisms of the therapeutic cancer control properties of regular exercise is important to improve the prescription and implementation of exercise and training in TNBC survivors. Here, we provide new evidence of the effects of exercise on TNBC prevention, control, and outcomes, based on the inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB also known as Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (PI3K-Akt-mTOR) signaling. These findings have wide-ranging clinical implications for cancer treatment, including recurrence and case management."

Although this does not seem different at the present time, yet the last few years have witnessed many breakthrough genomic and molecular findings, that could dramatically improve our understanding of the biological complexity of TNBC. Based on genomic analyses, it was consistently evident that TNBC comprises a heterogeneous group of cancers, which have numerous diverse molecular aberrations. This—in return—has provided a platform for a new generation of clinical trials using many innovative therapies, directed against such novel targets. At the present time, two PARP inhibitors and one anti‐PD‐L1 monoclonal antibody (in combination with chemotherapy) have been approved in certain subpopulations of metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) patients, which have finally brought this disease into the era of personalized medicine. In the current review, we will explore the genomic landscape of TNBC, through which many actionable targets were graduated. We will also discuss the results of the key—practice changing—clinical studies, and some upcoming personalized treatment options for patients with mTNBC, that may be clinically adopted in the near future."

Our data showed that YAP1 expression was associated with early relapse in tissue samples of patients with TNBC taxol chemoresistance (P < .001). Verteporfin reduced migration and enhanced apoptosis or autophagy of a taxol‐resistant MDA‐MB‐231 cell line in vitro. Knockdown of YAP1 increased epithelial‐mesenchymal transition response in a taxol‐resistant TNBC cell line. In an in vivo experiment, we found that verteporfin was able to shrink tumor weight and volume and decreased Ki67 expression in a taxol‐resistant mouse model. Our results provide evidence that verteporfin could be a chemosensitizer for TNBC patients with taxol‐based treatment."

Here, we show that mammary‐specific deletion of Pten via WAP‐Cre, which targets alveolar progenitors, induced tumors with shortened latency compared to those induced by MMTV‐Cre, which targets basal/luminal progenitors. Combined Pten‐p53 mutations accelerated formation of claudin‐low, triple‐negative‐like breast cancer (TNBC) that exhibited hyper‐activated AKT signaling and more mesenchymal features relative to Pten or p53 single‐mutant tumors. Twenty‐four genes that were significantly and differentially expressed between WAP‐Cre:Pten/p53 and MMTV‐Cre:Pten/p53 tumors predicted poor survival for claudin‐low patients. Kinome screens identified eukaryotic elongation factor‐2 kinase (eEF2K) inhibitors as more potent than PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors on both mouse and human Pten/p53‐deficient TNBC cells. Sensitivity to eEF2K inhibition correlated with AKT pathway activity. eEF2K monotherapy suppressed growth of Pten/p53‐deficient TNBC xenografts in vivo and cooperated with doxorubicin to efficiently kill tumor cells in vitro. Our results identify a prognostic signature for claudin‐low patients and provide a rationale for using eEF2K inhibitors for treatment of TNBC with elevated AKT signaling."

Most TNBC has a basal-like molecular phenotype by gene expression profiling and shares clinical and pathological features with hereditary BRCA1 related breast cancers. This review evaluates the activity of available chemotherapy and targeted agents in TNBC. A systematic review of PubMed and conference databases was carried out to identify randomised clinical trials reporting outcomes in women with TNBC treated with chemotherapy and targeted agents. Our review identified TNBC studies of chemotherapy and targeted agents with different mechanisms of action, including induction of synthetic lethality and inhibition of angiogenesis, growth and survival pathways. TNBC is sensitive to taxanes and anthracyclins. Platinum agents are effective in TNBC patients with BRCA1 mutation, either alone or in combination with poly adenosine diphosphate polymerase 1 inhibitors. Combinations of ixabepilone and capecitabine have added to progression-free survival (PFS) without survival benefit in metastatic TNBC. Antiangiogenic agents, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and EGFR inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy produced only modest gains in PFS and had little impact on survival. TNBC subgroups respond differentially to specific targeted agents. In future, the treatment needs to be tailored for a specific patient, depending on the molecular characteristics of their malignancy. TNBC being a chemosensitive entity, combination with targeted agents have not produced substantial improvements in outcomes. Appropriate patient selection with rationale combinations of targeted agents is needed for success."

When Treatment Promotes Metastasis In cancer, therapy aims to kill the primary tumor and prevent metastasis. Truong et al. found that although strategies blocking β1 integrin are effective at treating primary breast tumors, they may cause metastatic disease in certain patients. In E-cadherin–positive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines, blocking β1 integrin function by gene silencing or with antibodies induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)–associated signaling and the loss of E-cadherin, enabling TNBC cells to migrate individually and invade a three-dimensional collagen matrix in culture. When injected into zebrafish, the β1 integrin–deficient cells disseminated further than the parent TNBC cells. When implanted in mice, these cells formed more lung metastases, despite producing smaller primary tumors compared with those produced by implanted parent cells. Thus, therapies targeted against β1 integrin may not be suitable for some TNBC patients. Interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) through integrin adhesion receptors provide cancer cells with physical and chemical cues that act together with growth factors to support survival and proliferation. Antagonists that target integrins containing the β1 subunit inhibit tumor growth and sensitize cells to irradiation or cytotoxic chemotherapy in preclinical breast cancer models and are under clinical investigation. We found that the loss of β1 integrins attenuated breast tumor growth but markedly enhanced tumor cell dissemination to the lungs. When cultured in three-dimensional ECM scaffolds, antibodies that blocked β1 integrin function or knockdown of β1 switched the migratory behavior of human and mouse E-cadherin–positive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells from collective to single cell movement. This switch involved activation of the transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ) signaling network that led to a shift in the balance between miR-200 microRNAs and the transcription factor zinc finger E-box–binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2), resulting in suppressed transcription of the gene encoding E-cadherin. Reducing the abundance of a TGFβ receptor, restoring the ZEB/miR-200 balance, or increasing the abundance of E-cadherin reestablished cohesion in β1 integrin–deficient cells and reduced dissemination to the lungs without affecting growth of the primary tumor. These findings reveal that β1 integrins control a signaling network that promotes an epithelial phenotype and suppresses dissemination and indicate that targeting β1 integrins may have undesirable effects in TNBC."

We herein reported that ionizing radiation (IR) induced Wnt3a, LRP6 and β-catenin expression and consequently activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in TNBC MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and Hs578T cells. Moreover, depletion of β-catenin by shRNA sensitized TNBC cells to IR, whereas treatment of Wnt3a protein or overexpression of β-catenin resulted in radioresistance of TNBC cells. Niclosamide, a potent inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, not only inhibited constitutive Wnt/β-catenin signaling, but also blocked IR-induced Wnt/β-catenin signaling in TNBC cells. In addition, niclosamide sensitized TNBC cells to IR, prevented Wnt3a-induced radioresistance, and overcame β-catenin-induced radioresistance in TNBC cells. Importantly, animals treated with the combination of niclosamide and γ-ray local tumor irradiation had significant inhibition of MDA-MB-231 tumor growth compared with treated with local tumor irradiation alone. These findings indicate that Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays an important role in the development of radioresistance of TNBC cells, and that niclosamide had significant radiosensitizing effects by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling in TNBC cells. Our study also provides rationale for further preclinical and clinical evaluation of niclosamide in TNBC management."

Our study reveals that expression of estrogen related receptor α (ERRα) is significantly (p < 0.01) positively associated with high grade tumors and lymph node metastasis, while negatively correlated with overall survival (OS), in 138 TNBC patients. Targeted inhibition of ERRα by its inverse agonist XCT-790 or si-RNA obviously inhibits in vitro motility of TNBC cells. While over expression of ERRα triggers the invasion and migration of TNBC cells. Further, si-ERRα and XCT-790 inhibit the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of TNBC cells with increasing the expression of E-cadherin and decreasing fibronectin (FN) and vimentin. While XCT-790 has no effect on the expression of EMT related transcription factors such as Snail or Slug. Further, inhibitors of MAPK, PI3K/Akt, NF-κB signal molecules, which are activated by XCT-790, can not attenuate the suppression effects of XCT-790 on EMT. Alternatively, luciferase reporter gene assays and ChIP analysis indicate that ERRα can directly bind with FN promoter at ERR response element-3 (ERRE-1), ERRE-3, and ERRE-4, while XCT-790 reduces this bond. In vivo data show that ERRα expression is significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with FN in clinical TNBC patients. In MDA-MB-231 tumor xenograft models, XCT-790 decreases the expression of FN, inhibits the growth and lung metastasis, and suppresses the EMT. Our results demonstrate that ERRα functions as a metastasis stimulator and its targeted inhibition may be a new therapeutic strategy for TNBC treatment."

The FA-GNR@Pt hybrid nanoparticles are designed to integrate the photothermal conversion property of GNRs, the superior biocompatibility of polypeptide poly(l-glutamic acid) (PGA), the chemotoxicity of cisplatin, and the tumor targeting ability of FA into one single nanoplatform. In combination with localized near infrared (NIR) laser illumination, the resulting FA-GNR@Pt hybrid nanoparticles are able to significantly inhibit the growth of the TNBC tumor when administered systemically. In particular, they can extensively suppress the dissemination of TNBC cells from the primary tumor to the lung by eliminating the peripheral tumor blood vessels. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that the combined PT therapy and chemotherapy using cisplatin-loaded GNRs with FA conjugation might imply a promising strategy for targeted treatment of TNBC."

Thirty percent of patients recur after first-line treatment, and metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) has a poor prognosis with median survival of one year. Here, we present initial analyses of whole genome and transcriptome sequencing data from 14 prospective mTNBC. We have cataloged the collection of somatic genomic alterations in these advanced tumors, particularly those that may inform targeted therapies. Genes mutated in multiple tumors included TP53, LRP1B, HERC1, CDH5, RB1, and NF1. Notable genes involved in focal structural events were CTNNA1, PTEN, FBXW7, BRCA2, WT1, FGFR1, KRAS, HRAS, ARAF, BRAF, and PGCP. Homozygous deletion of CTNNA1 was detected in 2 of 6 African Americans. RNA sequencing revealed consistent overexpression of the FOXM1 gene when tumor gene expression was compared with nonmalignant breast samples. Using an outlier analysis of gene expression comparing one cancer with all the others, we detected expression patterns unique to each patient's tumor. Integrative DNA/RNA analysis provided evidence for deregulation of mutated genes, including the monoallelic expression of TP53 mutations. Finally, molecular alterations in several cancers supported targeted therapeutic intervention on clinical trials with known inhibitors, particularly for alterations in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. In conclusion, whole genome and transcriptome profiling of mTNBC have provided insights into somatic events occurring in this difficult to treat cancer.

The multi-compartment protein p32 is overexpressed and present at cell surfaces in a variety of tumors, including TNBC, specifically in the malignant cells and endothelial cells, and in macrophages localized in hypoxic areas of the tumor. Herein we used polyethylene glycol-polycaprolactone polymersomes that were affinity targeted with the p32-binding tumor penetrating peptide LinTT1 (AKRGARSTA) for imaging of TNBC lesions. A tyrosine residue was added to the peptide to allow for 124I labeling and PET imaging. In a TNBC model in mice, systemic LinTT1-targeted polymersomes accumulated in early tumor lesions more than twice as efficiently as untargeted polymersomes with up to 20% ID/cc at 24 h after administration. The PET-imaging was very sensitive, allowing detection of tumors as small as ∼20 mm3. Confocal imaging of tumor tissue sections revealed a high degree of vascular exit and stromal penetration of LinTT1-targeted polymersomes and co-localization with tumor-associated macrophages. Our studies show that systemic LinTT1-targeted polymersomes can be potentially used for precision-guided tumor imaging and treatment of TNBC."

The aim was to identify a group of serological biomarkers and to identify possible candidates for targeted therapy in patients with TNBC and non-TNBC. Protein levels of TGF-β1, IGF-I/IGF-IR and VEGF-A in the serum were measured in 43 TNBC, 53 non-TNBC and 20 normal control participants using quantitative ELISA assays. Results were correlated against standard prognostic factors, response to treatment and survival. TNBC was identified to be associated with poor prognosis and serum levels of VEGF-A and IGF/IGF-IR were significantly higher in the TNBC group compared with the non-TNBC group. IGF-IR and VEGF-A overexpression was observed to be correlated with TGF-β1 expression and all of the markers investigated were associated with metastasis and disease progression. In the multivariate analysis, VEGF-A, IGF-I and IGF-IR were observed to be independent predictors for overall survival, whereas TGF-β1 and lymph node status were identified as independent predictors for disease-free survival. The overall response rate was significantly lower in patients with TNBC and those with high levels of TGF-β1, IGF-I/IGF-IR and VEGF-A. In view of the present results, it was concluded that TGF-β1, IGF-I/IGF-IR and VEGF-A overexpression is associated with the presence of aggressive tumors, which exhibit an increased probability of metastasis, a poor response to treatment and reduced survival rate. This indicates that VEGF-A, IGF-IR and IGF-I have the potential to be used as surrogate biomarkers and are promising candidates for targeted therapy, particularly in patients with TNBC."

Dex functions by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to prevent allergic reactions and severe chemotherapeutic side effects such as nausea and vomiting. However, the mechanisms by which Dex causes chemoresistance remain unknown. Methods We used docetaxel and cisplatin to treat triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells with or without Dex and assessed cell proliferation using a sulforhodamine B colorimetric (SRB) assay. Additionally, Western blotting was employed to measure Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), GR and several apoptosis-related proteins. To determine how the GR regulates KLF5, we used qRT-PCR, luciferase reporter assays and ChIP assays. Finally, we detected the involvement of Dex in TNBC chemotherapeutic resistance using HCC1806 xenograft model in vivo. Results In this study, we demonstrated that Dex induces docetaxel and cisplatin resistance in TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo. Dex up-regulates pro-survival transcription factor KLF5 expression at both mRNA and protein levels dependent on GR. Importantly, Dex failed to promote cancer cell survival and tumor growth when KLF5 induction was blocked. Conclusions We conclude that KLF5 is a Dex-induced gene that contributes to Dex-mediated drug chemoresistance, providing a potential novel target for TNBC treatment."

No targeted therapy is currently available for the treatment of patients with TNBC. In order to discover potential therapeutic targets, we searched for protein kinases that are overexpressed in human TNBC biopsies and whose silencing in TNBC cell lines causes cell death. A cohort including human BC biopsies obtained at Institut Curie as well as normal tissues has been analyzed at a gene-expression level. The data revealed that the human protein kinase monopolar spindle 1 (hMPS1), also known as TTK and involved in mitotic checkpoint, is specifically overexpressed in TNBC, compared to the other BC subgroups and healthy tissues. We confirmed by immunohistochemistry and reverse phase protein array that TNBC expressed higher levels of TTK protein compared to the other BC subgroups. We then determined the biological effects of TTK depletion by RNA interference, through analyses of tumorigenic capacity and cell viability in different human TNBC cell lines. We found that RNAi-mediated depletion of TTK in various TNBC cell lines severely compromised their viability and their ability to form colonies in an anchorage-independent manner. Moreover, we observed that TTK silencing led to an increase in H2AX phosphorylation, activation of caspases 3/7, sub-G1 cell population accumulation and high annexin V staining, as well as to a decrease in G1 phase cell population and an increased aneuploidy. Altogether, these data indicate that TTK depletion in TNBC cells induces apoptosis. These results point out TTK as a protein kinase overexpressed in TNBC that may represent an attractive therapeutic target specifically for this poor prognosis associated subgroup of breast cancer."

Through its lack of expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), this subtype remains unresponsive to traditional targeted therapies. Undesirable and sometimes life-threatening side effects associated with current chemotherapeutic agents warrant the development of more targeted treatment options. Targeting signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a transcription factor implicated in breast cancer (BCa) progression, has proven to be an efficient approach to halt cancer growth in vitro and in vivo. Currently, there are no FDA-approved STAT3 inhibitors for TNBC. Although pimozide, a FDA-approved antipsychotic drug, has been attributed a role as a STAT3 inhibitor in several cancers, its role on this pathway remains unexplored in TNBC. As a “one size fits all” approach cannot be applied to TNBC therapies due to the heterogeneous nature of this aggressive cancer, we hypothesized that STAT3 could be a novel biomarker of response to guide pimozide therapy. Using human cell lines representative of four TNBC subtypes (basal-like 1, basal-like 2, mesenchymal-like, mesenchymal stem-like), our current report demonstrates that pimozide significantly reduced their invasion and migration, an effect that was predicted by STAT3 phosphorylation on tyrosine residue 705 (Tyr705). Mechanistically, phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr705) inhibition resulting from pimozide treatment caused a downregulation of downstream transcriptional targets such as matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and vimentin, both implicated in invasion and migration. The identification of biomarkers of response to TNBC treatments is an active area of research in the field of precision medicine and our results propose phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr705) as a novel biomarker to guide pimozide treatment as an inhibitor of invasion and migration."

Particularly breast cancers, which do not express estrogen receptor α (ERα) and progesterone receptor (PR) and which have no overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), so-called triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), are considered as very aggressive and have a poor prognosis. Recently we have shown that breast cancer cell invasion was dramatically increased when co-cultured with MG63 osteoblast-like cells. Using this model we have now analyzed whether estrogen receptor β (ERβ) plays a role in TNBC cell invasion in vitro. ERα and ERβ protein expression was analyzed using western blot analysis. Invasion was quantified by assessment of TNBC cell migration rate through an artificial basement membrane in a modified Boyden chamber during co-culture with MG63 osteoblast-like cells. The effects of ERβ agonist treatment on CXC motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) protein expression during co-culture with MG64 cells was quantified using western blot analysis. Proliferation was measured using alamarBlue assay. TNBC cell lines HCC1806 and HCC1937 showed no ERα but high ERβ protein expression. Cell invasion of HCC1806 and HCC1937 TNBC cells was significantly increased when co-cultured with MG63 osteoblast-like cells. Treatment with ERβ selective estrogen agonists liquiritigenin and ERB-041 reduced the ability to invade a reconstituted basement membrane and to migrate in response to the cellular stimulus. During co-culture CXCR4 protein expression of TNBC cell lines HCC1806 and HCC1937 was significantly increased. Treatment with liquiritigenin resulted in a significant decrease of CXCR4 protein expression. Both ERβ agonists showed no effect on TNBC cell proliferation. Our findings suggest that ERβ plays a major role in TNBC invasion. Bone-directed invasion can be inhibited by ERβ agonists."

Thus, there is an urgent clinical need to identify new therapeutic targets in order to improve the outlook for these patients. This review highlights the most promising therapeutic targets identified through new sequencing technologies, as well as through studies of apoptosis.

To identify shared and selective vulnerabilities of basal-like TNBC, the most common TNBC subtype, a directed siRNA lethality screen was performed in 7 human breast cancer cell lines, focusing on 154 previously identified dependency genes of 1 TNBC line. Thirty common dependency genes were identified, including multiple proteasome and RNA splicing genes, especially those associated with the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex (e.g., PRPF8, PRPF38A). PRPF8 or PRPF38A knockdown or the splicing modulator E7107 led to widespread intronic retention and altered splicing of transcripts involved in multiple basal-like TNBC dependencies, including protein homeostasis, mitosis, and apoptosis. E7107 treatment suppressed the growth of basal-A TNBC cell line and patient-derived basal-like TNBC xenografts at a well-tolerated dose. The antitumor response was enhanced by adding the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Thus, inhibiting both splicing and the proteasome might be an effective approach for treating basal-like TNBC.

Glycoprotein non-metastatic b (GPNMB) has recently been identified as a gene that is over-expressed in numerous cancers, including TNBC, and often correlates with the metastatic phenotype. In breast cancer, GPNMB expression in the tumor epithelium is associated with a reduction in disease-free and overall survival.

Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: Role of Specific Chemotherapy Agents,"[{'authorId': '4327978', 'name': 'S.

Many studies have shown significant benefit of chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and metastatic treatment of TNBC. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy studies have consistently reported higher response rates in TNBC than non-TNBC, and pathologic complete response has been shown to predict improved long-term outcomes for TNBC. Although the specific adjuvant regimens that may be most effective for TNBC are still being determined, third-generation chemotherapy regimens using dose dense or metronomic polychemotherapy are among the most effective tools presently available. The role of specific chemotherapy agents in the treatment of TNBC remains incompletely defined and warrants careful review to ensure that the most effective therapy is delivered while minimizing unnecessary toxicity. Platinum agents have seen renewed interest in TNBC based on a growing body of preclinical and clinical data suggesting encouraging activity. Taxanes and anthracyclines are active in TNBC and remain important agents but have not shown specific benefit over non-TNBC. Capecitabine has limited reported data in TNBC, but some reports suggest differential activity in TNBC compared with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. TNBC is itself a heterogeneous group in which subgroups such as BRCA1 mutation carriers may have particular sensitivity to platinum agents and relatively less sensitivity to taxanes. Therefore, the identification of additional molecular biomarkers to predict response to specific chemotherapy is required to further improve treatment strategies with the current menu of chemotherapy options and future combinations with targeted therapies."

Herein we compare TNBC and basal cytokeratin-positive breast cancers. We examine the different TNBC molecular subtypes, based on gene expression profiling, which include basal-like, mesenchymal, and luminal androgen receptors, in the context of their biology and impact on TNBC prognosis. We explore the potential role of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in TNBC tumor biology and treatment responses. iNOS has been shown to induce p53 mutation accumulation, basal-like gene signature enrichment, and transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) via S-nitrosylation, all of which are key components of TNBC biology. Moreover, iNOS predicts poor outcome in TNBC, and iNOS inhibitors show efficacy against TNBC when used in combination with chemotherapy. We discuss molecular targeted approaches, including EGFR, PARP, and VEGF inhibitors and immunotherapeutics, that are under consideration for the treatment of TNBC and what role, if any, iNOS may play in their success."

The microRNA-200 (miR-200) family is found to inhibit or promote breast cancer metastasis; however, the underlying mechanism is not well understood. This study was performed to investigate the effect and mechanism of miR-200b on TNBC metastasis and identify targets for developing more efficient treatment for TNBC. We found that miR-200 family expression levels are significantly lower in highly migratory TNBC cells and metastatic TNBC tumors than other types of breast cancer cells and tumors. Ectopically expressing a single member (miR-200b) of the miR-200 family drastically reduces TNBC cell migration and inhibits tumor metastasis in an orthotopic mouse mammary xenograft tumor model. We identified protein kinase Cα (PKCα) as a new direct target of miR-200b and found that PKCα protein levels are inversely correlated with miR-200b levels in 12 kinds of breast cancer cells. Inhibiting PKCα activity or knocking down PKCα levels significantly reduces TNBC cell migration. In contrast, forced expression of PKCα impairs the inhibitory effect of miR-200b on cell migration and tumor metastasis. Further mechanistic studies revealed that PKCα downregulation by miR-200b results in a significant decrease of Rac1 activation in TNBC cells. These results show that loss of miR-200b expression plays a crucial role in TNBC aggressiveness and that miR-200b suppresses TNBC cell migration and tumor metastasis by targeting PKCα. Our findings suggest that miR-200b and PKCα may serve as promising therapeutic targets for metastatic TNBC."

No proven targeted therapy is currently available for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently overexpressed in TNBC. We studied the activity of EGFR antagonists alone, and in combination with chemotherapy, in TNBC cell lines.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
EGFR and phosphorylated EGFR were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors alone and in combination with chemotherapy was assessed. Effects of gefitinib on EGFR signalling and cell cycle were also examined.


RESULTS
EGFR was overexpressed in the TNBC compared with the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)-positive cell lines. Phosphorylation of EGFR was detected in the TNBC cells in response to epidermal growth factor stimulation and was blocked by gefitinib treatment. However, the TNBC cell lines were less sensitive to EGFR inhibition than the HER-2-positive cell lines. Response to gefitinib was associated with reduced phosphorylation of both mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt and induction of G(1) arrest. Gefitinib enhanced response to both carboplatin and docetaxel in the TNBC cells, and the triple combination of gefitinib, carboplatin and docetaxel was synergistic.


CONCLUSIONS
Although the TNBC cells are less sensitive to EGFR inhibition than the HER-2-positive cell lines, gefitinib enhanced response to chemotherapy. Gefitinib combined with carboplatin and docetaxel warrants further investigation in TNBC."

We developed redox-responsive diselenide-based high-loading prodrug nanoparticles (NPs) for targeted triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) treatment. Method: Redox-responsive diselenide bond (Se-Se) containing dimeric prodrug (PTXD-Se) was synthesized and co-precipitated with TNBC-targeting amphiphilic copolymers to form ultra-stable NPs (uPA-PTXD NPs). The drug loading capacity and redox-responsive drug release behavior were studied. TNBC targeting effect and anti-tumor effect were also evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Results: On-demand designed paclitaxel dimeric prodrug could co-precipitate with amphiphilic copolymers to form ultra-stable uPA-PTXD NPs with high drug loading capacity. Diselenide bond (Se-Se) in uPA-PTXD NPs could be selectively cleaved by abnormally high reduced potential in tumor microenvironment, releasing prototype drug, thus contributing to improved anti-cancer efficacy. Endowed with TNBC-targeting ligand uPA peptide, uPA-PTXD NPs exhibited reduced systemic toxicity and enhanced drug accumulation in TNBC lesions, thus showed significant anti-tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion: The comprehensive advantage of high drug loading, redox-controlled drug release and targeted tumor accumulation suggests uPA-PTXD NPs as a highly promising strategy for effective TNBC treatment."

However, in highly aggressive metastatic triple‐negative breast cancers (TNBC) the role of β‐catenin and the underlying mechanism(s) for the aggressiveness of TNBC remain unknown. We illustrate that WNT10B induces transcriptionally active β‐catenin in human TNBC and predicts survival‐outcome of patients with both TNBC and basal‐like tumours. We provide evidence that transgenic murine Wnt10b‐driven tumours are devoid of ERα, PR and HER2 expression and can model human TNBC. Importantly, HMGA2 is specifically expressed during early stages of embryonic mammogenesis and absent when WNT10B expression is lost, suggesting a developmentally conserved mode of action. Mechanistically, ChIP analysis uncovered that WNT10B activates canonical β‐catenin signalling leading to up‐regulation of HMGA2. Treatment of mouse and human triple‐negative tumour cells with two Wnt/β‐catenin pathway modulators or siRNA to HMGA2 decreases HMGA2 levels and proliferation. We demonstrate that WNT10B has epistatic activity on HMGA2, which is necessary and sufficient for proliferation of TNBC cells. Furthermore, HMGA2 expression predicts relapse‐free‐survival and metastasis in TNBC patients."

Caloric restriction augments radiation efficacy in breast cancer,[],91,2013,bb62988c9b114ad9b23dd7f0abdfde00a4e0533a,"Dietary modification such as caloric restriction (CR) has been shown to decrease tumor initiation and progression. We sought to determine if nutrient restriction could be used as a novel therapeutic intervention to enhance cytotoxic therapies such as radiation (IR) and alter the molecular profile of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which displays a poor prognosis. In two murine models of TNBC, significant tumor regression is noted with IR or diet modification, and a greater regression is observed combining diet modification with IR. Two methods of diet modification were compared, and it was found that a daily 30% reduction in total calories provided more significant tumor regression than alternate day feeding. At the molecular level, tumors treated with CR and IR showed less proliferation and more apoptosis. cDNA array analysis demonstrated the IGF-1R pathway plays a key role in achieving this physiologic response, and multiple members of the IGF-1R pathway including IGF-1R, IRS, PIK3ca and mTOR were found to be downregulated. The innovative use of CR as a novel therapeutic option has the potential to change the biology of tumors and enhance the opportunity for clinical benefit in the treatment of patients with TNBC."

We evaluated the pathological complete response (pCR) rate after neoadjuvant epirubicin, (E) cyclophosphamide (C) and docetaxel containing chemotherapy with and without the addition of bevacizumab in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients with untreated cT1c-4d TNBC represented a stratified subset of the 1948 participants of the HER2-negative part of the GeparQuinto trial. Patients were randomized to receive four cycles EC (90/600 mg/m(2); q3w) followed by four cycles docetaxel (100 mg/m(2); q3w) each with or without bevacizumab (15 mg/kg; q3w) added to chemotherapy.


RESULTS
TNBC patients were randomized to chemotherapy without (n = 340) or with bevacizumab (n = 323). pCR (ypT0 ypN0, primary end point) rates were 27.9% without and 39.3% with bevacizumab (P = 0.003). According to other pCR definitions, the addition of bevacizumab increased the pCR rate from 30.9% to 41.8% (ypT0 ypN0/+; P = 0.004), 36.2% to 46.4% (ypT0/is ypN0/+; P = 0.009) and 32.9% to 43.3% (ypT0/is ypN0; P = 0.007). Bevacizumab treatment [OR 1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-2.42; P = 0.002], lower tumor stage (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.24-4.54; P = 0.009) and grade 3 tumors (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.14-2.48; P = 0.009) were confirmed as independent predictors of higher pCR in multivariate logistic regression analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy in TNBC significantly increases pCR rates."

Morphological and biological analyses can identify subtypes of TNBC, which can have different prognoses, and (in the case of the latter) may eventually be used to predict response to treatment. This mini-review focuses on clinically relevant issues in the diagnosis of TNBC, including the importance of adherence to international guidelines for the detection of ER/PR/HER2 status, and the relationship between TNBC and the overlapping (yet distinct) intrinsic subtype of 'basal-like' breast cancer. In addition, we review the potential use of emerging biomarkers as surrogates for molecular subtypes and as a means of identifying potential responders to new therapies."

Thus, these tumors are routinely treated with cytotoxic chemotherapies (e.g., anthracyclines), which can cause severe side effects that impact quality of life. Recent studies indicate that the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB) pathway is an important determinant in TNBC disease progression and therapeutic outcome. Furthermore, new therapeutic agents have been developed that specifically target the RB pathway, potentially positioning RB as a novel molecular marker for directing treatment. The current study evaluates the efficacy of pharmacological CDK4/6 inhibition in combination with the widely used genotoxic agent doxorubicin in the treatment of TNBC. Results demonstrate that in RB-proficient TNBC models, pharmacological CDK4/6 inhibition yields a cooperative cytostatic effect with doxorubicin but ultimately protects RB-proficient cells from doxorubicin-mediated cytotoxicity. In contrast, CDK4/6 inhibition does not alter the therapeutic response of RB-deficient TNBC cells to doxorubicin-mediated cytotoxicity, indicating that the effects of doxorubicin are indeed dependent on RB-mediated cell cycle control. Finally, the ability of CDK4/6 inhibition to protect TNBC cells from doxorubicin-mediated cytotoxicity resulted in recurrent populations of cells specifically in RB-proficient cell models, indicating that CDK4/6 inhibition can preserve cell viability in the presence of genotoxic agents. Combined, these studies suggest that while targeting the RB pathway represents a novel means of treatment in aggressive diseases such as TNBC, there should be a certain degree of caution when considering combination regimens of CDK4/6 inhibitors with genotoxic compounds that rely heavily on cell proliferation for their cytotoxic effects."

All these features will be discussed in this review. The risk of developing TNBC varies with age, race, genetics, breastfeeding patterns, and parity. Some TNBC are very chemo-sensitive and the majority of patients confronted with and treated for TNBC will never relapse. Some (histological) subgroups of TNBC may have good prognosis even in the absence of chemotherapy. Distinct molecular subgroups within TNBC have been defined now as well. In case metastatic relapse occurs, this is usually within 5 years following surgery, and survival following metastatic relapse is shorter compared to other breast cancer subtypes; treatment options are few and responses lack durability.

The tumor suppressor WWOX spans FRA16D, a common fragile site that is commonly altered in breast cancer. Despite recent progress, the role of WWOX in TNBC metastasis is unknown. Here we report that WWOX inactivation correlates with advanced stages of TNBC and that its levels are frequently altered in TNBC cells. Ectopic restoration of WWOX in WWOX-negative TNBC cells inhibited metastasis while its depletion in WWOX-positive TNBC cells promoted metastasis. WWOX was a negative regulator of c-MYC, which regulated miR-146a expression and consequently fibronectin levels, contributing to an epithelial status of the cell. Treatment of TNBC cells with anti-miR-146a rescued the WWOX antimetastatic phenotype. Moreover, overexpression of MYC in WWOX-expressing TNBC cells overrode WWOX effects on miR-146a and fibronectin levels. Altogether, our data uncover an essential role for WWOX in antagonizing TNBC progression and highlight its potential use as a biomarker for metastasis. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings highlight the mechanism by which the tumor suppressor WWOX regulates metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer.See related commentary by Sharma, p. 1746."

One of the tyrosine kinases, AXL, was found to be activated in a majority of aggressive TNBC cell lines and was accompanied by a higher level of AXL expression. High levels of AXL expression are correlated with a significant decrease in patient survival. Treatment of cells bearing activated AXL with a humanized AXL antibody inhibited cell proliferation and migration in vitro, and tumor growth in mice. Overall, our global phosphoproteomic analysis provided new insights into the heterogeneity in the activation status of tyrosine kinase pathways in TNBCs. Our approach presents an effective means of identifying important novel biomarkers and targets for therapy such as AXL in TNBC."

Historically, TNBC has been characterized by an aggressive natural history and worse disease-specific outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has allowed for the dissection of TNBC into molecular subtypes (i.e., basal-like, claudin-low). Within TNBC, several subtypes have emerged as ""immune-activated,"" consistently illustrating better disease outcome. In addition, NGS has revealed a host of molecular features characteristic of TNBC, including high rates of TP53 mutations, PI3K and MEK pathway activation, and genetic similarities to serous ovarian cancers, including inactivation of the BRCA pathway. Identified genetic vulnerabilities of TNBC have led to promising therapeutic approaches, including DNA-damaging agents (i.e., platinum salts and PARP inhibitors), as well as immunotherapy. Platinum salts are routinely incorporated into the treatment of metastatic TNBC; however, best outcomes are observed among those with deficiencies in the BRCA pathway. Although the incorporation of platinum in the neoadjuvant care of patients with TNBC yields higher pathologic complete response (pCR) rates, the impact on longer-term outcome is less clear. The presence of immune infiltrate in TNBC has shown both a predictive and prognostic role. Checkpoint inhibitors, including PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors, are under investigation in the setting of metastatic TNBC and have shown responses in initial clinical trials. Finally, matching emerging therapeutic strategies to optimal subtype of TNBC is of utmost importance as we design future research strategies to improve patient outcome."

Because of the absence of identified targets and targeted therapies, and due to a heterogeneous molecular presentation, treatment guidelines for patients with TNBC include only conventional chemotherapy. Such treatment, while effective for some, leaves others with high rates of early relapse and is not curative for any patient with metastatic disease. Here, we demonstrate that these tumors are sensitive to the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor PU-H71. Potent and durable anti-tumor effects in TNBC xenografts, including complete response and tumor regression, without toxicity to the host are achieved with this agent. Notably, TNBC tumors respond to retreatment with PU-H71 for several cycles extending for over 5 months without evidence of resistance or toxicity. Through a proteomics approach, we show that multiple oncoproteins involved in tumor proliferation, survival, and invasive potential are in complex with PU-H71-bound Hsp90 in TNBC. PU-H71 induces efficient and sustained downregulation and inactivation, both in vitro and in vivo, of these proteins. Among them, we identify downregulation of components of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway and G2-M phase to contribute to its anti-proliferative effect, degradation of activated Akt and Bcl-xL to induce apoptosis, and inhibition of activated NF-κB, Akt, ERK2, Tyk2, and PKC to reduce TNBC invasive potential. The results identify Hsp90 as a critical and multimodal target in this most difficult to treat breast cancer subtype and support the use of the Hsp90 inhibitor PU-H71 for clinical trials involving patients with TNBC."

However, its utility as a therapeutic target in this subtype of breast cancer is poorly understood. To evaluate MET fully as a potential therapeutic target for TNBC/BLBC, we investigated the relationship between MET expression and clinical outcomes of patients with breast cancer and the functional effect of MET inhibition. Using automated immunohistochemistry (Ventana), we analyzed MET expression in 924 breast cancer patients with relevant clinicopathologic parameters. BLBC showed the strongest relationship with MET expression (57.5%, p < 0.001). High expression of MET in breast cancer resulted in poor overall survival (p = 0.001) and disease‐free survival (DFS, p = 0.010). MET expression was relatively high in TNBC cell lines, and the silencing of MET via small interfering RNA reduced cell proliferation and migration. We observed reduced TNBC cell viability after treatment with the MET inhibitor PHA‐665752. In the most drug‐resistant cell line, MDA‐MB‐468, which showed elevated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression, silencing of EGFR resulted in increased sensitivity to PHA‐665752 treatment. We confirmed that PHA‐665752 synergizes with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib to decrease the viability of MDA‐MB‐468 cells. TNBC patients coexpressing MET and EGFR showed significantly worse DFS than that in patients expressing EGFR alone (p = 0.021). Our findings strongly suggest that MET may be a therapeutic target in TNBC and that the combined therapy targeting MET and EGFR may be beneficial for the treatment of TNBC/BLBC patients."

However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we showed that knockdown of LSD1 expression (LSD1-KD) by RNAi decreased mRNA levels of HDAC isozymes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of HDAC5 expression induced the most significant accumulation of H3K4me2, a specific substrate of LSD1. Combined treatment with LSD1 inhibitor, pargyline, and HDAC inhibitor, SAHA (Vorinostat), led to superior growth inhibition and apoptotic death in TNBC cells, but exhibited additive or antagonistic effect on growth inhibition in non-TNBC counterparts or non-tumorigenic breast cells. Additionally, LSD1-KD enhanced SAHA-induced reexpression of a subset of aberrantly silenced genes, such as NR4A1, PCDH1, RGS16, BIK, and E-cadherin whose reexpression may be tumor suppressive. Genome-wide microarray study in MDA-MB-231 cells identified a group of tumor suppressor genes whose expression was induced by SAHA and significantly enhanced by LSD1-KD. We also showed that concurrent depletion of RGS16 by siRNA reduced overall cytotoxicity of SAHA and blocked the reexpression of E-cadherin, CDKN1C and ING1 in LSD1-deficient MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, cotreatment with RGS16 siRNA reversed the downregulation of nuclear factor-kappaB expression induced by combined inhibition of LSD1 and HDACs, suggesting a crucial role of RGS16 in controlling key pathways of cell death in response to combination therapy. Taken together, these results provide novel mechanistic insight into the breast cancer subtype-dependent role of LSD1 in mediating HDAC activity and therapeutic efficacy of HDAC inhibitor."

Because TNBC commonly displays EGF receptor (EGFR) expression, and combinations of monoclonal antibodies to EGFR effectively inhibit other tumor models, we addressed the relevance of this strategy to treatment of TNBC. Unlike a combination of the clinically approved monoclonal antibodies, cetuximab and panitumumab, which displaced each other and displayed no cooperative effects, several other combinations resulted in enhanced inhibition of TNBC’s cell growth both in vitro and in animals. The ability of certain antibody mixtures to remove EGFR from the cell surface and to promote its intracellular degradation correlated with the inhibitory potential. However, unlike EGF-induced sorting of EGFR to lysosomal degradation, the antibody-induced pathway displayed independence from the intrinsic kinase activity and dimer formation ability of EGFR, and it largely avoided the recycling route. In conclusion, although TNBC clinical trials testing EGFR inhibitors reported lack of benefit, our results offer an alternative strategy that combines noncompetitive antibodies to achieve robust degradation of EGFR and tumor inhibition."

We found that TF is aberrantly present in large percentage of aggressive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PaC), two most lethal forms of malignancy that urgently need effective treatment. TF expression in TNBC clustered with higher levels of vimentin, basal-type keratins KRT5/14 and caveolin-1 but lower levels of luminal-type biomarkers. We developed a novel and specific anti-TF therapeutic antibody SC1, which displayed an exceedingly high potency against TF extracellular domain (EC50: 0.019 nM), TF-positive TNBC- or PaC cells (EC50: 2.5 nM), intracellular protease activated receptor 2 (PAR2) signaling (IC50: 2-3 nM) and tumor-initiated coagulation (IC50: <10 nM). Depletion of TF or SC1-treatment in TNBC or PaC cells inhibited TF-induced cell migration, lung metastasis and tumor growth in vivo, accompanied by diminished levels of tumor angiogenesis and stromal fibrosis. We further propose TF as a promising target for antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) development based on its rapid and efficient internalization of SC1-drug conjugate. Both SC1-DM1 and SC1-MMAE elicited exquisite cytotoxicity in TF-positive TNBC and PaC cells (IC50: 0.02-0.1 nM) but not in TF-negative cells (>100 nM) achieving >5000 fold target selectivity. Following a weekly intravenous administration, SC1-MMAE and its humanized hSC1-MMAE inhibited TNBC- and PaC tumor growth achieving MED of 0.3-1 mg/kg and were both well tolerated. Thus, the prevalent TF expression in TNBC and PaC renders these challenging tumors highly susceptible to TF-targeted treatment and may offer new opportunity in cancer patients."

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a recently identified biological variant with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis. Data of hormonal status from the Indian population is scarce due to financial constraints in performing immunohistochemistry evaluation. The present study aims to prospectively analyze receptor status of all breast cancer patients and identify TNBC and compare their clinical profile and short term survival with other non-TNBC group. Materials and methods All cytologically and histopathologically confirmed cases of carcinoma breast were prospectively enrolled. In a longitudinal study at tertiary care hospital in central India based on the hormonal status, they were further divided into TNBC and other groups. Comparison of risk factors, clinical profile and short-term survival was carried out. Results A total 85 patients were enrolled and of them 37 (43.7%) were TNBC. On comparing risk factors ie, age, age at menarche, total reproductive age, age at first child birth, and menopausal status – no statistical significance was observed between the TNBC and non-TNBC groups. But on comparison of clinical profile TNBC tumors were significantly large with majority of patients presenting as locally advanced breast cancer (83%). No statistical difference was observed in axillary lymph node status between two groups. TNBC tumors were histologically more aggressive (grade 3) compared to other groups. No statistically significant difference was observed in short term overall survival but all three deaths were observed in the TNBC group only and two local recurrences after surgery were observed in the TNBC group. Conclusion TNBC forms a large proportion of carcinoma breast patients in a central Indian scenario and needs more research to identify appropriate treatment planning considering aggressive histology and advanced presentation."

TGF-β-responsive gene signature is highly activated in chemotherapy-treated triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Here, we investigated the effect of zerumbone (ZER) on TGF-β1 signaling pathway and tumorigenecity of TNBC cells. Our results showed that the level of TGF-β1 mRNA expression and cell invasiveness were higher in TNBC cells than in non-TNBC cells. On the other hand, the cell motility of TNBC cells was completely suppressed by LY2109761, a novel selective TGF-β receptor type I/II (TβRI/II) dual inhibitor. In addition, FN and MMP-2 expression, which play an important role on cell motility in various cancer cells, were dose-dependently decreased by LY2109761. TGF-β1 increased FN, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in HCC1806 TNBC cells. TGF-β1-induced MMP-9 expression was decreased by both a MEK inhibitor, UO126, and a smad3 inhibitor, SIS3. Induction of FN and MMP-2 by TGF-β1 was just decreased by SIS3. Overexpression of smad3 significantly increased FN, MMP-2, and MMP-9 expression. Interestingly, ZER significantly suppressed TGF-β1-induced FN, MMP-2, and MMP-9 expression in HCC1806 cells. In addition, ZER completely decreased TGF-β1-induced the phosphorylation of smad3. Finally, we observed that ZER suppressed the tumorigenecity such as tumor volume, weight, Ki67 expression, and metastasis in TNBC cells xenograft models. Taken together, we demonstrated that ZER suppresses TGF-β1-induced FN, MMP-2, and MMP-9 expression through the inactivation of smad3 and inhibits the tumorigenecity of TNBC cells. Therefore, we suggest that ZER may act as a promising drug for treatment of TNBC."

Androgen receptor (AR) is one of newly emerging biomarker in TNBC. In recent years, ARs have been demonstrated to play an important role in the genesis and in the development of breast cancer, although their prognostic role is still debated. In the present study, we explored the correlation of AR expression with clinical, pathological and molecular features and its impact on prognosis in early TNBC. Patients and Methods: ARs were considered positive in case of tumors with >10% nuclear-stained. Survival distribution was estimated by the Kaplan Meier method. The univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. The difference among variables were calculated by chi-square test. Results: 81 TNBC patients diagnosed between January 2006 and December 2011 were included in the analysis. Slides were stained immunohistochemically for estrogen and progesterone receptors, HER-2, Ki-67, ALDH1, e-cadherin and AR. Of the 81 TNBC samples, 18.8% showed positive immunostaining for AR, 23.5% and 44.4% of patients were negative for e-cadherin and ALDH1, respectively. Positive AR immunostaining was inversely correlated with a higher Ki-67 (p < 0.0001) and a lympho-vascular invasion (p = 0.01), but no other variables. Univariate survival analysis revealed that AR expression was not associated with disease-free survival (p = 0.72) or overall survival (p = 0.93). Conclusions: The expression of AR is associated with some biological features of TNBC, such as Ki-67 and lympho-vascular invasion; nevertheless the prognostic significance of AR was not documented in our analysis. However, since ARs are expressed in a significant number of TNBC, prospective studies in order to determine the biological mechanisms and their potential role as novel treatment target."

Its treatment has been challenging due to its heterogeneity and absence of well-defined molecular targets. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify novel agents with therapeutic application. NF-κB is over-expressed in many breast cancers; thus, inactivation of the NF-κB pathway could serve as a therapeutic target. Here we report for the first time the anti-tumor activity of panepoxydone (PP), a NF-κB inhibitor isolated from an edible mushroom, in several breast cancer cell lines. Methods We investigated the effects of PP on cell growth, migration-invasion, apoptosis and EMT-related proteins expression in MCF-7 and TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-453. Results Significant antitumor activity was seen in all cell lines, with differential responses noted in cell-line specific manner. Treatment with PP resulted in significant cytotoxicity, decreased invasion, migration and increased apoptosis in all cell lines tested. Up-regulation of Bax and cleaved PARP and down-regulation of Bcl-2, survivin, cyclin D1 and caspase 3 were noted in PP-treated breast cancer cells. The antitumor effect of PP appeared related to its ability to inhibit the phosphorylation of inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBα) with cytoplasmic accumulation. PP treatment also down-regulated FOXM1 which resulted in a reversal of EMT. Similar results were obtained after silencing of NF-kB and FOXM1. Conclusion Altogether, these studies show, for the first time the antitumor activity of PP against breast cancer cells, in particular TNBC cells. Furthermore, it highlights the concept that optimal treatment of TNBC warrants attention to the differential sensitivity of various TNBC subtypes to therapeutic agents. These results suggest that the PP may be a potentially effective chemopreventive or therapeutic agent against breast cancer. However, additional studies are required to more fully elucidate the mechanism of antitumor effect of PP."

Doxorubicin is considered to be one of the most effective agents in the treatment of TNBC. Unfortunately, resistance to this agent is common. In some drug-resistant cells, drug efflux is mediated by adenosine triphosphate-dependent membrane transporter termed adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, which can drive the substrates across membranes against concentration gradient. In the tumor microenvironment, upon interaction with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), tumor cells exhibit altered biological functions of certain gene clusters, hence increasing stemness of tumor cells, migration ability, angiogenesis, and drug resistance. In our present study, we investigated the mechanism of TNBC drug resistance induced by adipose-derived MSCs. Upon exposure of TNBC to MSC-secreted conditioned medium (CM), noticeable drug resistance against doxorubicin with markedly increased BCRP protein expression was observed. Intracellular doxorubicin accumulation of TNBC was also decreased by MSC-secreted CM. Furthermore, we found that doxorubicin resistance of TNBC was mediated by IL-8 presented in the MSC-secreted CM. These findings may enrich the list of potential targets for overcoming drug resistance induced by MSCs in TNBC patients."

Medium-throughput results were scrutinized and extensively analyzed for sensitivity patterns, synergy, anticancer activity, and were validated in low-throughput experiments. Principal component analysis revealed that a fraction of all upregulated or downregulated genes of a particular targeted pathway could partly explain cell sensitivity toward agents targeting that pathway. Combination therapies deemed immediately tractable to translation included ABT-263/crizotinib, ABT-263/paclitaxel, paclitaxel/JQ1, ABT-263/XL-184, and paclitaxel/nutlin-3, all of which exhibited synergistic antiproliferative and apoptotic activity in multiple TNBC backgrounds. Mechanistic investigations of the ABT-263/crizotinib combination offering a potentially rapid path to clinic demonstrated RTK blockade, inhibition of mitogenic signaling, and proapoptotic signal induction in basal and mesenchymal stem-like TNBC.

TNBCs frequently overexpress epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and membrane bound estrogen receptor, GPER. To a certain extent the growth of TNBCs is stimulated by 17β-estradiol via GPER. We analyzed whether inhibition of EGFR by gefitinib reduces the expression of GPER and subsequent signal transduction in TNBC cells. Dependence of proliferation on 17β-estradiol was determined using Alamar Blue assay. Expression of GPR30 and activation of c-src, EGFR and cAMP-responsive element binding (CREB) protein by 17β-estradiol was analyzed by western blotting. Expression of c-fos, cyclin D1 and aromatase was determined using RT-PCR. Gefitinib reduced GPER expression concentration‑ and time‑dependently. In HCC70 cells, GPER expression was reduced to 15±11% (p<0.05) after treatment with 200 nM gefitinib for four days, and in HCC1806 cells GPER expression was reduced to 39±5% (p<0.01) of the control. 17β-estradiol significantly increased the percentage of HCC1806 cells within 7 days to 145±29% of the control (HCC70, 110±8%). This increase in cell growth was completely prevented in both TNBC cell lines after GPR30 expression was downregulated by treatment with 200 nM gefitinib. In HCC1806 cells, activation of c-src was increased by 17β-estradiol to 350±50% (p<0.01), and gefitinib reduced src activation to 110%. Similar results were obtained in the HCC70 cells. Phosphorylation of EGFR increased to 240±40% (p<0.05) in the HCC1806 cells treated with 17β-estradiol (HCC70, 147±25%). Gefitinib completely prevented this activation. Phosphorylation of CREB and induction of c-fos, cyclin D1 and aromatase expression by 17β-estradiol were all prevented by gefitinib. These experiments conclusively show that reduction of GPER expression is a promising therapeutic approach for TNBC."

Previous studies examined the general association between alcohol consumption and breast cancer risk; however, the risk for different breast cancer subtypes has been rarely reported. Triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer lacking hormone receptors and HER2 expression, and having poor prognosis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of TNBC etiology remains a significant challenge. In this study, we investigated cellular responses to alcohol in two TNBC cell lines, MDA‐MB‐231 and MDA‐MB‐468. Our results showed that alcohol at low concentrations (0.025–0.1% v/v) induced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in 1% FBS‐containing medium. Molecular analysis indicated that these phenotypic changes were associated with alcohol‐induced reactive oxygen species production and increased p38 and JNK phosphorylation. Likewise, p38 or JNK inhibition attenuated alcohol‐induced cell migration and invasion. We revealed that alcohol treatment activated/phosphorylated NF‐κB regulators and increased transcription of NF‐κB‐targeted genes. While examining the role of acetaldehyde, the major alcohol metabolite, in alcohol‐associated responses in TNBC cells, we saw that acetaldehyde induced cell migration, invasion, and increased phospho‐p38, phospho‐JNK, and phospho‐IκBα in a pattern similar to alcohol treatment. Taken together, we established that alcohol promotes TNBC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. The underlying mechanisms involve the induction of oxidative stress and the activation of NF‐κB signaling. In particular, the activation of p38 and JNK plays a pivotal role in alcohol‐induced cellular responses. These results will advance our understanding of alcohol‐mediated development and promotion of TNBC. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Methods: Total of 253 TNBC patients from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center who underwent treatment between January 2004 and December 2009 was conducted in this retrospective study. Before treatment serum ALP and LDH levels were routinely measured. We use the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to estimate the cutoff value of serum ALP and LDH levels. The Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable Cox regression analysis were used for Disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) assessed. Results: The ROC curves determined that the optimum cutoff point for ALP and LDH were 66.5u/L and 160.5u/L, respectively. The elevated ALP and LDH were both significantly associated with decreased DFS and OS (both P < 0.001). In addition, the entire cohort was stratified into three subgroups basis of ALP levels and LDH levels. TNBC Patients who with ALP >66.5 u/L and LDH >160.5u/L had the worst DFS and OS (both P < 0.001). In TNBC patients, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses conformed ALP and LDH were independent unfavorable prognostic factors for DFS and OS. Conclusions: The serum levels of ALP and LDH before treatment are independent prognostic parameters and may serve as complement to help predict survival in TNBC."

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), lacking expression of hormone and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 receptors, is an aggressive subtype that frequently metastasizes to the brain and has no FDA-approved systemic therapies. Previous literature demonstrates mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) pathway activation in TNBC brain metastases. Thus, we aimed to discover rational combinatorial therapies with MEK inhibition, hypothesizing that co-inhibition using clinically available brain-penetrant inhibitors would improve survival in preclinical models of TNBC brain metastases.


Methods
Using human-derived TNBC cell lines, synthetic lethal small interfering RNA kinase screens were evaluated with brain-penetrant inhibitors against MEK1/2 (selumetinib, AZD6244) or phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K; buparlisib, BKM120). Mice bearing intracranial TNBC tumors (SUM149, MDA-MB-231Br, MDA-MB-468, or MDA-MB-436) were treated with MEK, PI3K, or platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR; pazopanib) inhibitors alone or in combination. Tumors were analyzed by western blot and multiplexed kinase inhibitor beads/mass spectrometry to assess treatment effects.


Results
Screens identified MEK+PI3K and MEK+PDGFR inhibitors as tractable, rational combinations. Dual treatment of selumetinib with buparlisib or pazopanib was synergistic in TNBC cells in vitro. Both combinations improved survival in intracranial SUM149 and MDA-MB-231Br, but not MDA-MB-468 or MDA-MB-436. Treatments decreased mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and PI3K (Akt) signaling in sensitive (SUM149 and 231Br) but not resistant models (MDA-MB-468). Exploratory analysis of kinome reprogramming in SUM149 intracranial tumors after MEK ± PI3K inhibition demonstrates extensive kinome changes with treatment, especially in MAPK pathway members.


Conclusions
Results demonstrate that rational combinations of the clinically available inhibitors selumetinib with buparlisib or pazopanib may prove to be promising therapeutic strategies for the treatment of some TNBC brain metastases. Additionally, effective combination treatments cause widespread alterations in kinase pathways, including targetable potential resistance drivers."

The androgen receptor (AR) has recently emerged as a prognostic and treatment-predictive marker in breast cancer. However, the role of AR in TNBC remained elusive. Methods: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect AR and G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) expression in tissue microarrays of 165 TNBC patients. Microarray analysis of mRNAs was performed to identify downstream regulators of AR. TNBC cells were cultured with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) alone or in combination with AR knockdown performed with AR shRNA. Cell viability and colony formation were assessed. Western blotting and qRT-PCR were used to examine protein and mRNA expression, respectively. The potential mechanism of AR-mediated GPER suppression was identified by Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. AR and GPER expressions were also assessed in nude mouse xenografts by IHC. Results: IHC staining showed that the expression of AR was positively associated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis and high-grade tumor in TNBC patients. AR activation triggered by DHT suppressed GPER expression, to promote cell growth of TNBC. G-1, a GPER agonist, inhibited DHT-stimulated proliferation. Further experiments illustrated that AR suppressed GPER activation via binding directly to the promoter of GPER. Moreover, a negative correlation between AR and GPER was observed in MDA-MB-231 tumor cell xenografts and TNBC patient samples. Conclusions: The suppression of GPER via AR may be involved in the positive actions towards the TNBC progression, making it a promising therapeutic target for TNBC treatment."

Here, we report that ADAM8 is abundantly expressed in breast tumors and derived metastases compared to normal tissue, especially in triple‐negative breast cancers (TNBCs). Furthermore, high ADAM8 levels predicted poor patient outcome. Consistently, ADAM8 promoted an aggressive phenotype of TNBC cells in culture. In a mouse orthotopic model, tumors derived from TNBC cells with ADAM8 knockdown failed to grow beyond a palpable size and displayed poor vascularization. Circulating tumor cells and brain metastases were also significantly reduced. Mechanistically, ADAM8 stimulated both angiogenesis through release of VEGF‐A and transendothelial cell migration via β1‐integrin activation. In vivo, treatment with an anti‐ADAM8 antibody from the time of cell inoculation reduced primary tumor burden and metastases. Furthermore, antibody treatment of established tumors profoundly decreased metastases in a resection model. As a non‐essential protein under physiological conditions, ADAM8 represents a promising novel target for treatment of TNBCs, which currently lack targeted therapies and frequently progress with fatal dissemination."

TNBC, which represents approximately 15% of all mammary tumours, has a poor prognosis because of an aggressive behaviour and the lack of specific treatment. Accordingly, TNBC has become a major focus of research into breast cancer and is now classified into several molecular subtypes, each with a different prognosis. Pathological angiogenesis occurs at a late stage in the proliferation of TNBC and is associated with invasion and metastasis; there is an association with metabolic syndrome. Semaphorins are a versatile family of proteins with multiple roles in angiogenesis, tumour growth and metastasis and may represent a clinically useful focus for therapeutic targeting in this type of breast cancer. Another important field of investigation into the control of pathological angiogenesis is related to the expression of noncoding RNA (ncRNA) – these molecules can be considered as a therapeutic target or as a biomarker. Several molecular agents for intervening in the activity of different signalling pathways are being explored in TNBC, but none has so far proved effective in clinical trials and the disease continues to pose a defining challenge for clinical management as well as innovative cancer research."

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), as a non-invasive “liquid biopsy”, is an emerging original blood-based biomarker for early breast cancer diagnosis, monitoring treatment response, and determining prognosis. In TNBC patients, ctDNA has an inherent tendency to characterize tumor heterogeneity and metastasis-specific mutations providing a key alternative to tumor tissue profiling. Several studies have already demonstrated the potential of ctDNA in TNBC patients from early to advanced stages of the disease including diagnosis, therapy decisions and assessment of prognosis. This review provides a critical brief summary of the evidence that gives credence to the utility of ctDNA as a biomarker for its role into clinical management in TNBC."

Due to lack of identified targets and molecular heterogeneity, conventional chemotherapy is the only available option for treatment of TNBC, but non-discordant positive therapeutic efficacy could not be achieved. Here, we demonstrated that these TNBC cells were sensitive to teriflunomide, which was a well-known immunomodulatory drug for treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). Potent anti-cancer effects in TNBC in vitro, including proliferation inhibition, cell cycle delay, cell apoptosis, and suppression of cell motility and invasiveness, could be achieved with this agent. Of note, we showed that multiple signals involved in TNBC proliferation, survival, migratory, and invasive potential were under regulation by teriflunomide. Among them, we identified down-regulation of growth factor receptors to abolish growth maintenance, suppression of c-Myc, and cyclin D1 to contribute to its anti-proliferative effect, modulation of components of cell cycle to induce S-phase arrest, degradation of Bcl-xL, and up-regulation of BAX via activation of MAPK pathway to induce apoptosis, and inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) expression, and inactivation of Src/FAK to reduce TNBC migration and invasion. The results identified teriflunomide may be of therapeutic benefit for the more aggressive and difficult-to-treat breast cancer subtype, indicating the use of teriflunomide for clinical trials for treatment of TNBC patients."

Aberrant dysregulation of lipid metabolism is associated with breast cancer progression, however, anti‐cancer mechanism of BME linking lipid metabolism in breast cancer growth remains unexplored. Here, we observed that accumulation of esterified cholesterol was reduced in BME treated TNBC cell lines as compared to control cells. We next evaluated expression levels of acyl‐CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT‐1) in TNBC cells treated with BME. Our results demonstrated that BME treatment inhibited ACAT‐1 expression in TNBC cells. Subsequently, we found that sterol regulatory element‐binding proteins‐1 and ‐2, and FASN was significantly reduced in BME treated TNBC cell lines. Low‐density lipoprotein receptor was also downregulated in BME treated TNBC cells as compared to control cells. We further demonstrated that BME feeding reduced tumor growth in TNBC mammospheres implanted into NSG mice, and inhibits ACAT‐1 expression. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating BME suppresses TNBC cell growth through ACAT‐1 inhibition, and have potential for additional therapeutic regimen against human breast cancer."

Inhibition of CDK2 was shown to decrease breast cancer oncogenesis. Eribulin chemotherapy was used effectively in the treatment of TNBC. To this end, we tested therapeutic efficacy of a novel CDK2/9 inhibitor, CYC065, eribulin, and the combination of CYC065 and eribulin in 3 different TNBC cell lines, and an in vivo xenograft model. Specifically, we characterized cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, cell cycle associated protein expression, treatment-related transcription factor activity, and tumor growth in TNBC. Treatment with CYC065 and eribulin in combination had a superior effect on decreasing cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and inhibiting migration in TNBC cell lines in vitro. Combination therapy inhibited non-canonical Smad3 phosphorylation at the T179 site in the protein linker region, and resulted in increased p15 and decreased c-myc expression. In a transcription factor array, combination treatment significantly increased activity of AP1 and decreased activity of factors including NFκB, SP1, E2F, and SMAD3. In an in vivo xenograft model of TNBC, individual and combination treatments resulted in a decrease in both tumor volume and mitotic indices. Taken together, these studies highlight the potential of this novel drug combination, CYC065 and eribulin, to suppress the growth of TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo, warranting further clinical investigation."

Cancers lacking expression of all three of these receptors (triple-negative breast cancer; TNBC) is of particular interest for molecular research because these tumors currently have no effective targets for therapy. Furthermore, TNBCs are relatively more prevalent among African-American women and can account for some of the health disparities associated with breast cancer. We approached a molecular understanding of how TNBC differs from ER(+) breast cancer through a comprehensive gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography (LC)/MS/MS-based and unbiased metabolomic analysis of a series of breast carcinomas from African-American patients. Remarkably, global metabolomic profiling of tumor tissues identified a total of 418 distinct metabolites, out of which 133 (31.8%) were shown to differ between the ER(+) and TNBC tumors with statistical probability of p<0.05. Specific biochemical pathways affected included those reflecting general increases in energy metabolism and transmethylation in the TNBC tumors when compared to ER(+) tumors. Additionally, biochemicals associated with increased proliferation, redox balance and the recently proposed oncometabolites, sarcosine and 2-hydroxyglutarate, were also detected at higher levels in the TNBC versus ER(+) tumors. These studies demonstrate that TNBC tumors have metabolic signatures that distinguish them from ER(+) tumors and suggest that distinctive metabolic characteristics of these tumors might offer new targets for treatment."

In contrast, tumors that are negative for these markers (triple-negative) have a disproportionate share of morbidity and mortality due to lack of a validated molecular target. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are a critical component of ubiquitin-proteasome-system degradation and have been shown to be differentially expressed and activated in a number of cancers, including breast, with their aberrant activity linked to cancer prognosis and clinical outcome. We evaluated the effect of the DUB inhibitors b-AP15 and RA-9 alone and in combination with early- and late-stage lysosomal inhibitors on cell viability in a panel of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines. Our results indicate small-molecule DUB inhibitors have a profound effect on TNBC viability and lead to activation of autophagy as a cellular mechanism to compensate for ubiquitin-proteasome-system stress. Treatment with sub-optimal doses of DUB and lysosome inhibitors synergistically kills TNBC cells. This supports the evaluation of DUB inhibition, in combination with lysosomal inhibition, as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of TNBC."

To date, platinum-based chemotherapy has played a significant role in the treatment of TNBC patients. However, some patients do not respond to platinum salts or gradually develop chemoresistance, resulting in little effect, or even some adverse effects. Here, we review numerous preclinical and clinical investigations to summarize possible mechanisms and potential predictive biomarkers of platinum in TNBC. The homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) resulting from the loss of BRCA function is the main rationale of platinum efficacy in TNBC. BRCA mutation and methylation have been demonstrated to be important potential biomarkers. Based on genome-wide effects, BRCA-like classifier can identify the functional loss of BRCA and work as the predictor. HRD score that is able to identify the “BRCAness” and predict the sensitivity of platinum is increasingly considered. Taken together, all findings suggest that HR deficiency profile encompassed by BRCA mutation and high HRD score could predict response to platinum, even to other DNA-damage inducing agents. p53 family members and molecular subtypes of TNBC are also important alternative considerations for predicting platinum response based on the preclinical trials. Currently, tumor infiltrating lymphocyte level and thrombocytopenia are emerging as predictive biomarkers."

We previously demonstrated involvement of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor entinostat in regulating apoptosis in IBC and TNBC cells; here, we aimed to identify novel combination therapy candidates. Experimental Design: Potential therapeutic targets were identified by mRNA expression profiling of TNBC and IBC cells treated with entinostat. Drug action and synergism were assessed by in vitro proliferation assays, tumor growth in vivo, and proteomic analyses. Gain/loss-of-expression studies were utilized to functionally validate the role of identified targets in sensitivity of TNBC and IBC cells to combination therapy. Results: Entinostat induced activity of the oncogenic ERK pathway and expression of proapoptotic NOXA. These are known to stabilize and degrade, respectively, MCL1, an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein. In breast cancer patients, high-MCL1/low-NOXA tumor expression correlated significantly with poor survival outcomes. Combination treatment of entinostat with MEK inhibitor pimasertib reduced the growth of TNBC and IBC cells in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. The synergistic action of combination therapy was observed in TNBC and IBC cell lines in which NOXA expression was induced following entinostat treatment. The therapeutic activity depended on induction of mitochondrial cell death pathways initiated by NOXA-mediated MCL1 degradation. Conclusions: Our preclinical findings provide a rationale for the clinical testing of combination HDAC and MEK pathway inhibition for TNBC and IBC that exhibit elevated baseline tumor MCL1 expression.

To clarify the molecular mechanisms involved in the carcinogenesis of TNBC and to identify target molecules for novel anticancer drugs, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of 30 TNBCs as well as 13 normal epithelial ductal cells that were purified by laser-microbeam microdissection. We identified 301 and 321 transcripts that were significantly upregulated and downregulated in TNBC, respectively. In particular, gene expression profile analyses of normal human vital organs allowed us to identify 104 cancer-specific genes, including those involved in breast carcinogenesis such as NEK2, PBK and MELK. Moreover, gene annotation enrichment analysis revealed prominent gene subsets involved in the cell cycle, especially mitosis. Therefore, we focused on cell cycle regulators, asp (abnormal spindle) homolog, microcephaly-associated (Drosophila) (ASPM) and centromere protein K (CENPK) as novel therapeutic targets for TNBC. Small-interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of their expression significantly attenuated TNBC cell viability due to G1 and G2/M cell cycle arrest. Our data will provide a better understanding of the carcinogenesis of TNBC and could contribute to the development of molecular targets as a treatment for TNBC patients."

However, we, and others, have demonstrated that approximately 30% of TNBCs express estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), a nuclear hormone receptor and potential drug target. Treatment of ERβ expressing MDA-MB-231 cells with estrogen or the ERβ selective agonist, LY500307, was shown to result in suppression of cell proliferation. This inhibitory effect was due to blockade of cell cycle progression. In vivo, estrogen treatment significantly repressed the growth of ERβ expressing MDA-MB-231 cell line xenografts. Gene expression studies and ingenuity pathway analysis identified a network of ERβ down-regulated genes involved in cell cycle progression including CDK1, cyclin B and cyclin H. siRNA mediated knockdown or drug inhibition of CDK1 and CDK7 in TNBC cells resulted in substantial decreases in proliferation regardless of ERβ expression. These data suggest that the tumor suppressive effects of ERβ in TNBC result from inhibition of cell cycle progression, effects that are in part mediated by suppression of CDK1/7. Furthermore, these data indicate that blockade of CDK1/7 activity in TNBC may be of therapeutic benefit, an area of study that has yet to be explored."

CD8+ T cell-mediated immunotherapy may represent an attractive approach to address TNBC. The objectives of this study were to assess the expression of CXorf61 in TNBCs and healthy tissues and to evaluate its capability to induce T cell responses. We show by transcriptional profiling of a broad comprehensive set of normal human tissue that CXorf61 expression is strictly restricted to testis. 53% of TNBC patients express this antigen in at least 30% of their tumor cells. In CXorf61-negative breast cancer cell lines CXorf61 expression is activated by treatment with the hypomethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine. By vaccination of HLA-A*02-transgenic mice with CXorf61 encoding RNA we obtained high frequencies of CXorf61-specific T cells. Cloning and characterization of T cell receptors (TCRs) from responding T cells resulted in the identification of the two HLA-A*0201-restricted T cell epitopes CXorf6166–74 and CXorf6179–87. Furthermore, by in vitro priming of human CD8+ T cells derived from a healthy donor recognizing CXorf6166–74 we were able to induce a strong antigen-specific immune response and clone a human TCR recognizing this epitope. In summary, our data confirms this antigen as promising target for T cell based therapies."

We demonstrated that low tumor TLR9 expression predicts poor disease-specific survival in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We hypothesized that this is because TLR9 expression affects tumor immunophenotype. To begin to test this, we compared the number of tumor infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes with TLR9 expression in treatment naïve breast cancer (n = 197) and RCC (n = 94) cohorts with known TLR9 expression status. CD8+ T lymphocyte counts were assayed with image analysis after immunohistochemistry (IHC). Tumor TLR9 expression was not correlated with CD8+ T cell counts in breast cancer or RCC. CD8+ T cell counts were significantly associated with tumor proliferation index in TNBC, but not in non-TNBC. CD8+ T cell counts were also significantly associated with tumor grade in non-TNBC, but not in TNBC. In RCC, CD8+ T cell counts were significantly associated with tumor stage. CD8+ T cell counts were significantly associated with prognosis in TNBC and RCC, but the presence of CD8+ T cells in these tumors had opposite effects on disease-specific survival: High CD8+ counts were associated with better prognosis in TNBC and worse prognosis in RCC. Among TNBC patients, those with low tumor TLR9 and low CD8+ T cell counts had the poorest prognosis (log-rank p = 0.0002 vs. high tumor TLR9 and high CD8+ T cell count). In conclusion, pre-treatment tumor TLR9 status is not associated with tumor infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes in TNBC or RCC. The combination of TLR9 and CD8+ TIL count might be a novel composite prognostic marker in TNBC."

Among the various molecular subtypes of breast cancer, it was observed that TNBCs express elevated levels of sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) compared to other breast tumor subtypes. High levels of SPHK1 gene expression correlated with poor overall and progression- free survival, as well as poor response to Doxorubicin-based treatment. Inhibition of SPHK1 was found to attenuate ERK1/2 and AKT signaling and reduce growth of TNBC cells in vitro and in a xenograft SCID mouse model. Moreover, SPHK1 inhibition by siRNA knockdown or treatment with SKI-5C sensitizes TNBCs to chemotherapeutic drugs. Our findings suggest that SPHK1 inhibition, which effectively counteracts oncogenic signaling through ERK1/2 and AKT pathways, is a potentially important anti-tumor strategy in TNBC. A combination of SPHK1 inhibitors with chemotherapeutic agents may be effective against this aggressive subtype of breast cancer."

This phase 2 trial assessed efficacy and safety of single-agent dasatinib in patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Experimental Design: Female patients with measurable, locally advanced or metastatic TNBC initially received dasatinib 100 mg twice daily (BID); to improve tolerability, the protocol was amended and subsequent patients received 70 mg BID. Primary endpoint was Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors–defined objective response rate (ORR); secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), safety, and limited pharmacokinetics. Results: Of the 44 treated patients, 43 were response evaluable. ORR was 4.7%: two patients had confirmed partial responses lasting 14 and 58 weeks, respectively. Of 11 patients with stable disease, two continued for more than 16 weeks, thus protocol-defined DCR was 9.3%. Median PFS was 8.3 weeks (95% CI: 7.3–15.3). Five patients discontinued before first tumor assessment. No grade 4 adverse events (AE) were reported; grade 3 AEs occurring in more than 5% of patients were fatigue (9.1%), diarrhea, pleural effusion, and dyspnea (all 6.8%). Laboratory abnormalities were uncommon. Dasatinib at 100 mg BID was not well tolerated; rates of treatment interruption, dose reduction, and serious AEs were lower with dasatinib 70 mg BID. Conclusions: Single-agent dasatinib has limited activity in unselected patients with TNBC. Dasatinib 70 mg BID was better tolerated than 100 mg BID.

Chemotherapy is the main therapeutic strategy for such patients with breast cancer, although the outcome is often unsatisfactory. Thus, the development of combination adjuvant therapies is essential for improved prognosis in patients with TNBC. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of a sequential combination of cytokine-induced killer cell (CIK) infusion and chemotherapy for patients with post-mastectomy TNBC. Experimental Design: From 2008 to 2012, 90 patients with post-mastectomy TNBC were included in this retrospective study: 45 cases received chemotherapy alone or with sequential radiotherapy; a further 45 cases received chemotherapy with/without radiotherapy and sequential CIK infusion. Results: Survival analysis showed significantly higher disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates in the CIK treatment group compared with the control group (P = 0.0382, P = 0.0046, respectively; log-rank test). Multivariate survival analysis showed that CIK adjuvant treatment was an independent prognostic factor for OS of patients with TNBC. In subgroup analyses, CIK adjuvant treatment significantly increased the DFS rate of patients with pathologic grade 3, and significantly increased the OS rate of patients in N1, N2, N3, IIB, III TNM (tumor–node–metastasis) stages, and with pathologic grade 3. Conclusions: These data indicate that adjuvant CIK treatment combined with chemotherapy is an effective therapeutic strategy to prevent disease recurrence and prolong survival of patients with TNBC, particularly those with lymph node metastasis, advanced TNM stage, and poor pathologic grade.

We exploited genomics data to identify commonly occurring alterations in G-protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subset of breast cancer with poor prognosis and lacking effective targeted therapy. We have discovered that the orphan GPCR, G-protein–coupled receptor 161 (GPR161), is overexpressed specifically in TNBC and correlates with poor prognosis. We identify GPR161 as a regulator of mammary epithelial cell proliferation and invasion in a mammalian target of rapamycin signaling-pathway–dependent manner. Down-regulation of GPR161 in a TNBC-derived cell line impairs cell growth, suggesting that GPR161 is a drug target for breast cancer. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 20% of breast cancer in women and lacks an effective targeted therapy. Therefore, finding common vulnerabilities in these tumors represents an opportunity for more effective treatment. Despite the growing appreciation of G-protein–coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated signaling in cancer pathogenesis, very little is known about the role GPCRs play in TNBC. Using genomic information of human breast cancer, we have discovered that the orphan GPCR, G-protein–coupled receptor 161 (GPR161) is overexpressed specifically in TNBC and correlates with poor prognosis. Knockdown of GPR161 impairs proliferation of human basal breast cancer cell lines. Overexpression of GPR161 in human mammary epithelial cells increases cell proliferation, migration, intracellular accumulation of E-cadherin, and formation of multiacinar structures in 3D culture. GPR161 forms a signaling complex with the scaffold proteins β-arrestin 2 and Ile Gln motif containing GTPase Activating Protein 1, a regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 and E-cadherin. Consistently, GPR161 amplified breast tumors and cells overexpressing GPR161 activate mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and decrease Ile Gln motif containing GTPase Activating Protein 1 phosphorylation. Thus, we identify the orphan GPCR, GPR161, as an important regulator and a potential drug target for TNBC."

The TNBC subtype primarily occurs in younger women of African American or Hispanic descent and tumors tend to be high grade and initially responsive to chemotherapy. However, TNBC is characteristically aggressive with high recurrence, metastatic, and mortality rates. Treatment options are limited since the hormonal receptor and HER-2 antagonists typically used for other breast cancers are ineffective. As such, the mainstay of treatment of TNBC is traditional systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy. Potential future therapies for TNBC include targeted molecular strategies including poly (adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase (PARP) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors and antiangiogenic agents. Further research aimed at identifying unique genetic characteristics of TNBC may allow development of other targeted molecular chemotherapy treatment options."

Methods Our institutional database was queried for all patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between January 2010 and May 2016. Results Out of a total of 1964 patients, 190 (10%) patients had TNBC. The median age for both TNBC and non-TNBC was 59 years. There was a significantly higher proportion of African American and Asian patients with TNBC (p = 0.0003) compared to patients with non-TNBC. BRCA1 and BRCA2 were significantly associated with TNBC (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0007). A prior history of breast cancer was significantly associated with TNBC (p = 0.0003). There was no relationship observed between TNBC and a history of chemoprevention or patients who had a history of AH or LCIS. Conclusions We found that having Asian ancestry, a prior history of breast cancer, and a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation all appear to be positively associated with TNBC. In order to develop more effective treatments, better surveillance, and improved prevention strategies, it is necessary to improve our understanding of the population at risk for TNBC."

However, the role of STC‑1 has not been fully elucidated in breast cancer cells. Here, we investigated whether STC‑1 acts as a prognostic factor in triple‑negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients, and we explored the cellular mechanism in breast cancer cells. The level of STC‑1 expression was directly associated with the relapse‑free and overall survival of basal‑type breast cancer patients. Breast cancer patients with a high level of STC‑1 had poor prognosis. In addition, our results showed that the level of STC‑1 expression was markedly higher in TNBC than in non‑TNBC cells. Invasiveness of the TNBC cells was also significantly increased in response to recombinant human STC‑1 treatment. In contrast, the invaded cell numbers were completely decreased by STC‑1 siRNA overexpression in the Hs578T and MDA‑MB‑231 TNBC cells. Our results showed that the phosphorylation of c‑Jun N‑terminal protein kinase (JNK) and c‑Jun was increased after STC‑1 treatment but not the phosphorylation of ERK and p38 MAPKs in the Hs578T and MDA‑MB‑231 TNBC cells. Furthermore, expression of one invasion‑related gene MMP‑9, was increased by STC‑1 treatment. STC‑1‑induced MMP‑9 expression was suppressed by SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) in the Hs578T cells. STC‑1‑induced cell invasiveness was also inhibited by SP600125. Taken together, we demonstrated that aberrant STC‑1 expression is associated with poor prognosis and stimulates the invasiveness of TNBC cells through the JNK/c‑Jun‑dependent signaling pathway."

Expression of the tumor suppressors PTEN and INPP4B was lost in 55% and 76% of TNBC PDX, respectively, while mutations in PIK3CA and AKT1 genes were rare. In 7 PDX treatment with everolimus resulted in a tumor growth inhibition higher than 50%, while 8 models were classified as low responder or resistant. Basal-like, LAR (Luminal AR), mesenchymal and HER2-enriched tumors were present in both responder and resistant groups, suggesting that tumor response to everolimus is not restricted to a specific TNBC subtype. Analysis of treated tumors showed a correlation between tumor response and post-treatment phosphorylation of AKT, increased in responder PDX, while PI3K pathway markers at baseline were not sufficient to predict everolimus response. In conclusion, targeting mTOR decreased tumor growth in 7 out of 15 TNBC PDX tested.

We investigated the number of tumor-infiltrating FOXP3-positive Tregs in formalin-fixed TNBC specimens obtained from patients who received palliative treatment between 1999 and 2007. Material and methods. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess the number of CD4+, CD25+, and FOXP3+ Tregs in tumor tissue and normal breast tissue from 86 TNBC patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses evaluated outcomes according to the number of FOXP3-positive Tregs. Results. Of the 86 tumor specimens, 22 (25.6%) expressed more than 15 FOXP3-positive Tregs per 10 high power fields in the peritumoral area. On multivariate analysis, staining showing ≥ 15 FOXP3-positive Tregs was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and progression free survival with hazard ratios of 2.4 (95% CI 1.0–5.6; p = 0.049) and 2.0 (95% CI 1.1–3.6; p = 0.032), respectively. In TNBC, FOXP3-positive Tregs had stronger prognostic significance than did FOXP3-negative Tregs. The finding of improved survival associated with highly infiltrating FOXP3-positive Tregs in TNBC contrasted with several other types of solid cancer. Conclusion. TNBC may be differently driven by FOXP3 via an immune mechanism. The inclusion of FOXP3+ Tregs may help to improve prognostication for TNBC."
Quercetin induces apoptosis in triple-negative breast cancer cells via inhibiting fatty acid synthase and β-catenin,"[{'authorId': '4095012', 'name': 'A.

The increased research interests in TNBC nowadays are due to the lack of clinically validated and molecular-targeted therapy. Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN) is the major biosynthetic enzyme for the synthesis of fatty acids from small carbon substrates. Elevated expression of FASN is frequent phenotypic alterations in many human cancers. The flavonoid Quercetin is one of the most abundant bioflavonoids in the human diet and a known inducer of apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. We aimed to evaluate the effects of Quercetin on TNBC in vitro and in vivo. Quercetin induced a significant growth-inhibitory effect against TNBC cells and the IC50 were 230 ± 3 and 415 ± 4 μM for the TNBC cells, MDAMB-231 and MDA-MB-157 respectively. Quercetin treatment induced anticancer/apoptotic effects against TNBC cells as shown by morphological alterations, DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3 activation. When compared to controls, decreased protein expression of FASN, β-catenin, Bcl-2, and reduced-nuclear accumulation of β-catenin were detected after Quercetin treatment. Quercetin in vivo-treatment induced significant tumor growth inhibition by 41.7% after 25 days of treatment. Immunohistochemical data showed a clear inhibition of FASN expression in tumor xenografts after Quercetin treatment. Quercetin possibly targets the lipogenic enzyme FASN and β-catenin in TNBCs. Quercetin-induced apoptosis via targeting the de novo fatty acid synthesis is likely through a caspase-3 dependent mechanism coupled with modulation of FASN and β-catenin expressions."

The current population-based study investigated the early survival pattern of elderly women with TNBC and identified outcome-correlated factors. Patients and Methods We searched the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and enrolled female primary non-metastatic TNBC cases. The patients were subdivided into elderly (≥70 years) and young groups (<70 years). The survival status of elderly patients was compared to that of the younger women. The primary and secondary endpoints were cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) respectively. Results 9908 female TNBC patients diagnosed from 2010 to 2011 were included in the current study (20.4% elderly). Elderly patients with relatively advanced diseases exhibited distinctly worse cancer-specific (log-rank, p<0.001) and overall survival (log-rank, p<0.001) than their young counterparts. Advanced age at diagnosis (≥70 years) was significantly predictive of poor outcome in terms of CSS (hazard ratio (HR), 2.125; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.664 to 2.713; p<0.001) and OS (HR, 3.042; 95%CI, 2.474 to 3.740; p<0.001). Underuse of curative treatment especially radiotherapy was more prevalent in elderly women with stage II or III diseases than in younger patients. Conclusion Elderly patients with TNBC displayed elevated early mortality within the first two years of diagnosis compared to the younger individuals. The observed lower rate of loco-regional treatment might be associated with worse cancer-specific outcome for these patients."

Different mechanisms have been hypothesized to be involved in this phenomenon, including receptor tyrosine kinase‐dependent activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. In this study, we analyzed the effects of the MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib in combination with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib in a panel of TNBC cell lines that showed different levels of sensitivity to single‐agent selumetinib: SUM‐149 and MDA‐MB‐231 cells resulted to be sensitive, whereas SUM‐159, MDA‐MB‐468 and HCC70 cells were relatively resistant to the drug. Treatment of TNBC cells with selumetinib produced an increase of the phosphorylation of the EGFR both in selumetinib‐sensitive SUM‐149, MDA‐MB‐231 and in selumetinib‐resistant MDA‐MB‐468 TNBC cells. The combination of selumetinib and gefitinib resulted in a synergistic growth inhibitory effect in all the TNBC cell lines, although the IC50 was not reached in SUM‐159 and MDA‐MB‐468 cells. This effect was associated with an almost complete suppression of ERK1/2 activation and a reduction of selumetinib‐induced AKT phosphorylation. In addition, in selumetinib‐sensitive TNBC cells the combination of selumetinib and gefitinib induced a significant G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Taken together, our data demonstrated that blockade of the EGFR might efficiently increase the antitumor activity of selumetinib in a subgroup of TNBC and that this phenomenon might be related to the effects of such combination on both ERK1/2 and AKT activation.

Advances in the treatment of TNBC have been hampered by the lack of novel effective targeted therapies. The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of targeting Aurora kinase A (AurA), a key regulator of mitosis, in TNBC models. A secondary objective was to determine the role of the p53 family of transcriptional regulators, commonly mutated in TNBC, in determining the phenotypic response to the AurA inhibitor alisertib (MLN8237). Alisertib exhibited potent antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity in a subset of TNBC models. The induction of apoptosis in response to alisertib exposure was dependent on p53 and p73 activity. In the absence of functional p53 or p73, there was a shift in the phenotypic response following alisertib exposure from apoptosis to cellular senescence. In addition, senescence was observed in patient-derived tumor xenografts with acquired resistance to alisertib treatment. AurA inhibitors are a promising class of novel therapeutics in TNBC. The role of p53 and p73 in mediating the phenotypic response to antimitotic agents in TNBC may be harnessed to develop an effective biomarker selection strategy in this difficult to target disease.

This study aimed to identify and validate a prognostic signature for TNBC patients to improve prognostic capability and to guide individualized treatment. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the prognostic performance of clinicopathological characteristics and miRNAs in a training set of 58 patients with invasive ductal TNBC diagnosed between 2002 and 2012. A prediction model was developed based on independent clinicopathological and miRNA covariates. The prognostic value of the model was further validated in a separate set of 41 TNBC patients diagnosed between 2007 and 2008. Results Only lymph node status was marginally significantly associated with poor prognosis of TNBC (P = 0.054), whereas other clinicopathological factors, including age, tumor size, histological grade, lymphovascular invasion, P53 status, Ki-67 index, and type of surgery, were not. The expression levels of miR-27b-3p, miR-107, and miR-103a-3p were significantly elevated in the metastatic group compared with the disease-free group (P value: 0.008, 0.005, and 0.050, respectively). The Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that lymph node status and miR-27b-3p were independent predictors of poor prognosis (P value: 0.012 and 0.027, respectively). A logistic regression model was developed based on these two independent covariates, and the prognostic value of the model was subsequently confirmed in a separate validation set. The two different risk groups, which were stratified according to the model, showed significant differences in the rates of distant metastasis and breast cancer-related death not only in the training set (P value: 0.001 and 0.040, respectively) but also in the validation set (P value: 0.013 and 0.012, respectively). Conclusion This model based on miRNA and node status covariates may be used to stratify TNBC patients into different prognostic subgroups for potentially individualized therapy."

One such adaptive pathway is the unfolded protein (UPR) or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response mediated in part by the ER-localized transmembrane sensor IRE12 and its substrate XBP13. Previous studies report UPR activation in various human tumors4-6, but XBP1's role in cancer progression in mammary epithelial cells is largely unknown. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a form of breast cancer in which tumor cells do not express the genes for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Her2/neu, is a highly aggressive malignancy with limited treatment options7, 8. Here, we report that XBP1 is activated in TNBC and plays a pivotal role in the tumorigenicity and progression of this human breast cancer subtype. In breast cancer cell line models, depletion of XBP1 inhibited tumor growth and tumor relapse and reduced the CD44high/CD24low population. Hypoxia-inducing factor (HIF)1α is known to be hyperactivated in TNBCs 9, 10. Genome-wide mapping of the XBP1 transcriptional regulatory network revealed that XBP1 drives TNBC tumorigenicity by assembling a transcriptional complex with HIF1α that regulates the expression of HIF1α targets via the recruitment of RNA polymerase II. Analysis of independent cohorts of patients with TNBC revealed a specific XBP1 gene expression signature that was highly correlated with HIF1α and hypoxia-driven signatures and that strongly associated with poor prognosis. Our findings reveal a key function for the XBP1 branch of the UPR in TNBC and imply that targeting this pathway may offer alternative treatment strategies for this aggressive subtype of breast cancer. We determined UPR activation status in several breast cancer cell lines (BCCL). XBP1 expression was readily detected in both luminal and basal-like BCCL, but was higher in the latter which consist primarily of TNBC cells and also in primary TNBC patient samples (Fig. 1a, b). PERK but not ATF6 was also activated (Extended Data 1a) and transmission electron microscopy revealed more abundant and dilated ER in multiple TNBC cell lines (Extended Data 1b). These data reveal a state of basal ER stress in TNBC cells. XBP1 silencing impaired soft agar colony forming ability and invasiveness (Extended Data 1c) of multiple TNBC cell lines, indicating that XBP1 regulates TNBC anchorageindependent growth and invasiveness. We next used an orthotopic xenograft mouse model with inducible expression of two XBP1 shRNAs in MDA-MB-231 cells. Tumor growth and metastasis to lung were significantly inhibited by XBP1 shRNAs (Fig. 1c-e, Extended Data 1d-g). This was not due to altered apoptosis (Caspase 3), cell proliferation (Ki67) or hyperactivation of IRE1 and other UPR branches (Fig. 1e, Extended Data 1h, i). Instead, XBP1 depletion impaired angiogenesis as evidenced by the presence of fewer intratumoral blood vessels (CD31 staining) (Fig. 1e). Subcutaneous xenograft experiments using two other TNBC cell lines confirmed our findings (Extended Data 1j, k). Importantly, XBP1 Chen et al. Page 2 Nature.

N IH -P A A uhor M anscript N IH -P A A uhor M anscript N IH -P A A uhor M anscript silencing in a patient-derived TNBC xenograft model (BCM-2147) significantly decreased tumor incidence (Fig. 1f, Extended Data 1l, m). TNBC patients have the highest rate of relapse within 1-3 years despite adjuvant chemotherapy7, 8. To examine XBP1's effect on tumor relapse following chemotherapeutic treatment, we treated MDA-MB-231 xenograft bearing mice with doxorubicin and XBP1 shRNA. Strikingly, combination treatment not only blocked tumor growth but also inhibited or delayed tumor relapse (Fig. 2a). Tumor cells expressing CD44high/CD24low have been shown to mediate tumor relapse in some instances11-13. To test whether XBP1 targeted the CD44high/CD24low population, we examined the mammosphere-forming ability of cells derived from treated tumors (day 20). Mammosphere formation was increased in doxorubicin treated tumor cells, while tumors treated with doxorubicin plus XBP1 shRNA displayed substantially reduced mammosphere formation (Fig. 2b), a finding confirmed using another chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel (Extended Data 2a, b). Hypoxia activates the UPR, and XBP1 knockdown also dramatically reduced mammosphere formation in hypoxic conditions (Extended Data. 2b). Furthermore, CD44 expression was reduced in XBP1-depleted tumors (Extended Data 2c). To further interrogate XBP1's effect on CD44high/CD24low cell function, we used mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) carrying an inducible Src oncogene (ER-Src), where v-Src is fused with the estrogen receptor ligand binding domain14. Tamoxifen (TAM) treatment results in neoplastic transformation and gain of a CD44high/CD24low population that has been previously associated with tumor-initiating properties15. In transformed MCF10A-ERSrc cells, XBP1 splicing was increased in CD44high/CD24low population (Fig. 2c), while XBP1 silencing reduced the CD44high/CD24low fraction (Extended Data 2d, e) and markedly suppressed mammosphere formation (Extended Data 2f), phenotypes not attributable to a direct effect of XBP1 on cell viability (Extended Data 2g, h). Furthermore, limiting dilution experiments demonstrated loss of tumor-seeding ability in XBP1-depleted cells (Fig. 2d). CD44high/CD24low cells sorted from TNBC patient samples confirmed increased XBP1 splicing and other UPR markers, and XBP1 silencing impaired mammosphere-forming ability (Fig. 2e, f, Extended Data 3a). Conversely, XBP1s overexpression in CD44low/ CD24high cells resulted in gain of mammosphere-forming ability and increased resistance to doxorubicin treatment (Extended Data 3b, c). Strikingly, patient derived CD44low/CD24high cells overexpressing XBP1s, but not control parental cells, initiated tumor formation in immunodeficient mice (Extended Data 3d, e). These data establish a critical role of XBP1 in CD44high/CD24low cells within TNBC. ChIP-seq and motif analysis of XBP1 in MDA-MB-231 cells revealed statistically significant enrichment of both the HIF1α and XBP1 motifs (Fig. 3a, Extended Data 4a), suggesting frequent colocalization of HIF1α and XBP1 to the same regulatory elements. HIF1α is hyperactivated in TNBCs, required for the maintenance of CD44high/CD24low cells9, 10, 16, 17 and regulated in response to microenvironmental oxygen levels. XBP1 ChIPseq was therefore also performed in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells cultured under hypoxia and glucose deprivation conditions for 24h. Exposure to these stressors increased XBP1 splicing, resulting in a corresponding increase in signal intensity (Extended Data 4b-f) Chen et al. Page 3 Nature.

N IH -P A A uhor M anscript N IH -P A A uhor M anscript N IH -P A A uhor M anscript and further enrichment of HIF1α motifs in TNBC (Fig. 3a), but interestingly not in luminal breast cancer cells (Extended Data 4g). HIF1α motif enrichment in the XBP1 ChIP-seq dataset suggested that XBP1 and HIF1α might interact within the same transcriptional complex. Co-IP experiments revealed a physical interaction of HIF1α, but not HIF2α, with XBP1 in 293T cells co-expressing HIF1 and XBP1s cultured under hypoxic conditions, also observed with endogenous proteins in two TNBC cell lines: MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T (Fig. 3b, Extended Data 4h-j). Subcellular fractionation revealed that this interaction occurs in the nucleus, and that unspliced XBP1u protein was not detectable (Extended Data 4k, l). GST pull-down experiments showed that HIF1α interacts with the XBP1s N-terminus b-zip domain (Extended Data 4m, n). We next established that XBP1 and HIF1α co-occupied several well-known HIF1α targets using ChIP-qPCR (Extended Data 5a-c). ChIP-re-ChIP assays using anti-XBP1s followed by anti-HIF1α antibodies confirmed that XBP1s and HIF1α simultaneously co-occupy these common targets (Extended Data. 5d). DNA-pull down assays with an HIF1α18 specific probe precipitated XBP1s in MDA-MB-231 nuclear extracts under hypoxia, indicating their presence in the same complex (Extended Data 5e, f). XBP1 depletion by two independent shRNA constructs dramatically reduced hypoxia response element (HRE) luciferase activity under hypoxia (Fig. 3c). Conversely, XBP1s expression dose-dependently transactivated the HRE reporter (Extended Data 5g, h), confirming that XBP1 augments HIF1α activity. When we profiled the differential transcriptome induced by XBP1 silencing in MDAMB-231 cells, gene set enrichment analysis identified significant enrichment of HIF1α mediated hypoxia response pathway genes (Fig. 3d, Extended Data 6a). XBP1 depletion downregulated HIF1α targets VEGFA, PDK1, GLUT1, and DDIT4 expression in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Extended Data 6b), and these results were validated in breast cancer xenografts (Fig. 3e) and Hs578T cells (Extended Data 6c). However, XBP1 depletion in luminal tumors did not affect these targets (Extended Data 6d). To further explore the consequences of this cooperation, we examined how XBP1 or HIF1α loss affected the transcription of common target genes. We found that high occupancy by XBP1 was associated with increased occurrence of the HIF1α motif across the genome in TNBC (Fig. 3f). While XBP1 depletion had no immediate effect on HIF1α expression, it substantially attenuated concurrent HIF1α and RNA polymerase II occupancy (Extended Data 6e-g, Fig. 3g). Similarly, XBP1 and RNA Polymerase II occupancy at co-bound sites was likewise reduced in the absence of HIF1α under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3h, Extended Data 6h-l). These results indicate that the assembly of the XBP1-HIF1α complex on target promoters is crucial for their transcription, via the recruitment of RNA polymerase II. To establish whether HIF1α contributes to XBP1's function in TNBC, we performed rescue experiments using a HA"

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive disease with limited therapeutic options. Chemotherapy is still the first line for the treatment of TNBC patients; however, TNBC usually gains rapid resistance and unresponsiveness to chemotherapeutic drugs. In this study, we found that TRPV2 protein is highly up-regulated in TNBC tissues compared to normal breast tissues. We also observed that TNBC and estrogen receptor alpha negative (ERβ-) patients with higher TRPV2 expression have significantly higher recurrence free survival compared to patients with lower TRPV2 expression especially those who were treated with chemotherapy. In addition, we showed that TRPV2 overexpression or activation by CBD significantly increased doxorubicin (DOX) uptake and apoptosis in TNBC cells. The induction of DOX uptake was abrogated by TRPV2 blocking or downregulation. In vivo mouse model studies showed that the TNBC tumors derived from CBD+DOX treated mice have significantly reduced weight and increased apoptosis compared to those treated with CBD or DOX alone. Overall, our studies for the first time revealed that TRPV2 might be a good prognostic marker for TNBC and ERβ- breast cancer patient especially for those who are treated with chemotherapy. In addition, TRPV2 activation could be a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance the uptake and efficacy of chemotherapy in TNBC patients."

Targeting the murine double minute 2 (Mdm2) protein is an attractive approach, as Mdm2 levels are elevated in many therapy-refractive breast cancers. The Mdm2 protein–protein interaction inhibitor Nutlin-3a blocks the binding of Mdm2 to key signaling molecules such as p53 and p73α and can result in activation of cell death signaling pathways. In the present study, the therapeutic potential of carboplatin and Nutlin-3a to treat TNBC was investigated, as carboplatin is under evaluation in clinical trials for TNBC. In mutant p53 TMD231 TNBC cells, carboplatin and Nutlin-3a led to increased Mdm2 and was strongly synergistic in promoting cell death in vitro. Furthermore, sensitivity of TNBC cells to combination treatment was dependent on p73α. Following combination treatment, γH2AX increased and Mdm2 localized to a larger degree to chromatin compared with single-agent treatment, consistent with previous observations that Mdm2 binds to the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex associated with DNA and inhibits the DNA damage response. In vivo efficacy studies were conducted in the TMD231 orthotopic mammary fat pad model in NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice. Using an intermittent dosing schedule of combined carboplatin and Nutlin-3a, there was a significant reduction in primary tumor growth and lung metastases compared with vehicle and single-agent treatments. In addition, there was minimal toxicity to the bone marrow and normal tissues. These studies demonstrate that Mdm2 holds promise as a therapeutic target in combination with conventional therapy and may lead to new clinical therapies for TNBC.

ONC201 has a safety profile and is currently in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of various malignancies. In the current study, we examine the effect of ONC201 on triple-negative breast cancer cells (TNBC), a subtype of breast cancer that is sensitive to TRAIL. We find that ONC201 inhibits the growth of TNBC cells including TNBC cells that have developed acquired TRAIL resistance. However, TNBC cells that have developed acquired ONC201 resistance are cross-resistant to TRAIL. Mechanistically, ONC201 triggers an integrated stress response (ISR) involving the activation of the transcription factor ATF4. Knockdown of ATF4 impairs ONC201-induced apoptosis of TNBC cells. Importantly, the activation of ATF4 is compromised in ONC201-resistant TNBC cells. Thus, our results indicate that ONC201 induces an ISR to cause TNBC cell death and suggest that TNBC patients may benefit from ONC201-based therapies."

The in vitro anti-proliferative, anti-invasive, pro-apoptotic and inhibitory effects on BCSC self-renewal of these signaling pathway inhibitors on the TNBC stem cell line HCC38 were examined by MTT assays, Matrigel invasion assays, flow cytometry and suspension mammosphere assays, respectively. For the in vivo study, another TNBC stem cell line, HCC1806, pretreated with these signaling pathway inhibitors, was inoculated into female nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice, and the tumor volumes were measured following tumor formation. Treatment of HCC38 cells with each signaling pathway inhibitor significantly decreased TNBC cell proliferation, cell invasion and mammosphere formation while inducing cell apoptosis by inhibiting the protein expression or phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules. In the xenograft mouse models, tumor formation and growth of HCC1806 cells pretreated with each signaling pathway inhibitor were effectively suppressed. Treatment with these signaling pathway inhibitors may provide a novel therapeutic strategy against TNBC by targeting BCSCs, thus providing promising insight for clinical applications in patients with TNBC."

However, the kinase cascades might be activated after chemotherapy in TNBC. Here we aimed to predict whether ERK pathway targeting therapy could be used as an adjuvant therapy in TNBC. Methods Within online GEO datasets (GSE43816 and GSE54326), gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to detect molecular changes in epirubicin treated TNBC samples and cells, ERK pathway components and regulation genes changes were included. Results In epirubicin treated TNBC samples and cells, we found ERK pathway components (eg. MAPK13, MAP3K1, MAPK12, MAPK11 and MAPKAPK3) were obviously enriched, also, expression of ERK pathway positive regulation genes significantly increased (P<0.05) and negative regulation genes decreased (P<0.05) in epirubicin resistant cells. Moreover, phosphorylated ERK levels were significantly elevated in MDA-MB-231 cells after epirubicin treatment. Conclusion ERK signaling pathway was more activated in epirubicin treated TNBC, possibly contributing to the epirubicin resistance in TNBC, it implicated that ERK pathway could be used as an novel candidate for targeting therapy in refractory and relapse TNBC."

However, the insensitivity of TNBC cells to Taxol greatly limits the anticancer effect of the drug and leads to patient mortality. The present study first evaluated the expression levels of microRNA (miR)-1207-5p in human normal breast epithelial MCF-10A cells and TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436 and MDA-MB-453). The results revealed that the highest miR-1207-5p level was in MDA-MB-231, which suggested an oncogenic role of miR-1207-5p in TNBC. Therefore, MDA-MB-231 served as the present study's research model in subsequent experiments. The mRNAs that functioned as tumor suppressor factors for miR-1207-5p were then determined. Leucine zipper tumor suppressor gene 1 (LZTS1), which was predicted by TargetScan 6.2 and was supported by the results of a dual luciferase assay, was identified as a target of miR-1207-5p. AntagomiR-1207-5p increased LZTS1 mRNA and protein expressions, enhanced cell growth arrest and cell apoptosis induced by Taxol in MDA-MB-231 cells. Additionally, it was observed that, when compared with Taxol treatment, the combination of Taxol and antagomiR-1207-5p induced a sharp decrease in B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and phosphorylated-protein kinase B expression accompanied by an increase in the Bcl-2-associated X protein expression. Finally, miR-1207-5p expression was significantly increased, while LZTS1 expression was significantly decreased, in TNBC tissues when compared with normal adjacent tissues, and there was a negative correlation between miR-1207-5p and LZTS1 expression. In addition, there was a notable elevation in the expression of miR-1207-5p and a reduction in the expression of LZTS1 in the Taxol non-responsive TNBC tissues when compared with the Taxol-responsive TNBC tissues. The results of the present study suggested that miR-1207-5p may be a promising predictor of sensitivity towards Taxol in TNBC."

Currently, no targeted treatment has been approved for TNBC. The goal of this study was to design a remotely triggered, targeted therapy for TNBC using polymeric nanoparticles and light. Active targeting of TNBC was achieved by conjugating the nanoparticles to a peptide (hTf) that binds to the transferrin receptor, which is overexpressed in TNBC. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) was explored for TNBC treatment by remotely triggering benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid (BPD), a photosensitizer, using near‐infrared light. In this study, we investigated the use of actively targeting polymeric nanoparticles for PDT against TNBC using in vitro imaging and cytotoxicity studies. Fluorescence imaging confirmed that the BPD‐loaded nanoparticles showed greater fluorescence in TNBC cells compared to free BPD, but more importantly, actively targeted nanoparticles displayed stronger fluorescence compared to passively targeted nanoparticles. Moreover, fluorescence imaging following competition with empty targeted nanoparticles validated the specificity of the targeted nanoparticles for TNBC cells. The PDT killing results were in line with the fluorescence imaging results, where actively targeting nanoparticles exhibited the highest phototriggered cytotoxicity in TNBC cells, making them an attractive nanoplatform for TNBC treatment."

So far, no molecularly targeted therapeutic agents have been clinically approved for TNBC. It is imperative that we discover new targets for TNBC therapy. Objectives:A large volume of cancer genomics data are emerging and advancing breast cancer research. We may integrate different types of TNBC genomic data to discover molecular targets for TNBC therapy. Data sources:We used publicly available TNBC tumor tissue genomic data in the Cancer Genome Atlas database in this study. Methods:We integratively explored genomic profiles (gene expression, copy number, methylation, microRNA [miRNA], and gene mutation) in TNBC and identified hyperactivated genes that have higher expression, more copy numbers, lower methylation level, or are targets of miRNAs with lower expression in TNBC than in normal samples. We ranked the hyperactivated genes into different levels based on all the genomic evidence and performed functional analyses of the sets of genes identified. More importantly, we proposed potential molecular targets for TNBC therapy based on the hyperactivated genes. Results:Some of the genes we identified such as FGFR2, MAPK13, TP53, SRC family, MUC family, and BCL2 family have been suggested to be potential targets for TNBC treatment. Others such as CSF1R, EPHB3, TRIB1, and LAD1 could be promising new targets for TNBC treatment. By utilizing this integrative analysis of genomic profiles for TNBC, we hypothesized that some of the targeted treatment strategies for TNBC currently in development are more likely to be promising, such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, while the others are more likely to be discouraging, such as angiogenesis inhibitors. Limitations:The findings in this study need to be experimentally validated in the future. Conclusion:This is a systematic study that combined 5 different types of genomic data to molecularly characterize TNBC and identify potential targets for TNBC therapy. The integrative analysis of genomic profiles for TNBC could assist in identifying potential new therapeutic targets and predicting the effectiveness of a targeted treatment strategy for TNBC therapy."

The retinoblastoma (RB1) tumor suppressor is frequently lost in human TNBC. Knockdown of RB1 in luminal BC cells was shown to affect response to endocrine, radiation and several antineoplastic drugs. However, the effect of RB1 status on radiation and chemo-sensitivity in TNBC cells and whether RB1 status affects response to divergent or specific treatment are unknown. Using multiple basal-like and claudin-low cell lines, we hereby demonstrate that RB-negative TNBC cell lines are highly sensitive to gamma-irradiation, and moderately more sensitive to doxorubicin and methotrexate compared to RB-positive TNBC cell lines. In contrast, RB1 status did not affect sensitivity of TNBC cells to multiple other drugs including cisplatin (CDDP), 5-fluorouracil, idarubicin, epirubicin, PRIMA-1met, fludarabine and PD-0332991, some of which are used to treat TNBC patients. Moreover, a non-biased screen of ∼3400 compounds, including FDA-approved drugs, revealed similar sensitivity of RB-proficient and -deficient TNBC cells. Finally, ESA+/CD24−/low/CD44+ cancer stem cells from RB-negative TNBC lines were consistently more sensitive to gamma-irradiation than RB-positive lines, whereas the effect of chemotherapy on the cancer stem cell fraction varied irrespective of RB1 expression. Our results suggest that patients carrying RB-deficient TNBCs would benefit from gamma-irradiation as well as doxorubicin and methotrexate therapy, but not necessarily from many other anti-neoplastic drugs."

Here, we show that p38γ activation promotes TNBC development and progression by stimulating cancer stem‐like cell (CSC) expansion and may serve as a novel therapeutic target. p38γ silencing in TNBC cells reduces mammosphere formation and decreases expression levels of CSC drivers including Nanog, Oct3/4, and Sox2. Moreover, p38γ MAPK‐forced expression alone is sufficient to stimulate CSC expansion and to induce epithelial cell transformation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, p38γ depends on its activity to stimulate CSC expansion and breast cancer progression, indicating a therapeutic opportunity by application of its pharmacological inhibitor. Indeed, the non‐toxic p38γ specific pharmacological inhibitor pirfenidone selectively inhibits TNBC growth in vitro and/or in vivo and significantly decreases the CSC population. Mechanistically, p38γ stimulates Nanog transcription through c‐Jun/AP‐1 via a multi‐protein complex formation. These results together demonstrate that p38γ can drive TNBC development and progression and may be a novel therapeutic target for TNBC by stimulating CSC expansion. Inhibiting p38γ activity with pirfenidone may be a novel strategy for the treatment of TNBC. Stem Cells 2015;33:2738—2747"
Depletion of SENP1 suppresses the proliferation and invasion of triple-negative breast cancer cells.,"[{'authorId': '50218127', 'name': 'Zhonghua Wang'}, {'authorId': '143680684', 'name': 'Jia Jin'}, {'authorId': '2151809697', 'name': 'Jian Zhang'}, {'authorId': '3660713', 'name': 'Leiping Wang'}, {'authorId': '2217208570', 'name': 'Jun Cao'}]",30,2016,50212c0e33a625ddecf698827ecc7409c9ae7bbb,"To investigate the roles of SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), we detected the expression level of SENP1 in the clinical samples of TNBC and non‑TNBC patients by using immunohistochemical staining, qRT‑PCR, and western blotting. We found that SENP1 was highly expressed in the TNBC tissues compared with the normal breast tissues, as well as non‑TNBC tissues. Next, we constructed the si‑SENP1‑transfected TNBC cell lines for further biological function investigation. Then a xenograft model of nude mice was constructed to confirm the roles of SENP1 in TNBC formation and metastasis. According to our results, deficiency of SENP1 significantly represses the proliferation, invasion, migration, and colony formation of TNBC cells through blocking the cell cycle and regulating the expression of cyclin‑dependent kinases (CDKs) p21 and p27, as well as MMP9. Furthermore, in vivo experiments revealed that depletion of SENP1 remarkably inhibits the tumor volume, lung metastatis and the expression of p21, p27, MMP9, and Ki67. Taken together, this study elucidated that SENP1 is essential for TNBC cell proliferation and migration in vitro, as well as tumor formation and metastasis in vivo, indicating that SENP1 is a potential therapeutic target for TNBC treatment."

Thus, the development of alternative therapeutic strategies for TNBC is essential. The purpose of our in vitro study was to evaluate the impact of p53 gene silencing in conjunction with the administration of a natural compound, epigallocatechingallate (EGCG). RT2Profiler PCR Array technology was used to evaluate the impact of dual treatment on the main genes involved in apoptosis in the Hs578T cell culture model of TNBC. Gene expression analysis revealed 28 genes were significantly altered (16 upregulated and 12 downregulated) in response to combined p53 siRNA and EGCG treatment. Further analysis revealed that p53 siRNA and EGCG dual therapy leads to the activation of pro-apoptotic genes and the inhibition of pro-survival genes, autophagy, and cell network formation. These results indicate that this dual therapy targets both the apoptotic and angiogenic pathways, which may improve treatment effectiveness for tumors resistant to conventional treatment."

Here, we performed an in-depth molecular analysis of a mouse model that establishes spontaneous lung metastasis from JygMC(A) cells. These primary tumors resembled the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) both phenotypically and molecularly. Morphologically, primary tumors presented both epithelial and spindle-like cells but displayed only adenocarcinoma-like features in lung parenchyma. The use of laser-capture microdissection combined with Nanostring mRNA and microRNA analysis revealed overexpression of either epithelial and miRNA-200 family or mesenchymal markers in adenocarcinoma and mesenchymal regions, respectively. Cripto-1, an embryonic stem cell marker, was present in spindle-like areas and its promoter showed activity in primary tumors. Cripto-1 knockout by the CRISPR-Cas9 system inhibited tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis. Our findings show characterization of a novel mouse model that mimics the TNBC and reveal Cripto-1 as a TNBC target hence may offer alternative treatment strategies for TNBC."

Chemotherapy is the traditional standard-of-care for TNBC, but is frequently accompanied by severe side effects. Despite the fact that high expression of steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC–3) is correlated with poor survival in estrogen receptor positive breast cancer patients, its role in TNBC has not been extensively investigated. Here, we show that high expression of SRC–3 correlates with both poor overall survival and post progression survival in TNBC patients, suggesting that SRC–3 can serve as a prognostic marker for TNBC. Furthermore, we demonstrated that bufalin, a SRC–3 small molecule inhibitor, when introduced even at nM concentrations, can significantly reduce TNBC cell viability and motility. However, because bufalin has minimal water solubility, its in vivo application is limited. Therefore, we developed a water soluble prodrug, 3-phospho-bufalin, to facilitate its in vivo administration. In addition, we demonstrated that 3-phospho-bufalin can effectively inhibit tumor growth in an orthotopic TNBC mouse model, suggesting its potential application as a targeted therapy for TNBC treatment."

In the present study, 122 TNBC patients were subjected to analysis of Aurora-A (Aur-A) expression and survival prognosis. We found that Aur-A high expression was positively associated with initial clinical stage (P = 0.025), the proliferation marker Ki-67 (P = 0.001), and the recurrence rate of TNBC patients (P<0.001). In TNBC patients with Aur-A high expression, the risk of distant recurrence peaked at the first 3 years and declined rapidly thereafter, whereas patients with Aur-A low expression showed a relatively constant risk of recurrence during the entire follow-up period. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that overexpression of Aur-A predicted poor overall survival (P = 0.002) and progression-free survival (P = 0.012) in TNBC. Furthermore, overexpression of Aur-A, associated with high Ki-67, predicted an inferior prognosis compared with low expression of both Aur-A and Ki-67. Importantly, we further found that Aur-A was overexpressed in TNBC cells, and inhibition of this kinase inhibited cell proliferation and prevented cell migration in TNBC. Our findings demonstrated that Aur-A was a potential therapeutic target for TNBC and inhibition of Aur-A kinase was a promising regimen for TNBC cancer therapy."

Until now, clinical trials for TNBCs using EGFR inhibitors (EGFRis) as single agents have yielded disappointing results. Here, we report that combinatorial treatment using EGFRis, such as gefitinib or erlotinib, with PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors (PI3K/AKTis) demonstrated a synergistic, anti‐proliferative effect in cell lines of the basal‐like (BL) subtype, a subtype of TNBC. Western blot analysis revealed that the gefitinib/PI‐103 combination significantly reduced the level of both phospho‐AKT and phospho‐ERK in two susceptible BL subtype cell lines, SUM149PT and MDA‐MB‐468, whereas it had little or no effect on the level of phospho‐ERK in two non‐susceptible cell lines (HS578T and MDA‐MB‐231) of mesenchymal stem‐like (MSL) TNBC subtype. The gefitinib/PI‐103 combination also significantly induced caspase‐3/7‐mediated PARP cleavage and reduced two anti‐apoptotic proteins, XIAP and Bcl‐2 in the susceptible cell lines. In addition, the level of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl‐1) protein was markedly decreased by gefitinib/PI‐103 combination in the BL TNBC cells, but showed no significant change by this combination in MSL subtype cells. These results suggest that pharmacological inhibition of EGFR used in combination of PI3K/AKTis is a potential therapeutic approach to treat a subtype of TNBCs."

In the present study, the expression levels of miR‑200c in patients with TNBC were analyzed and it was identified that miR‑200c was downregulated in TNBC samples, compared with that in normal adjacent tissues. miR‑200c was overexpressed in the TNBC cell line MDA‑MB‑231 and its functions were studied in vitro and in vivo. An in vitro study revealed that the overexpression of miR‑200c inhibited MDA‑MB‑231 cell proliferation and resulted in the induction of apoptosis. The in vivo data indicated that the overexpression of miR‑200c significantly inhibited tumor growth and increased the rate of apoptosis. Target prediction revealed that the X‑linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) had putative complementary sequences to miR‑200c, which was confirmed by a dual luciferase reporter assay. Western blot analysis further demonstrated that the expression of XIAP was markedly reduced and that caspase‑3 was highly activated by the overexpression of miR‑200c. These findings suggested that miR‑200c may function as a tumor suppressor gene in TNBC, at least partly via directly targeting XIAP, and may therefore act as a potential therapeutic target in the development of novel treatment strategies for TNBC."

Here, we determined the in vitro and in vivo activity of the combination of the pan-HDI panobinostat and the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine against human estrogen/progesterone receptor and HER2 (triple)-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Treatment of MB-231 and SUM159PT cells with panobinostat disrupted the hsp90/histone deacetylase 6/HSF1/p97 complex, resulting in the upregulation of hsp. This was accompanied by the induction of enhanced autophagic flux as evidenced by increased expression of LC3B-II and the degradation of the autophagic substrate p62. Treatment with panobinostat also induced the accumulation and colocalization of p62 with LC3B-II in cytosolic foci as evidenced by immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. Inhibition of panobinostat-induced autophagic flux by chloroquine markedly induced the accumulation of polyubiquitylated proteins and p62, caused synergistic cell death of MB-231 and SUM159PT cells, and inhibited mammosphere formation in MB-231 cells, compared with treatment with each agent alone. Finally, in mouse mammary fat pad xenografts of MB-231 cells, a tumor size–dependent induction of heat shock response, ER stress and autophagy were observed. Cotreatment with panobinostat and chloroquine resulted in reduced tumor burden and increased the survival of MB-231 breast cancer xenografts. Collectively, our findings show that cotreatment with an autophagy inhibitor and pan-HDI, for example, chloroquine and panobinostat results in accumulation of toxic polyubiquitylated proteins, exerts superior inhibitory effects on TNBC cell growth, and increases the survival of TNBC xenografts.

Aberrant epigenetics in this subtype represent a potential therapeutic opportunity, but a better understanding of the mechanisms contributing to the TNBC pathogenesis is required. The SIN3 molecular scaffold performs a critical role in multiple cellular processes, including epigenetic regulation, and has been identified as a potential therapeutic target. Using a competitive peptide corresponding to the SIN3 interaction domain of MAD (Tat-SID), we investigated the functional consequences of selectively blocking the paired amphipathic α-helix (PAH2) domain of SIN3. Here, we report the identification of the SID-containing adaptor PF1 as a factor required for maintenance of the TNBC stem cell phenotype and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Tat-SID peptide blocked the interaction between SIN3A and PF1, leading to epigenetic modulation and transcriptional downregulation of TNBC stem cell and EMT markers. Importantly, Tat-SID treatment also led to a reduction in primary tumor growth and disseminated metastatic disease in vivo. In support of these findings, knockdown of PF1 expression phenocopied treatment with Tat-SID both in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate a critical role for a complex containing SIN3A and PF1 in TNBC and provide a rational for its therapeutic targeting."

This review discusses the natural history of TNBC and published literature in the relevant treatment landscape, with a focus on newer therapies. Compared with other subtypes of breast cancer, TN tumors have higher response rates to neoadjuvant chemotherapy; however, this advantage is not clearly translated into the metastatic setting and has not improved these patients’ overall survival. Numerous cytotoxic and targeted strategies have demonstrated efficacy or are under investigation. Strategies showing promise in this difficult‐to‐treat group of patients include cytotoxic therapy with platinum‐containing agents, ixabepilone, and novel targeted approaches such as poly(ADP‐ribose) polymerase inhibitors."

In this study, we used EGFR as a target for radioimmunotherapy and hypothesized that EGFR-directed radioimmunotherapy can deliver a continuous lethal radiation dose to residual tumors that are radiosensitized by PARP inhibitors and chemotherapy. Methods: We analyzed EGFR messenger RNA in published gene expression array studies and investigated EGFR protein expression by immunohistochemistry in a cohort of breast cancer patients to confirm EGFR as a target in TNBC. Preclinically, using orthotopic and metastatic xenograft models of EGFR-positive TNBC, we investigated the effect of the novel combination of 177Lu-labeled anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, chemotherapy, and PARP inhibitors on cell death and the survival of breast cancer stem cells. Results: In this first preclinical study of anti-EGFR radioimmunotherapy in breast cancer, we found that anti-EGFR radioimmunotherapy is safe and that TNBC orthotopic tumors and established metastases were eradicated in mice treated with anti-EGFR radioimmunotherapy combined with chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors. We showed that the superior response to this triple-agent combination therapy was associated with apoptosis and eradication of putative breast cancer stem cells. Conclusion: Our data support further preclinical investigations toward the development of combination therapies using systemic anti-EGFR radioimmunotherapy for the treatment of recurrent and metastatic TNBC."

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) may be more sensitive to platinum. This study was to compare platinum-based regimen with nonplatinum regimen in the first-line treatment of advanced TNBC.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Eligible metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) women without prior treatment for advanced disease were randomized (1 : 1) to receive either docetaxel-cisplatin (TP) or docetaxel -capecitabine (TX) q3w for up to 6 cycles, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) and the secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). In total 53 patients were enrolled.


RESULTS
The median follow-up was 24 months. ORR was higher in the TP group than in the TX group (63.0% versus 15.4%, P = 0.001). PFS was more than doubled (10.9 months versus 4.8 months, P < 0.001) and median OS was also greatly improved (32.8 months versus 21.5 months, P = 0.027). Toxic effects were not different except G3/4 vomiting and G2/3 hand-foot syndrome.


CONCLUSIONS
This study suggested that cisplatin-based chemotherapy was superior to capecitabine-based regimen in the first-line treatment of mTNBC, as measured by ORR, PFS and OS. Further large-scale study should be warranted. These results are not sufficient to change clinical practice."

Chemotherapy of TNBC relies on anti‐cancer agents with strong cytotoxicity, but it causes several side effects with recurrence. While combinational approaches of chemotherapeutics have been highlighted as a new treatment strategy for TNBC to reduce side effects, combinations of anti‐cancer agents with herbal medicines have not been reported. We recently reported that newly modified traditional Chinese medicine named SH003 inhibited TNBC growth. Considering a combinational strategy for TNBC treatment, we further studied synergistic effects of SH003 with various anti‐cancer drugs in TNBC treatment. Here, we demonstrate that SH003 shows a synergistic effect with doxorubicin on TNBC treatment. Our in vitro cell viability assays revealed that SH003 and doxorubicin showed a synergistic effect in the well‐defined TNBC cell line, MDA‐MB‐231. Moreover, we found that the combinational treatment caused Caspase‐dependent apoptotic cell death. Our in vivo mouse xenograft tumor growth assays confirmed that combinational treatment of SH003 with doxorubicin repressed MDA‐MB‐231 tumor growth with no weight loss. Therefore, we conclude that the combinational treatment of SH003 with doxorubicin shows the synergism in TNBC treatment, and suggest that SH003 can be used together with conventional anti‐cancer drugs in chemotherapeutic approaches.

The loss of tumor suppressor gene PTEN is the most common first event associated with basal-like subtype (Martins, De, Almendro, Gonen, and Park, 2012). Here we report for the first time that the functional upregulation of secreted-MMP7, a transcriptional target of Wnt-β-catenin signature pathway in TNBC is associated to the loss of PTEN. We identified differential expression of mRNAs in several key-components genes, and transcriptional target genes of the Wnt-β-catenin pathway (WP), including beta-catenin, FZD7, DVL1, MMP7, c-MYC, BIRC5, CD44, PPARD, c-MET, and NOTCH1 in FFPE tumors samples from TNBC patients of two independent cohorts. A similar differential upregulation of mRNA/protein for beta-catenin, the functional readout of WP, and for MMP7, a transcriptional target gene of beta-catenin was observed in TNBC cell line models. Genetic or pharmacological attenuation of beta-catenin by SiRNA or WP modulators (XAV939 and sulindac sulfide) and pharmacological mimicking of PTEN following LY294002 treatment downregulated MMP7 levels as well as enzymatic function of the secreted MMP7 in MMP7 positive PTEN-null TNBC cells. Patient data revealed that MMP7 mRNA was high in only a subpopulation of TNBC, and this subpopulation was characterized by a concurrent low expression of PTEN mRNA. In cell lines, a high expression of casein-zymograph-positive MMP7 was distinguished by an absence of functional PTEN. A similar inverse relationship between MMP7 and PTEN mRNA levels was observed in the PAM50 data set (a correlation coefficient of -0.54). The PAM50 subtype and outcome data revealed that the high MMP7 group had low pCR (25%) and High Rd (74%) in clinical stage T3 pathologic response in contrast to the high pCR (40%) and low residual disease (RD) (60%) of the low MMP7 group."

Dual-target murine double minute 2 (MDM2) and murine double minute X (MDMX) inhibitor has been proved to play a critical part against cancer, particularly focusing on the tremendous potential to enhance the efficacy of doxorubicin (DOX), however little was reported in TNBC. In the present study, we investigated the synergistic antitumor effect of the MDM2/MDMX inhibitor with DOX using three TNBC cell lines, two in situ transplantation tumor models and 214 clinical samples. We observed that the MDM2/MDMX inhibitor combined with DOX could not only inhibit cell vitality and migration and invasion abilities, but also highly inhibit tumor growth in TNBC nude mice. Besides, co-treatment of MDM2/MDMX inhibitor and DOX suppressed epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) through increasing the TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1), transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) expression. Small interfering RNA-mediated TAB1 knockdown induced the EMT, desensitized cells to DOX and enhanced the migration and invasion abilities. High MDM2/MDMX expression was positively associated with weak TAB1 expression in 214 TNBC tumor tissues confirmed by immumohistochemical staining and MDM2/MDMX/TAB1 expression was significantly related to TNBC patient survival. These findings indicate that dual-target MDM2/MDMX inhibitor could increase the sensitization of doxorubicin and inhibit migration and invasion abilities in TNBC cells through p38 MAPK pathway activation caused EMT suppression and hence could be useful in TNBC treatments in future."

Strikingly, a high percentage of TNBCs overexpresses the EGF receptor (EGFR), yet EGFR inhibition has yielded little clinical benefit. Over the last decade, advances in EGFR biology have established that EGFR functions in two distinct signaling pathways: (i) classical membrane-bound signaling and (ii) nuclear signaling. Previous studies have demonstrated that nuclear EGFR (nEGFR) can enhance resistance to anti-EGFR therapies and is correlated with poor overall survival in breast cancer. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that nEGFR may promote intrinsic resistance to cetuximab in TNBC. To examine this question, a battery of TNBC cell lines and human tumors were screened and found to express nEGFR. Knockdown of EGFR expression demonstrated that TNBC cell lines retained dependency on EGFR for proliferation, yet all cell lines were resistant to cetuximab. Furthermore, Src Family Kinases (SFKs) influenced nEGFR translocation in TNBC cell lines and in vivo tumor models, where inhibition of SFK activity led to potent reductions in nEGFR expression. Inhibition of nEGFR translocation led to a subsequent accumulation of EGFR on the plasma membrane, which greatly enhanced sensitivity of TNBC cells to cetuximab. Collectively, these data suggest that targeting both the nEGFR signaling pathway, through the inhibition of its nuclear transport, and the classical EGFR signaling pathway with cetuximab may be a viable approach for the treatment of patients with TNBC.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by the lack of expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2, is typically associated with a poor prognosis. The majority of TNBCs show the expression of basal markers on gene expression profiling and most authors accept TNBC as basal-like (BL) breast cancer. However, a smaller fraction lacks a BL phenotype despite being TNBC. The literature is silent on non-basal-like (NBL) type of TNBC. The present study was aimed at defining behavioral differences between BL and NBL phenotypes.


OBJECTIVES
i) Identify the TNBCs and categorize them into BL and NBL breast cancer. ii) Examine the behavioral differences between two subtypes. iii) Observe the pattern of treatment failure among TNBCs.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
All TNBC cases during January 2009-December 2010 were retrieved. The subjects fitting the inclusion criteria of study were differentiated into BL and NBL phenotypes using surrogate immunohistochemistry with three basal markers 34βE12, c-Kit and EGFR as per the algorithm defined by Nielsen et al. The detailed data of subjects were collated from clinical records. The comparison of clinicopathological features between two subgroups was done using statistical analyses. The pattern of treatment failure along with its association with prognostic factors was assessed.


RESULTS
TNBC constituted 18% of breast cancer cases considered in the study. The BL and NBL subtypes accounted for 81% and 19% respectively of the TNBC group. No statistically significant association was seen between prognostic parameters and two phenotypes. Among patients with treatment failure, 19% were with BL and 15% were with NBL phenotype. The mean disease free survival (DFS) in groups BL and NBL was 30.0 and 37.9 months respectively, while mean overall survival (OS) was 31.93 and 38.5 months respectively. Treatment failure was significantly associated with stage (p=.023) among prognostic factors.


CONCLUSIONS
Disease stage at presentation is an important prognostic factor influencing the treatment failure and survival among TNBCs. Increasing tumor size is related to lymph node positivity. BL tumors have a more aggressive clinical course than that of NBL as shown by shorter DFS and OS, despite having no statistically significant difference between prognostic parameters. New therapeutic alternatives should be explored for patients with this subtype of breast cancer."

In this study, MCF-7 (an estrogen receptor-positive human breast cancer cell line), MDA-MB-231 (a human TNBC cell line) and 4T1 (a mouse TNBC cell line) were used to investigate the anti-cancer effects of ionizing radiation (IR) combined with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC)) and to determine the underlying mechanisms of these effects in vitro and in vivo. We also evaluated the ability of SAHA to inhibit the metastasis of 4T1 cells. We found that IR combined with SAHA showed increased therapeutic efficacy when compared with either treatment alone in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells. Moreover, the combined treatment enhanced DNA damage through the inhibition of DNA repair proteins. The combined treatment was induced primarily through autophagy and ER stress. In an orthotopic breast cancer mouse model, the combination treatment showed a greater inhibition of tumor growth. In addition, SAHA inhibited the migration and invasion abilities of 4T1 cells and inhibited breast cancer cell migration by inhibiting the activity of MMP-9. In an in vivo experimental metastasis mouse model, SAHA significantly inhibited lung metastasis. SAHA not only enhances radiosensitivity but also suppresses lung metastasis in breast cancer. These novel findings suggest that SAHA alone or combined with IR could serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for breast cancer."

Our results illustrated that doxorubicin triggered EMT and resulted in the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype in TNBC cells. Moreover, we found that transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways were acquired for doxorubicin-induced EMT. Interestingly, we found that curcumin suppressed doxorubicin-induced EMT. Curcumin reversed doxorubicin-induced morphological changes, inhibited doxorubicin-induced downregulation of E-cadherin expressions, and inhibited doxorubicin-induced upregulation of vimentin expression. We also found that curcumin inhibited doxorubicin-induced EMT by inhibiting the TGF-β and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Moreover, curcumin enhanced the antiproliferative effects of doxorubicin in TNBC cells.

Notch signaling has been implicated in breast cancer but the factors that control Notch in TNBC are unknown. Because the Vacuolar ATPase has been shown to be important in breast cancer invasiveness, we investigated the role of a2-subunit isoform of Vacuolar ATPase (a2V) in regulating Notch signaling in TNBC. Confocal microscopy revealed that among all the ‘a’ subunit isoforms, a2V was uniquely expressed on the plasma membrane of breast cancer cells. Both a2V and NOTCH1 were elevated in TNBC tumors tissues and cell lines. a2V knockdown by siRNA as well as V-ATPase inhibition by Bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1) in TNBC cell lines enhanced Notch signaling by increasing the expression of Notch1 intracellular Domain (N1ICD). V-ATPase inhibition blocked NICD degradation by disrupting autophagy and lysosomal acidification as demonstrated by accumulation of LC3B and diminished expression of LAMP1 respectively. Importantly, treatment with Baf A1 or anti-a2V, a novel-neutralizing antibody against a2V hindered cell migration of TNBC cells. Our findings indicate that a2V regulates Notch signaling through its role in endolysosomal acidification and emerges as a potential target for TNBC."

In order for CD44 to be induced, YB‐1 must be phosphorylated at S102 by p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK). We therefore questioned whether RSK might be a tractable molecular target to eliminate TICs. In support of this idea, injection of MDA‐MB‐231 cells expressing Flag‐YB‐1 into mice increased tumor growth as well as enhanced CD44 expression. Despite enrichment for TICs, these cells were sensitive to RSK inhibition when treated ex vivo with BI‐D1870. Targeting RSK2 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) or small molecule RSK kinase inhibitors (SL0101 and BI‐D1870) blocked TNBC monolayer cell growth by ∼100%. In a diverse panel of breast tumor cell line models RSK2 siRNA predominantly targeted models of TNBC. RSK2 inhibition decreased CD44 promoter activity, CD44 mRNA, protein expression, and mammosphere formation. CD44+ cells had higher P‐RSKS221/227, P‐YB‐1S102, and mitotic activity relative to CD44− cells. Importantly, RSK2 inhibition specifically suppressed the growth of TICs and triggered cell death. Moreover, silencing RSK2 delayed tumor initiation in mice. In patients, RSK2 mRNA was associated with poor disease‐free survival in a cohort of 244 women with breast cancer that had not received adjuvant treatment, and its expression was highest in the basal‐like breast cancer subtype. Taking this further, we report that P‐RSKS221/227 is present in primary TNBCs and correlates with P‐YB‐1S102 as well as CD44. In conclusion, RSK2 inhibition provides a novel therapeutic avenue for TNBC and holds the promise of eliminating TICs. STEM CELLS2012;30:1338–1348"

It is highly heterogeneous and exhibits considerable overlap with basal-like and BRCA-related breast cancers. Constituting 15–20% of breast cancers, TNBC exhibits an aggressive phenotype with a poor prognosis. This review summarizes recent progress and studies in TNBC and discusses some of the ongoing clinical trials and emerging therapies for the treatment of TNBC. Recent findings Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy and DNA damaging agents continue to be the mainstay for treatment of this disease. The use of targeted agents such as bevacizumab, epidermal growth factor receptor and polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitors have led to conflicting results. However, recent research has prompted evaluation of additional drugs targeting multiple signaling pathways and epigenetic modifications for the treatment of this disease. Summary TNBC remains a challenging disease to treat with recent trials having demonstrated only modest improvements in outcomes. Increased understanding of the heterogeneity of this complex subtype may help tailor therapies to specific patient subgroups."

Here, we undertook a comprehensive evaluation of the activity of ganetespib, a potent inhibitor of HSP90, in this malignancy. Experimental Design: The antitumor and antimetastatic activity of ganetespib was investigated using TNBC cell lines and xenograft models. Combinatorial drug analyses were performed with chemotherapeutic agents and concomitant effects on DNA damage and cell-cycle disruption were assessed in vitro; antitumor efficacy was assessed in vivo. Metabolic and objective tumor responses were evaluated in patients with metastatic TNBC undergoing ganetespib treatment. Results: Ganetespib simultaneously deactivated multiple oncogenic pathways to potently reduce cell viability in TNBC cell lines, and suppressed lung metastases in experimental models. Ganetespib potentiated the cytotoxic activity of doxorubicin via enhanced DNA damage and mitotic arrest, conferring superior efficacy to the doxorubicin–cyclophosphamide regimen in TNBC xenografts. Ganetespib also promoted mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis in combination with taxanes in vitro, and these effects translated to significantly improved combinatorial activity in vivo. Marked tumor shrinkage of metastatic lung and lymphatic lesions were seen in patients on ganetespib monotherapy. Conclusion: The preclinical activity profile and clinical evidence of tumor regression suggest that ganetespib offers considerable promise as a new therapeutic candidate to target TNBC.

To identify the mechanism by which residual cancer cells survive chemotherapy, we initially conducted gene expression profiling using the CRL2335 TNBC cell line derived from a squamous breast carcinoma before and after treatment with cisplatin plus TRAIL. We found a significant increase in the expression of FZD8, one of Wnt receptors, and its downstream targets LEF1 and TCF in residual CRL2335 tumor cells after treatment with cisplatin plus TRAIL. Increased FZD8 levels were further confirmed in other TNBC cell lines. Inhibition of FZD8 by siRNA in CRL2335 cells in the presence of cisplatin plus TRAIL reduced β-catenin and survivin levels and increased apoptosis compared with scrambled siRNA–treated cells. In vivo data show that cisplatin plus TRAIL treatment significantly reduces tumor volume in NOD/SCID mice. However, we found that cisplatin plus TRAIL treatment predominantly eliminated non–tumor-initiating cells, as shown by whole-body fluorescent imaging of mice injected with mammosphere-forming CRL2335 cells stably transfected with DsRed. This led to TIC enrichment in residual tumors, as confirmed by immunostaining for TIC markers. Moreover, an increase in FZD8 expression was observed in residual tumors treated with cisplatin and TRAIL. Taken together, our findings suggest that FZD8-mediated Wnt signaling may play a major role in mediating resistance to chemotherapy, making it a potential target to enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy in patients with TNBCs.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are emerging as one of the most promising “targeted” therapeutics to treat TNBC, with the intended “target” being DNA repair. PARPs are a family of enzymes involved in multiple cellular processes, including DNA repair. TNBC shares multiple clinico-pathologic features with BRCA-mutated breast cancers, which harbor dysfunctional DNA repair mechanisms. Investigators hypothesized that PARP inhibition, in conjunction with the loss of DNA repair via BRCA-dependent mechanisms, would result in synthetic lethality and augmented cell death. This hypothesis has borne out in both preclinical models and in clinical trials testing PARP inhibitors in both BRCA-deficient and triple-negative breast cancer. The focus of this review includes an overview of the preclinical rationale for evaluating PARP inhibitors in TNBC, the presumed mechanism of action of this novel therapeutic class, promising results from several influential clinical trials of PARP inhibition in advanced breast cancer (both TNBC and BRCA deficient), proposed mechanisms of acquired resistance to PARP inhibitors, and, finally, concludes with current challenges and future directions for the development of PARP inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer.

In epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant cells, both nuclear EGFR (nEGFR) expression and PCNA Y211 phosphorylation are increased. Moreover, the resistance to EGFR TKI is a major clinical problem in treating EGFR-overexpressing triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Thus, effective treatment to combat resistance is urgently needed. Here, we show that treatment of cell-penetrating PCNA peptide (CPPP) inhibits growth and induces apoptosis of human TNBC cells. The Y211F CPPP specifically targets EGFR and competes directly for PCNA tyrosine Y211 phosphorylation and prevents nEGFR from binding PCNA in vivo; it also suppresses tumor growth by sensitizing EGFR TKI resistant cells, which have enhanced nEGFR function and abrogated classical EGFR membrane signaling. Furthermore, we identify an active motif of CPPP, RFLNFF (RF6 CPPP), which is necessary and sufficient to inhibit TKI-resistant TNBC cell growth of orthotopic implanted tumor in mice. Finally, the activity of its synthetic retro-inverted derivative, D-RF6 CPPP, on an equimolar basis, is more potent than RF6 CPPP.

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease comprising of distinct biological subtypes with many targeted prognostic biomarkers having therapeutic implications. However, no specific targeted therapy for triple negative breast cancer has been discovered to date and hence further research is needed.


AIM
The aim and objectives of the present study were to examine the prevalence of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) in North-East India and to compare the clinicopathological parameters in two study groups defined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) -""TNBC"" and ""Others"".


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We carried out a retrospective study in a cohort of 972 patients diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma in the Department of Pathology, Dr. B. Borooah Cancer Institute, a Regional Cancer Centre for treatment and research, Guwahati, for a period of 3 years and 10 months from January 2010 to October 2013. Based on IHC findings, patients were divided into two groups - ""TNBC"" and ""Others"". All relevant clinicopathological parameters were compared in both. TNBC were defined as those that were estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2/neu negative while those positive for any of these markers were defined as ""Others"".


RESULTS
In this study, out of total 972 cases 31.9% (310 cases) were defined as TNBC and 662 cases (68.1%) as ""Others"" based on IHC markers. Compared to the ""Others"" category, TNBC presented at an early age (mean 40 years), were associated with high grade large tumours and high rate of node positivity, IDC NOS being the most common histological subtype in TNBC.


CONCLUSIONS
TNBC accounts for a significant portion of breast cancers in this part of India and commonly present at younger age and tend to be large high grade tumours."

Methods TNBC cells were pretreated with Noscapine or Doxorubicin or combination and combination index values were calculated using isobolographic method. Apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL staining. Female athymic Nu/nu mice were xenografted with MDA-MB-231 cells and the efficacy of Noscapine, Doxorubicin and combination was determined. Protein expression, immunohistochemical staining were evaluated in harvested tumor tissues. Results Noscapine inhibited growth of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells with the IC50 values of 36.16±3.76 and 42.7±4.3 µM respectively. The CI values (<0.59) were suggestive of strong synergistic interaction between Noscapine and Doxorubicin and combination treatment showed significant increase in apoptotic cells. Noscapine showed dose dependent reduction in the tumor volumes at a dose of 150–550 mg/kg/day compared to controls. Noscapine (300 mg/kg), Doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg) and combination treatment reduced tumor volume by 39.4±5.8, 34.2±5.7 and 82.9±4.5 percent respectively and showed decreased expression of NF-KB pathway proteins, VEGF, cell survival, and increased expression of apoptotic and growth inhibitory proteins compared to single-agent treatment and control groups. Conclusions Noscapine potentiated the anticancer activity of Doxorubicin in a synergistic manner against TNBC tumors via inactivation of NF-KB and anti-angiogenic pathways while stimulating apoptosis. These findings suggest potential benefit for use of oral Noscapine and Doxorubicin combination therapy for treatment of more aggressive TNBC."

In particular, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subset of very aggressive breast tumors, is associated with a poor prognosis and has very few efficient therapeutic options. The ectonucleotidase CD73 has recently emerged as a promising new target for TNBC in preclinical models. Pharmacological targeting of CD73 and downstream adenosine A2A/A2B receptor signaling is currently an active field of research that could lead to the development of new cancer therapeutics, including options against TNBC. Areas covered: This article reviews the basic structural and molecular features of CD73 and its role in the development of cancer, with a particular focus on CD73's role in the biology of TNBC. Expert opinion: It was recently demonstrated that CD73 expression in TNBC is associated with worse clinical outcomes and increased resistance to anthracycline chemotherapy. Targeted blockade of the CD73/A2A axis has been shown to impair various aspects of tumorigenesis and displays synergism with other anti-cancer treatments in preclinical studies. Hence, we strongly argue for the development of CD73 inhibitors and for the repositioning of A2A antagonists in cancer."

In order to analyze the clinicopathological and molecular biological characteristics and observe survival and prognostic factors, 972 breast cancer patients (156 of whom had TNBC) who received treatment at the First Affiliated Hospital of Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University and the First Hospital of China Medical University, between January, 2004 and January, 2007 were retrospectively evaluated. In the univariate analysis, tumor size, TNM stage, axillary lymph node status and recurrence or metastasis were identified as prognostic factors for 7-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Our multivariate Cox's regression analysis demonstrated that tumor size and axillary lymph node status were significant prognostic factors for 7-year DFS and OS. Notably, tumor subgroup (TNBC vs. non-TNBC) was a significant prognostic factor associated with 7-year DFS and OS in breast cancer. It was suggested that TNBC exhibited a worse 7-year survival compared with that in non-TNBC patients, most likely due to its more aggressive behavior and insensitivity to specific therapy."

This study aimed to assess the impact of BRCA1 promoter methylation with respect to breast cancer subtypes in sporadic disease. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed representing tumors from 303 patients previously screened for BRCA1 germline mutations, of which a subset of 111 sporadic tumors had previously been analyzed with respect to BRCA1 methylation. Additionally, a set of eight tumors from BRCA1 mutation carriers were included on the TMAs. Expression analysis was performed on TMAs by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for BRCA1, pRb, p16, p53, PTEN, ER, PR, HER2, CK5/6, EGFR, MUC1 and Ki-67. Data on BRCA1 aberrations and IHC expression was examined with respect to breast cancer-specific survival. The results demonstrate that CpG island hypermethylation of BRCA1 significantly associates with the basal/triple-negative subtype. Low expression of pRb, and high/intense p16, were associated with BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation, and the same effects were seen in BRCA1 mutated tumors. The expression patterns of BRCA1, pRb, p16 and PTEN were highly correlated, and define a subgroup of TNBCs characterized by BRCA1 aberrations, high Ki-67 (≥40%) and favorable disease outcome. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that epigenetic inactivation of the BRCA1 gene associates with RB/p16 dysfunction in promoting TNBCs. The clinical implications relate to the potential use of targeted treatment based on PARP inhibitors in sporadic TNBCs, wherein CpG island hypermethylation of BRCA1 represents a potential marker of therapeutic response."

TNBCs are associated with an overall poor prognosis because they lack expression of therapeutic targets like ERα and are biologically more aggressive. A second estrogen receptor, ERβ, has been found to be expressed in 50% to 90% of ERα-negative breast cancers, and ERβ expression in TNBCs has been shown to correlate with improved disease-free survival and good prognosis. To elucidate the role of ERβ in regulating gene expression and cell proliferation in TNBC cells, the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-468 was engineered with inducible expression of full-length ERβ. In culture, ERβ expression inhibited cell growth by inducing a G1 cell cycle arrest, which was further enhanced by 17β-estradiol treatment. In xenografts, ERβ expression also inhibited tumor formation and growth, and 17β-estradiol treatment resulted in rapid tumor regression. Furthermore, genomic RNA sequencing identified both ligand-dependent and -independent ERβ target genes, some of which were also regulated by ERβ in other TNBC cell lines and correlated with ERβ expression in a cohort of TNBCs from the Cancer Genome Atlas Network. ERβ target genes were enriched in genes that regulate cell death and survival, cell movement, cell development, and growth and proliferation, as well as genes involved in the Wnt/β-catenin and the G1/S cell cycle phase checkpoint pathways. In addition to confirming the anti-proliferative effects of ERβ in TNBC cells, these data provide a comprehensive resource of ERβ target genes and suggest that ERβ may be targeted with ligands that can stimulate its growth inhibitory effects."

Patients with TNBC have typical high grading, more frequent relapses, and exhibit poorer outcomes or prognosis compared with the other subtypes of breast cancers. Currently, there are no targeted therapies that are effective for TNBC. Preclinical antitumor activity of oseltamivir phosphate (OP) therapy was investigated to identify its role in tumor neovascularization, growth, invasiveness, and long-term survival in a mouse model of human TNBC. Methods Live cell sialidase, water soluble tetrazolium, WST-1 cell viability, and immunohistochemistry assays were used to evaluate sialidase activity, cell survival, and the expression levels of tumor E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and host endothelial CD31+/PECAM-1 cells in archived paraffin-embedded TNBC MDA-MB-231 tumors grown in RAGxCγ double mutant mice. Results OP, anti-Neu1 antibodies, and matrix metalloproteinase-9-specific inhibitor blocked Neu1 activity associated with EGF-stimulated TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells. OP treatment of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells and their long-term tamoxifen-resistant clones reproducibly and dose-dependently reduced the sialidase activity associated with EGF-stimulated live cells and the cell viability after 72 hours of incubation. Combination of 1 μM cisplatin, 5-FU, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, or tamoxifen with OP dosages ≥300 μg/mL significantly reduced cell viability at 24, 48, and 72 hours when compared to the chemodrug alone. Heterotopic xenografts of MDA-MB-231 tumors developed robust and bloody tumor vascularization in RAG2xCγ double mutant mice. OP treatment at 30 mg/kg daily intraperitoneally reduced tumor vascularization and growth rate as well as significantly reduced tumor weight and spread to the lungs compared with the untreated cohorts. OP treatment at 50 mg/kg completely ablated tumor vascularization, tumor growth and spread to the lungs, with significant long-term survival at day 180 postimplantation, tumor shrinking, and no relapses after 56 days off-drug. OP 30 mg/kg cohort tumors expressed significantly reduced levels of human N-cadherins and host CD31+ endothelial cells with concomitant significant expression of E-cadherins compared to the untreated cohorts. Conclusion OP monotherapy may be the effective treatment therapy for TNBC."

As the biology of this breast cancer subtype is better understood, it is clear that TNBC is a heterogeneous disease and one targeted therapy is unlikely to be active in all patients. Biomarkers predictive of response to treatment are thus of great importance in TNBC. This review outlines studies evaluating biomarkers predictive of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and to targeted therapies in the advanced setting. The development of validated biomarkers in conjunction with novel targeted therapies represents an opportunity to improve patient outcomes in TNBC."
