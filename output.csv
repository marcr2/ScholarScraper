"Multifunctional Biomimetic Liposomes with Improved Tumor-Targeting for TNBC Treatment by Combination of Chemotherapy, Anti-Angiogenesis and Immunotherapy.","[{'authorId': '2135772348', 'name': 'Jinshuai Lan'}, {'authorId': '2238908602', 'name': 'Lixia Chen'}, {'authorId': '2294973003', 'name': 'Zhe Li'}, {'authorId': '2150979555', 'name': 'Li Liu'}, {'authorId': '14525315', 'name': 'Ruifeng Zeng'}, {'authorId': '2238792828', 'name': 'Yitian He'}, {'authorId': '2295269393', 'name': 'Yi Shen'}, {'authorId': '2238908876', 'name': 'Tong Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2238890996', 'name': 'Yue Ding'}]",29,2024,f7cf5ace78c3f61da2308f8c54e22400b7afb848,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) featuring high relapses and metastasis showed limited clinical therapeutic efficiency with chemotherapy for the extremely complex tumor microenvironment (TME), especially angiogenesis and immunosuppression. Combination of anti-angiogenesis and immunotherapy holds promise for effective inhibition of tumor proliferation and invasion, while it remains challenging for specific targeting drug delivery to tumors and metastatic lesions. Here, a multifunctional biomimetic liposome loading Gambogic acid (G/R-MLP) was developed using Ginsenoside Rg3 (Rg3) to substitute cholesterol and cancer cell membrane coating, which was designed to increase long-circulating action by a low immunogenicity and specifically deliver Gambogic acid (GA) to tumor site and metastatic lesions by homologous targeting and glucose transporter (GLUT) targeting. After G/R-MLP accumulated in the primary tumors and metastatic nodules, it synergistically enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of GA, effectively suppressing the tumor growth and lung metastasis by killing tumor cells, inhibiting tumor cell migration and invasion, achieving anti-angiogenesis and improving the anti-tumor immunity. All in all, the strategy combining chemotherapy, anti-angiogenesis and immunotherapy improved therapeutic efficiency and prolonged survival, providing a new perspective for the clinical treatment of TNBC.

Historically, capecitabine has been the cornerstone of adjuvant therapy for TNBC patients not achieving a pathological complete response (pCR). However, the integration of new modalities such as immunotherapy and PARP inhibitors has prompted a re-evaluation of traditional post-neoadjuvant approaches. Methods: This review synthesizes data from pivotal clinical trials and meta-analyses to evaluate the efficacy of emerging therapies in the post-neoadjuvant setting. We focus on the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), PARP inhibitors (PARPis), and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) alongside or in place of capecitabine in TNBC treatment paradigms. Results: The addition of ICIs like pembrolizumab to neoadjuvant regimens has shown increased pCR rates and improved event-free survival, posing new questions about optimal post-neoadjuvant therapies. Similarly, PARPis have demonstrated efficacy in BRCA-mutated TNBC populations, with significant improvements in disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Emerging studies on ADCs further complicate the adjuvant landscape, offering potentially efficacious alternatives to capecitabine, especially in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy. Discussion: The challenge remains to integrate these new treatments into clinical practice effectively, considering factors such as drug resistance, patient-specific characteristics, and socio-economic barriers. This review discusses the implications of these therapies and suggests a future direction focused on personalized medicine approaches in TNBC. Conclusions: As the treatment landscape for TNBC evolves, the role of capecitabine is being critically examined. While it remains a viable option for certain patient groups, the introduction of ICIs, PARPis, and ADCs offers promising alternatives that could redefine adjuvant therapy standards. Ongoing and future trials will be pivotal in determining the optimal therapeutic strategies for TNBC patients with residual disease post-neoadjuvant therapy."
Synergistic Enhancement of TNBC Treatment in African American Women: Integrating Resveratrol with Electrical Pulse Therapy,"[{'authorId': '2131870501', 'name': 'Pragatheiswar Giri'}, {'authorId': '6468669', 'name': 'I.

This group experiences a 40% higher mortality rate compared to women of other ethnicities, highlighting a significant disparity, and underscoring the urgent need for the development of targeted, effective treatments, specifically tailored to address these demographic women. Towards this, the efficacy of high intensity, short duration electrical pulses combined with Resveratrol (Resv), a natural polyphenol, as a novel therapeutic agent against TNBC is investigated. Electrical pulses facilitate enhanced drug transport through the opening of pores in cell membrane for those molecules that are normally non-permeable. This approach addresses the challenge of Resv's limited bioavailability and enhances its apoptotic potential. Employing MDA-MB-468 cell line, derived from an African American woman, this study investigates the effects of Resv and electrical pulses (EP) on TNBC cells. The TNBC cells were treated with Resv and subjected to eight pulses of multiple electric fields ranging from 500V/cm to 1200V/cm at 100μs, and at 1Hz, followed by assessments monitoring viability, colony formation, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The results indicate an 84% reduction in live cancer cell viability and a 4-fold increase in ROS levels with the combined treatment, suggesting a promising approach to alternative TNBC therapy. This research evaluates a natural bio compound, along with an advanced drug delivery system, targeting a reduction in mortality rates and improved quality of life for TNBC patients."
DR-5 and DLL-4 mAb Functionalized SLNs of Gamma-Secretase Inhibitors- An Approach for TNBC Treatment,"[{'authorId': '47304999', 'name': 'M. Kumari'}, {'authorId': '48797710', 'name': 'P.

High rates of metastasis, poor prognosis, and drug resistance are the major problems associated with TNBC. The current chemotherapeutics eliminate only the bulk tumor cells (non-BCSCs) and do not affect breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). The BCSCs which are left behind after chemotherapy is reported to promote recurrence and metastasis of TNBC. Death receptor-5 (DR-5) is exclusively expressed in TNBCs and mediates the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. DR-5, therefore, can be exploited for targeted drug delivery and to induce apoptosis. Gamma-secretase mediated Notch signaling in BCSCs regulates its proliferation, differentiation, and metastasis. The endogenous ligand, Delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4), is reported to activate this Notch signaling in TNBC. Blocking this signaling pathway using both gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) and DLL4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) may produce synergistic benefits. Further, the GSIs (DAPT, LY-411575, RO4929097, MK0752, etc.) suffer from poor bioavailability and off-target side effects such as diarrhea, suppression of lymphopoiesis, headache, hypertension, fatigue, and ventricular dysfunctions. In this hypothesis, we discuss Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) based drug delivery systems containing GSIs and surface modified with DR-5 and DLL4 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to effectivity target and treat TNBC. The delivery system is designed to deliver the drug cargo precisely to TNBCs through its DR-5 receptors and hence expected to reduce the off-target side effects of GSIs. Further, DLL4 mAb and GSIs are expected to act synergistically to block the Notch signal mediated BCSCs proliferation, differentiation, and metastasis."

Therefore, the usual adjuvant treatments for breast cancer, are not applied to TNBC. Recently, it has been found that approximately one third of TNBC tumours express androgen receptor (AR) and it is associated with better response to endocrine therapies. However, the prognostic value of AR expression in TNBC is still unclear. Therefore, in this preliminary study we evaluate the effectiveness of an anti-androgen treatment (bicalutamide) respect to conventional treatments (doxorubicin and lapatinib) in TNBC human cell lines and their corresponding xenografts. Briefly, SUM149, SUM159 and MDAMB231 TNBC cell lines were cultured in supplemented medium. Cells were plated in 96-well plates and a serial dilution of Doxorubicin, Lapatinib, Bicatulamide and respective combinations were added. In addition, 106 cells were implanted subcutaneosly into five female mice (Balb/C SCID). When tumors developed, mice were treated with doxorubicin, bicalutamide, doxorubicin + bicalutamide and doxorubicin + bicalutamide + lapatinib. Every treatment was perfomed every 3 days during 15 days and tumor reduction and appearance of metastases were evaluated. Results from cell culture showed that neoplasic cells from each cell line were high sensitive to bicalutamide treatment (SUM149 EC50: 9,860e009; MDAMB231 EC50: 9,454e009; SUM159 EC50: 2,170e009). Also, viability decreased when we added an anti-androgen (bicalutamide) to the conventional treatments (doxorubicin + lapatinib). In vivo experiments revealed a greater percentage of tumour reduction (around 70%) in mice treated with combination of treatments and a lower appearance of metastasis was observed in this group respect to control group (SUM149: 40% vs 60%; MDA-MB-231: 20% vs 75%; SUM159: 20% vs 60%). Therefore, our preliminary findings suggest that the addition of an anti-androgenic agent to treatments currently in use can reduce the tumour considerably, defining anti-androgenic treatments as a novel effective therapeutic target.

While targeted therapies for TNBC are in various stages of development, current standard chemotherapies include taxanes such as paclitaxel and anthracycline agents. With the objective of specifically targeting invasive cancer, our group has been developing small-molecule inhibitors of the Rho GTPases Rac and Cdc42, which are known drivers of cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Of these, MBQ-167 inhibits both Rac and Cdc42 with IC50s of 103 and 78 nmol/L, respectively, and consequently inhibits p21-activated kinase (PAK) signaling, metastatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, tumor growth, and metastasis (Humphries-Bickley et al., Mol Cancer Ther 2017). We found that in addition to blocking HER2-type breast cancer progression, MBQ-167 is also highly effective against TNBC cell and tumor growth, as well as metastasis in mouse models. The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of MBQ-167 in combination with the current chemotherapeutic paclitaxel. We hypothesized that the combination of paclitaxel and MBQ-167 is a rational strategy to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in TNBC. To test this hypothesis, we administered a nontoxic dosage of individual MBQ-167, paclitaxel, or combined MBQ-167 and paclitaxel to immunocompromised mice bearing mammary fat pad tumors from GFP-tagged MDA-MB-468 or MDA-MB-231 human TNBC cells. Tumor growth was monitored weekly and metastasis was quantified at the end of the study. Treatment with MBQ-167 and/or paclitaxel resulted in reduced tumor growth by 70-80% in both models. In the MDA-MB-231 model, MBQ-167 paralleled paclitaxel treatment with a modest benefit in combined therapy. However, in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive TNBC model MDA-MB-468, MBQ-167 alone or in combination significantly reduced metastasis to the lungs and spleen, while paclitaxel alone increased metastasis to the liver, lungs, and spleen. These results show that MBQ-167 is a promising antimetastatic agent that can be effective in combination with current chemotherapeutic agents.

Current Treatment Landscape for Early Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC),"[{'authorId': '2108318343', 'name': 'Jieun Lee'}]",30,2023,4a9a213cd04a1a2862e2ff6e2cd9f5572e577f9e,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 15–20% of all breast cancers and is characterized by an aggressive nature and a high rate of recurrence despite neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy. Although novel agents are constantly being introduced for the treatment of breast cancer, conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy based on anthracyclines and taxanes is the mainstay treatment option for TNBC. Based on CTNeoBC pooled analysis data, the achievement of pathologic CR (pCR) in TNBC is directly linked to improved survival outcomes. Therefore, the treatment paradigm for early TNBC has shifted to neoadjuvant treatment, and the escalation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to improve the pCR rate and the addition of post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy to control the residual disease have been investigated. In this article, we review the current treatment landscape for early TNBC, from standard cytotoxic chemotherapy to recent data on immune checkpoint inhibitors, capecitabine, and olaparib."

However, the efficacy of this treatment strategy is limited for treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Gene therapy may be a more effective strategy for improving the prognosis of TNBC. Methods: A novel 25 nucleotide sense strand of miRNA was designed to treat TNBC by silencing the Slug gene, and encapsulated into DSPE-PEG2000-tLyp-1 peptide-modified functional liposomes. The efficacy of miRNA liposomes was evaluated on invasive TNBC cells and TNBC cancer-bearing nude mice. Furthermore, functional vinorelbine liposomes were constructed to investigate the anticancer effects of combined treatment. Results: The functional miRNA liposomes had a round shape and were nanosized (120 nm). Functional miRNA liposomes were effectively captured by TNBC cells in vitro and were target to mitochondria. Treatment with functional liposomes silenced the expression of Slug and Slug protein, inhibited the TGF-β1/Smad pathway, and inhibited invasiveness and growth of TNBC cells. In TNBC cancer-bearing mice, functional miRNA liposomes exerted a stronger anticancer effect than functional vinorelbine liposomes, and combination therapy with these two formulations resulted in nearly complete inhibition of tumor growth. Preliminary safety evaluations indicated that the functional miRNA liposomes did not affect body weight or cause damage to any major organs. Furthermore, the functional liposomes significantly increased the half-life of the drug in the blood of cancer-bearing nude mice, and increased drug accumulation in breast cancer tissues. Conclusion: In this study, we constructed novel functional miRNA liposomes. These liposomes silenced Slug expression and inhibited the TGF-β1/Smad pathway in TNBC cells, and enhanced anticancer efficacy in mice using combined chemotherapy. Hence, the present study demonstrated a promising strategy for gene therapy of invasive breast cancer."
DNA Damage Inducer Mitoxantrone Amplifies Synergistic Mild‐Photothermal Chemotherapy for TNBC via Decreasing Heat Shock Protein 70 Expression,"[{'authorId': '48354775', 'name': 'Zuqin Chen'}, {'authorId': '2133439403', 'name': 'Sun Li'}, {'authorId': '2146328686', 'name': 'Fangzhou Li'}, {'authorId': '2214600416', 'name': 'Cheng Qin'}, {'authorId': '2130360766', 'name': 'Xianlei Li'}, {'authorId': '1381181475', 'name': 'Guangchao Qing'}, {'authorId': '2110177153', 'name': 'Jinjin Wang'}, {'authorId': '2143387543', 'name': 'Bozhang Xia'}, {'authorId': '98353445', 'name': 'Fuxue Zhang'}, {'authorId': '3915540', 'name': 'Liangliang Meng'}, {'authorId': '143658460', 'name': 'Xing-jie Liang'}, {'authorId': '4034136', 'name': 'Yueyong Xiao'}]",26,2023,239ca06fe9da0b279dc1087ef08a9e19c146f9f6,"Patients with triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) have the worst clinical outcomes when compared to other subtypes of breast cancer. Nanotechnology‐assisted photothermal therapy (PTT) opens new opportunities for precise cancer treatment. However, thermoresistance caused by PTT, as well as uncertainty in the physiological metabolism of existing phototherapeutic nanoformulations, severely limit their clinical applications. Herein, based on the clinically chemotherapeutic drug mitoxantrone (MTO), a multifunctional nanoplatform (MTO‐micelles) is developed to realize mutually synergistic mild‐photothermal chemotherapy. MTO with excellent near‐infrared absorption (≈669 nm) can function not only as a chemotherapeutic agent but also as a photothermal transduction agent with elevated photothermal conversion efficacy (ƞ = 54.62%). MTO‐micelles can accumulate at the tumor site through the enhanced permeability and retention effect. Following local near‐infrared irradiation, mild hyperthermia (<50 °C) assists MTO in binding tumor cell DNA, resulting in chemotherapeutic sensitization. In addition, downregulation of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) expression due to enhanced DNA damage can in turn weaken tumor thermoresistance, boosting the efficacy of mild PTT. Both in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that MTO‐micelles possess excellent synergetic tumor inhibition effects. Therefore, the mild‐photothermal chemotherapy strategy based on MTO‐micelles has a promising prospect in the clinical transformation of TNBC treatment."

Taxane and anthracycline-containing chemotherapy (CT) is currently the main systemic treatment option for TNBC, while platinum-based chemotherapy showed promising results in the neoadjuvant and metastatic settings. An early arising of intrinsic or acquired CT resistance is common and represents the main hurdle for successful TNBC treatment. Numerous mechanisms were uncovered that can lead to the development of chemoresistance. These include cancer stem cells (CSCs) induction after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, hypoxia and avoidance of apoptosis, single factors such as tyrosine kinase receptors (EGFR, IGFR1), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10), and a few pathological molecular pathways. Some biomarkers capable of predicting resistance to specific chemotherapeutic agents were identified and are expected to be validated in future studies for a more accurate selection of drugs to be employed and for a more tailored approach, both in neoadjuvant and advanced settings. Recently, based on specific biomarkers, some therapies were tailored to TNBC subsets and became available in clinical practice: olaparib and talazoparib for BRCA1/2 germline mutation carriers larotrectinib and entrectinib for neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusion carriers, and anti-trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (Trop2) antibody drug conjugate therapy for heavily pretreated metastatic TNBC (mTNBC). Further therapies targeting some pathologic molecular pathways, apoptosis, miRNAS, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), and androgen receptor (AR) are under investigation. Among them, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and EGFR inhibitors as well as antiandrogens showed promising results and are under evaluation in Phase II/III clinical trials.

Conventional chemotherapy remains the only treatment regimen against TNBC and suffers several limitations such as low bioavailability, systemic toxicity, less targetability, and multi-drug resistance. Although various targeted therapies have been introduced to manage the hardship of TNBC, they still experience certain limitations associated with the survival benefits. The current research thus aimed at developing and improving the strategies for effective therapy against TNBC. Such strategies involved the emergence of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles are designated as nanocavalries, loaded with various agents (drugs, genes, etc.) to battle the progression and metastasis of TNBC along with overcoming the limitations experienced by conventional chemotherapy and targeted therapy.

Despite progress on the underlying tumor biology, clinical outcomes for TNBC unfortunately remain poor. The median overall survival for patients with metastatic TNBC is approximately eighteen months. Chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment while there is a growing body of evidence that targeted therapies may be on the horizon with poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and immune check-point inhibitors already established in the treatment paradigm of TNBC. A large number of novel therapeutic agents are being evaluated for their efficacy in TNBC. As novel therapeutics are now incorporated into clinical practice, it is clear that tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution can result to de novo or acquired treatment resistance. As precision medicine and next generation sequencing is part of cancer diagnostics, tailored treatment approaches based on the expression of molecular markers are currently being implemented in clinical practice and clinical trial design. The scope of this review is to highlight the most relevant current knowledge regarding underlying molecular profile of TNBC and its potential application in clinical practice."
Adapalene and Doxorubicin Synergistically Promote Apoptosis of TNBC Cells by Hyperactivation of the ERK1/2 Pathway Through ROS Induction,"[{'authorId': '89403341', 'name': 'Umar Mehraj'}, {'authorId': '34018094', 'name': 'I.

It has a limited therapeutic index owing to its extreme toxicity and the emergence of drug resistance. As a result, there is a pressing need to find innovative drugs that enhance the effectiveness of doxorubicin while minimizing its toxicity. The rationale of the present study is that combining emerging treatment agents or repurposed pharmaceuticals with doxorubicin might increase susceptibility to therapeutics and the subsequent establishment of improved pharmacological combinations for treating triple-negative breast cancer. Additionally, combined treatment will facilitate dosage reduction, reducing the toxicity associated with doxorubicin. Recently, the third-generation retinoid adapalene was reported as an effective anticancer agent in several malignancies. This study aimed to determine the anticancer activity of adapalene in TNBC cells and its effectiveness in combination with doxorubicin, and the mechanistic pathways in inhibiting tumorigenicity. Adapalene inhibits tumor cell growth and proliferation and acts synergistically with doxorubicin in inhibiting growth, colony formation, and migration of TNBC cells. Also, the combination of adapalene and doxorubicin enhanced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species triggering hyperphosphorylation of Erk1/2 and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that adapalene is a promising antitumor agent that may be used as a single agent or combined with present therapeutic regimens for TNBC treatment."

Although target-based therapeutic options are approved for other cancers, only limited therapeutic options are available for TNBC.

However, most of these cancers are unresponsive, and there is a requirement for more effective treatment modalities. Further, there is a lack of effective biomarkers that can distinguish TNBC from other BC subtypes. ER, PR, and HER2 help identify TNBC and are widely used to identify patients who are most likely to respond to diverse therapeutic strategies. In this review, we discuss the possible treatment options for TNBC based on its inherent subtype receptors and pathways, such as p53 signaling, AKT signaling, cell cycle regulation, DNA damage, and programmed cell death, which play essential roles at multiple stages of TNBC development. We focus on poly-ADP ribose polymerase 1, androgen receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, and epidermal growth factor receptor as well as the application of nanomedicine and immunotherapy in TNBC and discuss their potential applications in drug development for TNBC."

The role played by the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and its cognate receptor IGF-1R in TNBC has been reported. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms by which the IGF-1/IGF-1R system may contribute to TNBC progression still remains to be fully understood. By computational analysis of the vast cancer genomics information in public databases (TCGA and METABRIC), we obtained evidence that high IGF-1 or IGF-1R levels correlate with a worse clinical outcome in TNBC patients. Further bioinformatics analysis revealed that both the focal adhesion and the Hippo pathways are enriched in TNBC harboring an elevated expression of IGF-1 or IGF-1R. Mechanistically, we found that in TNBC cells, the IGF-1/IGF-1R system promotes the activation of the FAK signal transduction pathway, which in turn regulates the nuclear accumulation of YAP (yes-associated protein/yes-related protein) and the expression of its target genes. At the biological level, we found that the IGF-1/IGF-1R-FAK-YAP network cascade triggers the growth potential of TNBC cells, as evaluated in different experimental systems. Overall, our results suggest that the IGF-1/IGF-1R/FAK/YAP axis may contribute to the progression of the aggressive TNBC subtype."

Furthermore, we have also investigated the HuR therapeutic relevance in TNBCs, which is an aggressive breast cancer subtype. Using an online meta-analysis tool, we found that HuR protein overexpression positively correlates with reduced overall survival of TNBC patients (p = 0.028). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the TNBC breast cancer cell lines i.e., MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 are good model systems to study HuR protein, as they both exhibit a significant amount of cytoplasmic HuR (active form). Quercetin treatment significantly inhibited the cytoplasmic HuR in both TNBC cell lines. By using specific HuR siRNA, we established that quercetin-mediated inhibition of adhesion and migration of TNBC cells is dependent on HuR. Upon analyzing adhesion proteins i.e., β-catenin and CD44, we found that quercetin mediated effect on TNBC adhesion and migration was through the HuR-β-catenin axis and CD44, independently. Overall, the present results demonstrate that elevated HuR levels are associated with TNBC progression and relapse, and the ability of quercetin to inhibit cytoplasmic HuR protein provides a rationale for using it as an anticancer agent for the treatment of aggressive TNBCs.

TNBC (Triple-negative breast cancer) has limited treatment options and still lacks viable molecular targets, leading to poor outcomes. Recently, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have been shown to play crucial roles in human cancers, including BC, by modulating a number of oncogenic phenotypes. This suggests that RBPs represent potential molecular targets for BC therapy. Methods: We employed genomic data to identify RBPs specifically expressed in TNBC. NONO was silenced in TNBC cell lines to examine cell growth, colony formation, invasion, and migration. Gene expression profiles in NONO-silenced cells were generated and analyzed. A high-throughput screening for NONO-targeted drugs was performed using an FDA-approved library. Results: We found that the NONO RBP is highly expressed in TNBC and is associated with poor patient outcomes. NONO binds to STAT3 mRNA, increasing STAT3 mRNA levels in TNBC. Surprisingly, NONO directly interacts with STAT3 protein increasing its stability and transcriptional activity, thus contributing to its oncogenic function. Importantly, high-throughput drug screening revealed that auranofin is a potential NONO inhibitor and inhibits cell growth in TNBC. Conclusions: NONO is an RBP upstream regulator of both STAT3 RNA and protein levels and function. It represents an important and clinically relevant promoter of growth and resistance of TNBCs. NONO is also therefore a potential therapeutic target in TNBC."

Experimental discovery of molecular signatures including the ‘BRCAness’ highlighted the innate heterogeneity of TNBC, generating the diversity of TNBC phenotypes. As it contributes to enhancing genomic instability, it has widened the therapeutic spectrum of TNBC. In particular, unusual sensitivity to DNA damaging agents was denoted in patients with BRCA deficiency, suggesting therapeutic benefit from platinum and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors. However, regardless of enriched chemosensitivity and immunogenicity, majority of patients with TNBC still suffer from dismal clinical outcomes including early relapse and metastatic spread. Therefore, efforts into more precise and personalised treatment are critical at this point. Accordingly, the advance of multiomics has revealed novel actionable targets including PI3K-Akt-mTOR and epidermal growth factor receptor signalling pathways, which might actively participate in modulating the chemosensitivity and immune system. Also, TNBC has long been considered a potential protagonist of immunotherapy in breast cancer, supported by abundant tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and heterogeneous tumour microenvironment. Despite that, earlier studies showed somewhat unsatisfactory results of monotherapy with immune-checkpoint inhibitors, consistently durable responses in responders were noteworthy. Based on these results, further combinatorial trials either with other chemotherapy or targeted agents are underway. Incorporating immune-molecular targets into combination as well as refining the standard chemotherapy might be the key to unlock the future of TNBC. In this review, we share the current and upcoming treatment options of TNBC in the framework of scientific and clinical data, especially focusing on early stage of TNBC."

However, we are now witnessing the dawn of targeted therapies for TNBC in which progress has stemmed from an improved understanding of the components that make TNBC unique. The identification of biomarkers, such as BRCA1/2, PIK3CA and RSK2, have advanced the field remarkably and there is considerable interest in finding novel therapeutics for TNBC that offer durable clinical benefit with fewer adverse events. Areas covered We discuss phase I/II trials of new and emerging targeted therapies for TNBC, according to ClinicalTrials.gov up to June 2020. Although the emphasis is on ongoing and completed early phase trials, we also highlight pivotal studies that have led to the approval of new targeted classes of drugs for TNBC, with a focus on outcomes and common adverse events of each class of therapy. Expert opinion The way forward for TNBC treatment is through precision medicine. The use of novel agents matched with biomarkers to identify patients with the best chance of sustainable response offers new hope. We now have great potential for improving the outcomes for patients with TNBC."

The presence of one or more of these receptors suggests that a treatment targeting these pathways might be effective, while the absence of, or in the case of HER2, lack of overexpression of, all of these receptors, termed triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), indicates a need for the more toxic chemotherapy. In an effort to develop targeted therapies for TNBC, it will be necessary to differentiate among specific TNBC subtypes. The subset of TNBC that expresses androgen receptor (AR) has been determined to express genes consistent with a luminal subtype and therefore may be amenable to therapies targeting either AR, itself, or other pathways typical of a luminal subtype. Recent investigations of the AR signal pathway within breast cancer lead to AR as a significant target for breast cancer therapy with several clinical trials currently in progress. The subclass of TNBC that lacks AR, which we have termed quadruple negative breast cancer (QNBC) currently lacks a defined targetable pathway. Unlike AR-positive TNBC, QNBC predominantly exhibits a basal-like molecular subtype. Several subtypes and related pathway proteins are preferentially expressed in QNBC that may serve as effective targets for treatment, such as ACSL4, SKP2 and EGFR. ACSL4 expression has been demonstrated to be inversely correlated with expression of hormone/growth factor receptors and may thus serve as a biomarker for QNBC as well as a target for therapy. In the following review we summarize some of the current efforts to develop alternatives to chemotherapy for TNBC and QNBC."

Bevacizumab adds to the efficacy of chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer; however, there is limited data on the safety or efficacy of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. Thus, we sought to explore the safety and efficacy of the addition of bevacizumab to cisplatin in the treatment of TNBC.


METHODS
51 patients (pts) with confirmed TNBC provided informed consent and were enrolled in a single arm phase II trial of neoadjuvant cisplatin 75 mg/m2 q 3 weeks x 4 cycles and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg q 3 weeks x 3 cycles prior to definitive surgery. Only 3 cycles of bevacizumab were delivered to allow 6 weeks between the last dose of bevacizumab and surgery. Research biopsies were obtained and breast MRI performed before treatment and at surgery. Postoperatively, pts received doxorubicin and cytoxan (AC) plus bevacizumab or AC/Taxol plus bevacizumab. Median age was 50 yrs (range 30 to 66 yrs); tumors were clinical T1 (2%), T2 (80%), T3 (18%).


RESULTS
Forty-six pts are evaluable for response and 5 pts are still receiving neoadjuvant therapy. Clinical responses to date: 12/46 (26%) clinical complete response (cCR), 24/46 (52%) clinical partial response (cPR), 5/46 (11%) stable disease (SD), and 1/46 (2%) progressive disease (PD). Non-responders included 4/46 (9%) pts who discontinued protocol therapy for toxicity. To date, 7/46 (15%) pts achieved a complete pathological response (Miller-Payne 5) and an additional 10/46 (22%) were Miller-Payne 4. Five pts did not complete neoadjuvant therapy, 2 with tinnitus/hearing loss and 3 with grade 4 toxicities consisting of refractory hypertension in 1 pt and pulmonary embolism (PE) in 2 pts. Tissue-based assays to predict platinum/bevacizumab responses, including BRCA1/2 status, are underway.


CONCLUSIONS
Cisplatin and bevacizumab has some activity in TNBC as demonstrated by 37% of evaluable pts with a Miller-Payne 4 or 5 pathological response. However, toxicity, including tinnitus/hearing loss, hypertension and PE, limited completion of neoadjuvant therapy in 11% of pts. No significant financial relationships to disclose."

Treatment for TNBC can be challenging since the disease has various molecular subtypes. A variety of treatment options are available, such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. Chemotherapy is the most common of these options. TNBC is generally treated with systemic chemotherapy using drugs such as anthracyclines and taxanes in neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings.

It is imperative that researchers, clinicians, and pharmaceutical companies work together to develop effective treatment options for TNBC.

The signal for phosphatidylcholine (PC) (32:1) at m/z 732.5 was significantly higher in the recurrence group compared to the non-recurrence group (P = 0.024). PC (32:1) was more abundant in the cancer epithelial area than it was in the surrounding stroma, suggesting that abnormal lipid metabolism was associated with malignant transformation. Our results indicate PC (32:1) as a candidate predictive factor of TNBC recurrence.

To date, therapies directed to specific molecular targets have rarely achieved clinically meaningful improvements in outcomes of patients with TNBC, and chemotherapy remains the standard of care. Here, we seek to review the most recent efforts to classify TNBC based on the comprehensive profiling of tumors for cellular composition and molecular features. Technologic advances allow for tumor characterization at ever-increasing depth, generating data that, if integrated with clinical-pathologic features, may help improve risk stratification of patients, guide treatment decisions and surveillance, and help identify new targets for drug development. SIGNIFICANCE: TNBC is characterized by higher rates of relapse, greater metastatic potential, and shorter overall survival compared with other major breast cancer subtypes. The identification of biomarkers that can help guide treatment decisions in TNBC remains a clinically unmet need. Understanding the mechanisms that drive resistance is key to the design of novel therapeutic strategies to help prevent the development of metastatic disease and, ultimately, to improve survival in this patient population."

MiR-27a Modulates Radiosensitivity of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) Cells by Targeting CDC27,"[{'authorId': '46300922', 'name': 'Yong-qiang Ren'}, {'authorId': '2083632068', 'name': 'Fengkui Fu'}, {'authorId': '1780602', 'name': 'Jianjun Han'}]",54,2015,57bc34cf82d275ac24009ca2858f1c180c4cc42c,"Background MiR-27a is significantly overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the exact biological function of MiR-27a in TNBC is not fully understood. In this study, we verified miR-27a expression in TNBC cells and explored how its overexpression modulates radiosensitivity of the cells. Material/Method qRT-PCR analysis was performed to study miR-27a expression in TNBC lines MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 and in normal human breast epithelial cell line MCF10A. Dual luciferase assay was performed to verify a putative downstream target of miR-27a, CDC27. CCK-8 assay was used to assess the influence of miR-27a-CDC27 axis on cell proliferation under irradiation (IR) treatment. Results We confirmed significantly higher miR-27a expression in 2 TNBC cell lines – MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 – than in human breast epithelial cell line MCF10A. miR-27a could modulate proliferation and radiosensitivity of TNBC cells. CDC-27 is a direct target of miR-27a and its downregulation conferred increased radioresistance of the cells. Conclusions The miR-27a-CDC27 axis might play an important role in modulating response to radiotherapy in TNBC cells. Testing miR-27a expression might be a useful way to identify a subgroup of patients who will benefit from an IR-based therapeutic approach."

There is a vital need for effective targeted therapeutics for TNBC patients, yet treatment strategies are challenged by the significant intertumoral heterogeneity within the TNBC subtype and its surrounding microenvironment. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) are highly expressed in several TNBC subtypes and are promising therapeutic targets. In this study, we targeted the MET receptor, which is highly expressed across several TNBC subtypes. Experimental Design: Using the small-molecule inhibitor cabozantinib (XL184), we examined the efficacy of MET inhibition in preclinical models that recapitulate human TNBC and its microenvironment. To analyze the dynamic interactions between TNBC cells and fibroblasts over time, we utilized a 3D model referred to as MAME (Mammary Architecture and Microenvironment Engineering) with quantitative image analysis. To investigate cabozantinib inhibition in vivo, we used a novel xenograft model that expresses human HGF and supports paracrine MET signaling. Results: XL184 treatment of MAME cultures of MDA-MB-231 and HCC70 cells (± HGF-expressing fibroblasts) was cytotoxic and significantly reduced multicellular invasive outgrowths, even in cultures with HGF-expressing fibroblasts. Treatment with XL184 had no significant effects on METneg breast cancer cell growth. In vivo assays demonstrated that cabozantinib treatment significantly inhibited TNBC growth and metastasis. Conclusions: Using preclinical TNBC models that recapitulate the breast tumor microenvironment, we demonstrate that cabozantinib inhibition is an effective therapeutic strategy in several TNBC subtypes.

The main treatment option remains chemotherapy, despite limited efficacy. New biologic and targeted agents are increasingly emerging for the treatment of TNBC. Given the continuous advances in the field of TNBC, this review assesses the latest developments in basic characterization, subtyping, and treatment of TNBC, including novel drug developments with antibody-drug conjugates, immune checkpoint inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and androgen receptor targeted agents. Abstract Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy affecting women. It is a highly heterogeneous disease broadly defined by the differential expression of cell surface receptors. In the United States, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents 15 to 20% of all BC. When compared with other subtypes of BC, TNBC tends to present in younger women, and has a higher mortality rate of 40% in advanced stages within the first 5 years after diagnosis. TNBC has historically had limited treatment options when compared to other types of BC. The mainstay of treatment for TNBC remains cytotoxic chemotherapy despite the emergence of new biologic and targeted agents. Defining the specific tumor molecular profile including PDL-1 and androgen receptor testing is expanding treatment options in the clinical setting. Identifying more targetable, novel biomarkers that may better define therapeutic targets or prognostic markers is currently underway. TNBC nomenclature is expected to be updated in favor of other nomenclature which would help direct therapy, and further redefine TNBC’s heterogeneity. Given the continuous advances in the field of TNBC, this review assesses the latest developments in basic characterization, subtyping, and treatment of TNBC, including novel drug developments with antibody-drug conjugates, immune checkpoint inhibitors, PARP inhibitors and androgen receptor targeted agents. Future trials are necessary in the face of these innovations to further support the use of new therapies in TNBC and the detection of the appropriate biomarkers."
The pan-PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 activates canonical WNT signaling to confer resistance in TNBC cells: resistance reversal with WNT inhibitor,"[{'authorId': '122972925', 'name': 'Huey-En Tzeng'}, {'authorId': '46554492', 'name': 'Lixin Yang'}, {'authorId': '50053867', 'name': 'Kemin Chen'}, {'authorId': '153709759', 'name': 'Yafan Wang'}, {'authorId': '46398283', 'name': 'Yun-Ru Liu'}, {'authorId': '52145162', 'name': 'S.

However, this treatment is ineffective for unknown reasons. Here, we report that aberrant expression of wingless-type MMTV integration site family (WNT) and activated WNT signals, which crosstalk with the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway through GSK3β, plays the most critical role in resistance to pan-PI3K inhibitors in TNBC cells. GDC-0941 is a pan-PI3K inhibitor that activates the WNT/beta-catenin pathway in TNBC cells through stimulation of WNT secretion. GDC-0941-triggered WNT/beta-catenin pathway activation was observed in MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells, which are TNBC cell lines showing aberrant WNT/beta-catenin activation, and not in SKBR3 and MCF7 cells. This observation is further investigated in vivo. GDC-0941 exhibited minimal tumor inhibition in MDA-MB-231 cells, but it significantly suppressed tumor growth in HER-positive SK-BR3 cells. In vivo mechanism study revealed the activation of WNT/beta-catenin pathway by GDC-0941. A synergistic effect was observed when combined treatment with GDC-0941 and the WNT inhibitor LGK974 at low concentrations in MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings indicated that WNT pathway activation conferred resistance in TNBC cells treated with GDC-0941. This resistance may be further circumvented through combined treatment with pan-PI3K and WNT inhibitors. Future clinical trials of these two inhibitors are warranted."

TNBC is characterized by a wide range of genetic, immunophenotypic, morphological, and clinical features. TNBC is coined to describe cancers that lack estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). As a result, hormonal or trastuzumab-based treatments are ineffective in TNBC patients. TNBCs are biologically aggressive, and despite some evidence that they respond to treatment better than other forms of breast cancer, the prognosis remains poor. This is attributed to a shorter disease-free interval in adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings, as well as a more aggressive metastatic course. TNBC has a lot of clinical ramifications. In terms of new treatment methods, TNBC has lagged behind other types of breast cancer. There are not many options for treating this form of breast cancer because it is progressive. Many effective treatments for most breast cancers block the growth-stimulating effects of ER, PR, and/or HER2, leaving TNBC with few choices. Finding new and effective treatment options for TNBC remains a critical clinical need. To develop more effective drugs, new experimental approaches must be tested in patients with TNBC."

This phase II study evaluated the antitumor activity and safety of enzalutamide in patients with locally advanced or metastatic AR-positive TNBC. Patients and Methods Tumors were tested for AR with an immunohistochemistry assay optimized for breast cancer; nuclear AR staining > 0% was considered positive. Patients received enzalutamide 160 mg once per day until disease progression. The primary end point was clinical benefit rate (CBR) at 16 weeks. Secondary end points included CBR at 24 weeks, progression-free survival, and safety. End points were analyzed in all enrolled patients (the intent-to-treat [ITT] population) and in patients with one or more postbaseline assessment whose tumor expressed ≥ 10% nuclear AR (the evaluable subgroup). Results Of 118 patients enrolled, 78 were evaluable. CBR at 16 weeks was 25% (95% CI, 17% to 33%) in the ITT population and 33% (95% CI, 23% to 45%) in the evaluable subgroup. Median progression-free survival was 2.9 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 3.7 months) in the ITT population and 3.3 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 4.1 months) in the evaluable subgroup. Median overall survival was 12.7 months (95% CI, 8.5 months to not yet reached) in the ITT population and 17.6 months (95% CI, 11.6 months to not yet reached) in the evaluable subgroup. Fatigue was the only treatment-related grade 3 or higher adverse event with an incidence of > 2%. Conclusion Enzalutamide demonstrated clinical activity and was well tolerated in patients with advanced AR-positive TNBC. Adverse events related to enzalutamide were consistent with its known safety profile. This study supports additional development of enzalutamide in advanced TNBC."

Poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitor and anti-programmed death receptor-1 inhibitor monotherapy have shown limited clinical activity in patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).


Objective
To evaluate the clinical activity (primary) and safety (secondary) of combination treatment with niraparib and pembrolizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic TNBC.


Design, Setting, and Participants
This open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study enrolled 55 eligible patients with advanced or metastatic TNBC irrespective of BRCA mutation status or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression at 34 US sites. Data were collected from January 3, 2017, through October 29, 2018, and analyzed from October 29, 2018, through February 27, 2019.


Interventions
Patients were administered 200 mg of oral niraparib once daily in combination with 200 mg of intravenous pembrolizumab on day 1 of each 21-day cycle.


Main Outcomes and Measures
The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. Secondary end points were safety, disease control rate (DCR; complete response plus partial response plus stable disease), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival.


Results
Within the full study population of 55 women (median age, 54 years [range, 32-90 years]), 5 patients had confirmed complete responses, 5 had confirmed partial responses, 13 had stable disease, and 24 had progressive disease. In the efficacy-evaluable population (n = 47), ORR included 10 patients (21%; 90% CI, 12%-33%) and DCR included 23 (49%; 90% CI, 36%-62%). Median DOR was not reached at the time of the data cutoff, with 7 patients still receiving treatment at the time of analysis. In 15 evaluable patients with tumor BRCA mutations, ORR included 7 patients(47%; 90% CI, 24%-70%), DCR included 12 (80%; 90% CI, 56%-94%), and median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI, 2.1 months to not estimable). In 27 evaluable patients with BRCA wild-type tumors, ORR included 3 patients (11%; 90% CI, 3%-26%), DCR included 9 (33%; 90% CI, 19%-51%), and median PFS was 2.1 months (95% CI, 1.4-2.5 months). The most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were anemia (10 [18%]), thrombocytopenia (8 [15%]), and fatigue (4 [7%]). Immune-related adverse events were reported in 8 patients (15%) and were grade 3 in 2 patients (4%); no new safety signals were detected.


Conclusions and Relevance
Combination niraparib plus pembrolizumab provides promising antitumor activity in patients with advanced or metastatic TNBC, with numerically higher response rates in those with tumor BRCA mutations. The combination therapy was safe with a tolerable safety profile, warranting further investigation.

To our knowledge, there is no consensus regarding differences in treatment and mortality between non-Hispanic African American and non-Hispanic White women with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Little is known about whether racial disparities vary by sociodemographic, clinical, and neighborhood factors.


Objective
To examine the differences in clinical treatment and outcomes between African American and White women in a nationally representative cohort of patients with TNBC and further examine the contributions of sociodemographic, clinical, and neighborhood factors to TNBC outcome disparities.


Design, Setting, and Participants
This population-based, retrospective cohort study included 23 123 women who received a diagnosis of nonmetastatic TNBC between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015, followed up through December 31, 2016, and identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data set. The study was conducted from July 2019 to November 2020. The analyses were performed from July 2019 to June 2020.


Exposures
Race and ethnicity, including non-Hispanic African American and non-Hispanic White race.


Main Outcomes and Measures
Using logistic regression analysis and competing risk regression analysis, we estimated odds ratios (ORs) of receipt of treatment and hazard ratios (HRs) of breast cancer mortality in African American patients compared with White patients.


Results
Of 23 213 participants, 5881 (25.3%) were African American women and 17 332 (74.7%) were White women. Compared with White patients, African American patients had lower odds of receiving surgery (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.60-0.79) and chemotherapy (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81-0.99) after adjustment for sociodemographic, clinicopathologic, and county-level factors. During a 43-month follow-up, 3276 patients (14.2%) died of breast cancer. The HR of breast cancer mortality was 1.28 (95% CI, 1.18-1.38) for African American individuals after adjustment for sociodemographic and county-level factors. Further adjustment for clinicopathological and treatment factors reduced the HR to 1.16 (95% CI, 1.06-1.25). This association was observed in patients living in socioeconomically less deprived counties (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.14-1.39), urban patients (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.11-1.32), patients having stage II (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.02-1.39) or III (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01-1.31) tumors that were treated with chemotherapy, and patients younger than 65 years (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.12-1.37).


Conclusions and Relevance
In this retrospective cohort study, African American women with nonmetastatic TNBC had a significantly higher risk of breast cancer mortality compared with their White counterparts, which was partially explained by their disparities in receipt of surgery and chemotherapy."

EndoTAG-1, composed of paclitaxel embedded in liposomal membranes targeting tumor endothelial cells, was evaluated for safety and efficacy in advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
One hundred and forty patients were treated with weekly EndoTAG-1 (22 mg/m(2)) plus paclitaxel (70 mg/m(2)), twice weekly EndoTAG-1 (2× 44 mg/m(2)), or weekly paclitaxel (90 mg/m(2)) for greater than or equal to four cycles (3-week treatment + 1-week rest) or until progression/toxicity. Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) rate evaluated centrally after four cycles of therapy (week 16). The study was not powered for intergroup comparisons.


RESULTS
The PFS rate at week 16 was 59.1% [one-sided 95% CI: 45.6, ∞] on combination treatment, 34.2% [21.6, ∞] on EndoTAG-1, and 48.0% [30.5, ∞] on paclitaxel. Median PFS reached 4.2, 3.4, and 3.7 months, respectively. After complete treatment (week 41 analysis), median overall survival (OS) was 13.0, 11.9, and 13.1 months for the modified Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population and 15.1, 12.5, and 8.9 months for the per-protocol population, respectively. The clinical benefit rate was 53%, 31%, and 36% for the treatment groups. Safety analysis revealed known toxicities of the drugs with slight increases of grade 3/4 neutropenia on combination therapy.


CONCLUSION
Treatment of advanced TNBC with a combination of EndoTAG-1 and standard paclitaxel [Taxol® (Bristol-Myers Squibb GmbH), or equivalent generic formulation] was well tolerated and showed antitumor efficacy. The positive trend needs to be confirmed in a randomized phase III trial.

The development of new TNBC treatment strategies has become an urgent clinical need. Diagnosis and subtyping of TNBC are essential to establish alternative treatments and targeted therapies for every TNBC patient. Chemotherapy, particularly with anthracycline and taxanes, remains the backbone for medical management for both early and metastatic TNBC. More recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapy have revolutionized cancer treatment. Included in the different strategies studied for TNBC treatment is drug repurposing. Despite the numerous medications available, numerous studies in medicinal chemistry are still aimed at the synthesis of new compounds in order to find new antiproliferative agents capable of treating TNBC. Additionally, some supplemental micronutrients, nutraceuticals and functional foods can potentially reduce the risk of developing cancer or can retard the rate of growth and metastases of established malignant diseases. Finally, nanotechnology in medicine, termed nanomedicines, introduces nanoparticles of variable chemistry and architecture for cancer treatment. This review highlights the most recent studies in search of new therapies for the treatment of TNBC, along with nutraceuticals and repositioning of drugs."
"The latest progress in research on triple negative breast cancer (TNBC): risk factors, possible therapeutic targets and prognostic markers.","[{'authorId': '3654541', 'name': 'Qingli Jiao'}, {'authorId': '145007525', 'name': 'Aiguo Wu'}, {'authorId': '4754998', 'name': 'Guo-li Shao'}, {'authorId': '49349364', 'name': 'Haoyu Peng'}, {'authorId': '3571892', 'name': 'Mengchuan Wang'}, {'authorId': '145508958', 'name': 'Shu-feng Ji'}, {'authorId': '2108283725', 'name': 'Peng Liu'}, {'authorId': '2151811977', 'name': 'Jian Zhang'}]",54,2014,0376449684f46a37a39b06bf2f144fed0eb28464,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one type of breast cancer (BC), which is defined as negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (Her2). Its origins and development seem to be elusive. And for now, drugs like tamoxifen or trastuzumab which specifically apply to ER, PR or Her2 positive BC seem unforeseeable in TNBC clinical treatment. Due to its extreme malignancy, high recurrence rate and poor prognosis, a lot of work on the research of TNBC is needed. This review aims to summarize the latest findings in TNBC in risk factors, possible therapeutic targets and possible prognostic makers."
Triple-negative breast cancer: is there a treatment on the horizon?,"[{'authorId': '50018065', 'name': 'Hui Yao'}, {'authorId': '5594019', 'name': 'Guangchun He'}, {'authorId': '48700238', 'name': 'Shichao Yan'}, {'authorId': '2145762446', 'name': 'Chao Chen'}, {'authorId': '47237361', 'name': 'Liujiang Song'}, {'authorId': '4038296', 'name': 'T.

These tumors have a more aggressive phenotype and a poorer prognosis due to the high propensity for metastatic progression and absence of specific targeted treatments. Patients with TNBC do not benefit from hormonal or trastuzumab-based targeted therapies because of the loss of target receptors. Although these patients respond to chemotherapeutic agents such as taxanes and anthracyclines better than other subtypes of breast cancer, prognosis remains poor. A group of targeted therapies under investigation showed favorable results in TNBC, especially in cancers with BRCA mutation. The lipid-lowering statins (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors), including lovastatin and simvastatin, have been shown to preferentially target TNBC compared with non-TNBC. These statins hold great promise for the management of TNBC. Only with the understanding of the molecular basis for the preference of statins for TNBC and more investigations in clinical trials can they be reformulated into a clinically approved drug against TNBC."
An Intelligent Biomimetic Nanoplatform for Holistic Treatment of Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer via Photothermal Ablation and Immune Remodeling.,"[{'authorId': '2153512775', 'name': 'Yuanyuan Cheng'}, {'authorId': '2146380497', 'name': 'Qian Chen'}, {'authorId': '92906016', 'name': 'Zhaoyang Guo'}, {'authorId': '50651695', 'name': 'Mengwen Li'}, {'authorId': '2170157', 'name': 'Xiaoying Yang'}, {'authorId': '15041689', 'name': 'Guoyun Wan'}, {'authorId': '2026825065', 'name': 'Hongli Chen'}, {'authorId': '49347171', 'name': 'Qiqing Zhang'}, {'authorId': '7708669', 'name': 'Yinsong Wang'}]",113,2020,6250a1d8f5f02b2c68a8cfabe7daba91a5ccacf0,"Metastasis is one of the main causes of failure in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Immunotherapy brings hope and opportunity to solve this challenge, while its clinical applications are greatly inhibited by the tumor immunosuppressive environment. Here, an intelligent biomimetic nanoplatform was designed based on dendritic large-pore mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DLMSNs) for suppressing metastatic TNBC by combining photothermal ablation and immune remodeling. Taking advantage of the ordered large-pore structure and easily chemically modified property of DLMSNs, the copper sulfide (CuS) nanoparticles with high photothermal conversion efficiency were in situ deposited inside the large pores of DLMSNs, and the immune adjuvant resiquimod (R848) was loaded controllably. A homogenous cancer cell membrane was coated on the surfaces of these DLMSNs, followed by conjugation with the anti-PD-1 peptide AUNP-12 through a polyethylene glycol linker with an acid-labile benzoic-imine bond. The thus-obtained AM@DLMSN@CuS/R848 was applied to holistically treat metastatic TNBC in vitro and in vivo. The data showed that AM@DLMSN@CuS/R848 had a high TNBC-targeting ability and induced efficient photothermal ablation on primary TNBC tumors under 980 nm laser irradiation. Tumor antigens thus generated and increasingly released R848 by response to the photothermal effect, combined with AUNP-12 detached from AM@DLMSN@CuS/R848 in the weakly acidic tumor microenvironment, synergistically exerted tumor vaccination, and T lymphocyte activation functions on immune remodeling to prevent TNBC recurrence and metastasis. Taken together, this study provides an intelligent biomimetic nanoplatform to enhance therapeutic outcomes in metastatic TNBC."
