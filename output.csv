AI and IoT, Big Data, block chains have enhanced the ways that diseases are monitored, vaccinations are administered and emergency responses are coordinated. Issues like the infrastructure constraints, privacy issues and variability in technological implementation graduality’s limit the extent to which these technologies can be scaled up in U.S. public health systems. Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of technological improvement on the improvement of the public health monitoring systems in United States. It assesses the utilization of superior technologies and considers the observed enhancement of general health status together with the problems identified in the application of technologies. Methods: A quantitative cross-sectional survey was filled by 400 participants from the PH and technology workers working throughout the USA in the public health sector. Community and purposive sampling techniques were used and data were self-administered from the participants through an online structured questionnaire. The survey included questions about participants’ degrees of awareness of AI, IoTs, Big Data and blockchain, concerning their applicability to public health surveillance and the potential challenges to their application. Descriptive statistics, chi-square, independent sample t test, one way analysis of variance, Pearson correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis were conducted in SPSS V 26. Results: The current study revealed that the use of AI, IoT, Big Data and blockchain technologies has accelerated the enhancement of public health surveillance, including disease detection and vaccination management. Awareness of these technologies was directly related to perceived impact on public health to the extent of r = 0.75, p < 0.001. Other issues like lack of funding, lack of technical knowledge and issues surrounding privacy were cited as major reasons for inadequate scaling up. Conclusion: The results point out that new technology has a potential for advancing the system for monitor public health in the United States but there are some barriers. Challenges that prevent expansion and growth of these technologies include inadequate infrastructure, funding and data protection must be overcome in order to enhance the efficiency of the technologies to deliver on their intended health benefits. More work is necessary to expand understanding of longevity of these phenomena and ways of preventing these challenges."

This study explored domestic waste collectors’ perceptions of occupational safety and self-reported health issues in a city in Ghana using a phenomenological qualitative research design. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were held with 64 domestic waste collectors from two waste companies. The transcribed data were imported into NVivo 11.0 software (QSR International, Burlington, MA, USA) for coding, and a content analysis was applied to analyze all the transcribed data using the processes of induction and deduction. The consensual views from the domestic waste collectors showed the waste-company employers’ non-interest in the domestic waste collectors’ occupational safety and health. Poor communication from employers to domestic waste collectors and huge workloads were identified as the causes of the poor implementation of occupational safety practices, which exposed the domestic waste collectors to occupational health hazards. The domestic waste collectors reported that they suffered from occupational injuries, psychosocial disorders, work-related stress, and frequent burnout. The domestic waste collectors adopted coping strategies, such as self-medication, to deal with these occupational hazards, since most of them were not covered by guaranteed health insurance. In addition, the study revealed the non-compliance and non-enforcement of occupational health and safety policies by the employers to guide health and safety training and practices among the domestic waste collectors. In conclusion, the findings suggest that DWCs are exposed to occupational safety and health hazards in their work. Waste-company employers should extend welfare benefits to DWCs, such as health insurance and social security benefits, to ensure their security, health, and well-being. The findings could inform the design of intervention programs and policies to guide training and practices for domestic waste collectors."
The Role of Anthropology in India's Public Health,"[{'authorId': '52482056', 'name': 'M. Gore'}]",1,2023,fcfcfbd00389aab86fa890aafc434911a85cea8c,"
Conducting research on healthcare systems, policy implementation and the impact of health programmes can systematically identify the gaps and challenges in public health service delivery in India. Anthropology is particularly useful for so doing, but the role of anthropologists in health policy and planning needs recognition in India, as they can evaluate the effectiveness of interventions through a cultural lens, informing the development of evidence-based policies. The USA and Europe are more advanced in the use of anthropology in public health, due to their established academic programmes, robust research funding and infrastructure, and effective integration into public health institutions. Anthropological analysis and intervention has the capacity to improve Indian public health practice, particularly in terms of inclusivity and diversity issues."

Cassel'}]",18,2017,8004c51c6963eec76fbd9505822f1f412039f2b7,"Abstract Delivering optimal and equitable palliative care is an international challenge. There are few cross-national comparisons examining challenges in expanding palliative care along public health lines. This paper presents a critical review of palliative care in the USA and England, which share similar challenges but have different contexts of healthcare. Beyond some obvious differences in the organisation of palliative care, a set of underlying common issues can be identified. A key tension in both is balancing attention ‘downstream’ in the dying phase, as well as ‘upstream’ earlier in the course of serious illness. In both, the dominant models of palliative care provision have resulted in excellent care towards the end of life for some patients, but there remain major deficiencies in care for the majority. England has a National Strategy for End-of-life care; the US has no equivalent, although a number of influential agencies have published statements. Achieving a public health approach in palliative care requires international consensus on the meaning and target population of palliative care, replacement of prognosis based understandings of entitlement to palliative care with a needs-based approach and development of an evidence base for cost-effective partnerships between providers across the specialist–generalist divide."

RoC covers several essential topics concerning environmental, occupational, and pharmaceutical agents that are known to be, or reasonably anticipated to be carcinogenic to humans. To promote the highest exploitation by its potential users, several RoC aspects and features were put together into one article. For doing so, a comprehensive description is provided regarding RoC history, scope, general features, listing criteria, contents, handbook, and website. Secondary and tertiary aims for this work were (a) to point out some improvement opportunities for the RoC, and (b) to discuss pending issues in regulatory science and cancer hazard assessments. In this regard, for agents classified as probably, likely, reasonably anticipated, possibly or suspected to be a human carcinogen, there is a lack of quantitative knowledge concerning the likelihood of those agents actually being carcinogenic to humans. Elucidating these probabilities is necessary, because the duration of current regulations and the arrival of new acts may depend on it. On the other hand, there is a dramatic imbalance in priorities toward carcinogens, compared with non‐carcinogens, in current cancer hazard identification programs. That vision may ignore that the availability on the market of chemicals classified as probably not carcinogenic to humans can also be important for the employment, alimentation, economy, quality of life of consumers, and human health."
Public health responses to the opioid crisis in North America,"[{'authorId': '143769246', 'name': 'T. Kerr'}]",41,2019,5c72f90daec04c68e98b854d1e699068e0a3f4a0,"The opioid overdose epidemic in North America remains among the most challenging public health issues of recent times. Sadly, all evidence points to a worsening of the epidemic,1 2 despite growing investment in responses that span policy and legislative changes, scale-up of evidence-based overdose interventions, and the implementation and evaluation of novel interventions. This has prompted concerns about what is and what is not being done to address this epidemic that has resulted in reductions in life expectancy in both the USA and Canada.

Given the well-described problem of the overprescribing of opioids for pain, governments and medical bodies have sought to reduce opioid prescribing through guideline development, physician education and monitoring efforts. While the rate of prescribing in the USA dropped from a high of 81.3 per 100 persons in 2012 to 58.5 per 100 persons in 2017,3 the death rate attributable to opioids continues to rise, and prescription opioid misuse has remained fairly stable since 2010.3 While this result may seem unexpected, it is not entirely surprising given observed transitions from prescription opioid to heroin use in the USA, as well as evidence from Canada indicating that many individuals acquire heroin or diverted opioids from drug markets when denied opioids from physicians.4 These dynamics are consistent with evidence from a range of settings indicating that when access to one substance is restricted, most individuals will transition to using an alternative, which in many cases will be more dangerous than standardised doses of prescription opioids.

While many have attributed the overdose crisis to opioid prescribing, this is an obvious oversimplification of this epidemic. There is now clear evidence of an increasing role of illicitly manufactured opioids, such as fentanyl and related analogues, in the continued rise in overdose deaths. In the USA, overdose deaths attributable to …"

Canada recently introduced a public health-based regulatory framework for non-medical cannabis. This review sought to identify a comprehensive set of indicators to evaluate the public health and safety impact of cannabis regulation in Canada, and to explore the ways in which these indicators may be expected to change in the era of legal non-medical cannabis.


APPROACH
Five scientific databases were searched to compile a list of cannabis-related issues of interest to public health and safety. A set of indicators was developed based on topics and themes that emerged. Preliminary evidence from other jurisdictions in the USA and Canada that have legalised medical and/or non-medical cannabis (e.g. Colorado, Washington) was summarised for each indicator, wherever possible.


KEY FINDINGS
In total, 28 indicators were identified under five broad themes: public safety; cannabis use trends; other substance use trends; cardiovascular and respiratory health; and mental health and cognition. Preliminary trends from other legalised jurisdictions reveal little consensus regarding the effect of cannabis legalisation on public health and safety harms and an emerging body of evidence to support potential benefits (e.g. reductions in opioid use and overdose).


IMPLICATIONS
In addition to indicators of commonly discussed challenges (e.g. cannabis-related hospitalisations, cannabis-impaired driving), this review led to the recommendation of several indicators to monitor for possible public health and safety improvements.


CONCLUSION
In preparing a comprehensive public health and safety monitoring and evaluation system for cannabis regulation, this review underscores the importance of not only measuring the possible risks but also the potential benefits."

Purpose
Nations such as the USA are investing in technologies such as electronic health records in order to collect, store and transfer information across boundaries of health care, public health and research. Health information brokers such as health care providers, public health departments and university researchers function as “access points” to manage relationships between the public and the health system. The relationship between the public and health information brokers is influenced by trust; and this relationship may predict the trust that the public has in the health system as a whole, which has implications for public trust in the system, and consequently, legitimacy of involved institutions, under circumstances of health information data sharing in the future. This paper aims to discuss these issues.


Design/methodology/approach
In this study, the authors aimed to examine characteristics of trustors (i.e. the public) that predict trust in health information brokers; and further, to identify the factors that influence trust in brokers that also predict system trust. The authors developed a survey that was administered to US respondents in 2014 using GfK’s nationally representative sample, with a final sample of 1,011 participants and conducted ordinary least squares regression for data analyses.


Findings
Results suggest that health care providers are the most trusted information brokers of those examined. Beliefs about medical deceptive behavior were negatively associated with trust in each of the information brokers examined; however, psychosocial factors were significantly associated with trust in brokers, suggesting that individual attitudes and beliefs are influential on trust in brokers. Positive views of information sharing and the expectation of benefits of information sharing for health outcomes and health care quality are associated with system trust.


Originality/value
This study suggests that demonstrating the benefits and value of information sharing could be beneficial for building public trust in the health system; however, trust in brokers of information are variable across the public; that is, knowledge, attitudes and beliefs are associated with the level of trust different individuals have in various health information brokers – suggesting that the need for a personalized approach to building trust.

As a tribal entity, the AWWWA faces additional challenges, including the complex jurisdictional issues affecting all phases of our work, lack of authority to create water districts, and additional legal and regulatory gaps—especially with regards to environmental protection. Despite these obstacles, the AWWWA and Crow Tribe have successfully upgraded much of the local water and wastewater infrastructure. We find that ensuring safe public drinking water for tribal and other disadvantaged U.S. communities will require comprehensive, community-engaged approaches across a broad range of stakeholders to successfully address these complex legal, regulatory, policy, community capacity, and financial challenges."
From Opioid Pain Management to Opioid Crisis in the USA: How Can Public-Private Partnerships Help?,"[{'authorId': '35123071', 'name': 'Larissa Bolliger'}, {'authorId': '40642450', 'name': 'Hilde Stevens'}]",8,2019,f52e695164d319308feb2d697532edc431f8fb91,"The current opioid crisis in the USA arose from (at first) successful opioid pain management in three waves, starting in the'90s. Today, USA patients consume opioid drugs on a massive scale. Considering their potential for tolerance, as well as their potential for lethality in relatively small overdose, the overuse of opioids form an urgent threat to public health in the USA. Since the opioid crisis is a complex phenomenon, several stakeholders are needed to tackle the problem. Both public and private stakeholders should collaborate, e.g., in Public-Private Partnerships. Those collaborations should focus on different aspects related to the opioid crisis such as medical and societal (e.g., pain management process, including addressing opioid use disorders), as well as economical and regulatory issues (e.g., incentivizing the search for alternative non-addictive pain medication and banning aggressive marketing tactics used by the pharmaceutical industry). Additionally, collaborations should cover interdisciplinary education and training of various healthcare actors involved. In conclusion, interdisciplinary collaboration on the various opioid abuse-related aspects is urgently needed to tackle the opioid crisis in the USA."

 As the tourism industry faces a long road to full recovery in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study utilized a scenario planning method to depict widely contrasting conditions in which tourism recovery in the U.S. state of Arizona will need to navigate. To collect data, we held a scenario planning session in June 2020 with 24 participants representing various stakeholder groups, such as public land management agencies, tourism businesses, destination management organizations, and a multidisciplinary panel of experts from the fields of public health, transportation, travel and tourism, and epidemiology. Six critical drivers of tourism recovery were identified, which included public health status, performance of the economy, destination availability, government policy, consumer confidence, and leadership messaging. Among these six critical drivers, public health status and performance of the economy were determined to be the two most influential and most uncertain determinants of tourism recovery and were used to develop four plausible scenarios consisting of a worst-case, best-case and two mid-level scenarios. As social inequities and economic and public health devastation appeared in the scenarios, the crucial methodological contributions and implications for tourism stakeholders, including destination communities, destination managers and local governments, are discussed."

Animal studies indicate that exposure to hormonally active agents leads to this type of developmental effect and related later life susceptibilities. In this review we describe current science, public health issues, and research recommendations for evaluating MG development. Data sources: The Mammary Gland Evaluation and Risk Assessment Workshop was convened in Oakland, California, USA, 16–17 November 2009, to integrate the expertise and perspectives of scientists, risk assessors, and public health advocates. Interviews were conducted with 18 experts, and seven laboratories conducted an MG slide evaluation exercise. Workshop participants discussed effects of gestational and early life exposures to hormonally active agents on MG development, the relationship of these developmental effects to lactation and cancer, the relative sensitivity of MG and other developmental end points, the relevance of animal models to humans, and methods for evaluating MG effects. Synthesis: Normal MG development and MG carcinogenesis demonstrate temporal, morphological, and mechanistic similarities among test animal species and humans. Diverse chemicals, including many not considered primarily estrogenic, alter MG development in rodents. Inconsistent reporting methods hinder comparison across studies, and relationships between altered development and effects on lactation or carcinogenesis are still being defined. In some studies, altered MG development is the most sensitive endocrine end point. Conclusions: Early life environmental exposures can alter MG development, disrupt lactation, and increase susceptibility to breast cancer. Assessment of MG development should be incorporated in chemical test guidelines and risk assessment."

The World Health Report 2006 identified the need to improve the quality of public health education. There are various mechanisms and bodies that look after accreditation issues in several countries. The Council on Education for Public Health in the USA assists in the accreditation of schools of public health, as well as public health programmes. The Australian Network of Academic Public Health Institutions is actively engaged in discussions to improve the quality of its programme and institutions. In Europe, the European Agency for Accreditation in Public Health Education is responsible for accreditation. The South-East Asia Public Health Education Institutes Network facilitates accreditation of public health education in the region. In India, public health education varies across institutes. India needs an accreditation system to ensure that public health education is of the desired quality. Certain initiatives, such as conferences, consultation and the Calcutta Declaration, have been taken in the past two decades. However, the ideas mooted have yet to be translated into reality. The broad framework for accreditation may entail an institutional self-assessment against set standards, preparation of a database, cataloguing, and site visits by a peer team. There is a need for an apical body with all stakeholders participating in the process. Accreditation has specific benefits, but there are critical challenges as well. For example, the autonomy of the institutions needs to be protected, the accreditation bodies should exhibit professionalism and substantial financial resources are required. Before tackling specific criteria for accreditation, it is necessary to define a collective vision for schools of public health in India."

This work presents the responses from two surveys, a random-sample telephone survey of more than 1500 residents and a mail survey targeting owners of parcels with 10 or more acres of forest. These surveys were conducted in three counties (Wallowa, Union, and Baker) in northeast Oregon, USA. We analyze these survey data using structural equation models in order to assess how individual characteristics and understanding of forest management issues affect perceptions about forest conditions and risks associated with declining forest health on public lands. We test whether forest understanding is informed by background, beliefs, and experiences, and whether as an intervening variable it is associated with views about forest conditions on publicly managed forests. Individual background characteristics such as age, gender and county of residence have significant direct or indirect effects on our measurement of understanding. Controlling for background factors, we found that forest owners with higher self-assessed understanding, and more education about forest management, tend to hold more pessimistic views about forest conditions. Based on our results we argue that self-assessed understanding, interest in learning, and willingness to engage in extension activities together have leverage to affect perceptions about the risks posed by declining forest conditions on public lands, influence land owner actions, and affect support for public policies. These results also have broader implications for management of forested landscapes on public and private lands amidst changing demographics in rural communities across the Inland Northwest where migration may significantly alter the composition of forest owner goals, understanding, and support for various management actions."

Attitudes and perceptions may differ by type of energy, as well as the recipient of the harm. A post-Fukushima survey of students and others in a university community in central New Jersey was conducted to determine how much people worried about the potential effects of different energy types (nuclear, chemical, coal, hydroelectric, solar, wind, and gas), which aspect they worried about (public health, workers, and the environment), and which form they thought the USA should further develop. Ratings for worry varied significantly by energy type and receptor type. In general, worry was greater for all aspects of chemical, coal, nuclear, and gas, and significantly less for hydro, solar, and wind. Worry was generally higher for exposure from the plant, exposure from food and water, exposure to workers, and exposure for wildlife than for either transportation issues or exposure from everyday occurrences. The same exposures (or targets) were rated for each energy source. The greatest worry for each energy type was as follows: (1) nuclear exposure to radiation in food, although worker exposure and exposure from the plant were very close, (2) chemical exposure was from accidents in the plant, (3) coal was from harmful effects of mercury on wildlife, (4) hydro was from contamination of drinking water, (5) solar was from harmful UV radiation exposure in wildlife, (6) wind was from mortality of birds due to wind turbines, and (7) gas was from harmful gas exposure to wildlife. Overall, the highest rated features in terms of worry (four of seven energy forms) were for wildlife. The survey population believed that wind, solar, tidal, and hydro power should be developed further, and coal should be developed the least."

The strengths (e.g., environmental management, biodiversity, heat island mitigation) and challenges (e.g., greenwashing, green gentrification) of such projects are well-documented. Additional research on the relationship between these projects and various social factors (e.g., public perceptions, feelings, and mental health and well-being) is necessary to better understand how people adapt to said projects while struggling to navigate other more pressing socioeconomic issues, especially in communities facing environmental injustice and health inequity. In this article, we focus on one aspect of biophilic urban planning—green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) (e.g., rain gardens, bio-swales, pervious pavements, and wildflower meadows)—in Waterfront South, a post-industrial neighborhood in Camden, NJ, USA, where residents have faced environmental injustices for decades. Our qualitative analysis of in-depth semi-structured interviews of sixteen residents offered a thorough insight into their perceptions and emotions regarding different types of urban GSI projects. Residents acknowledge the many benefits that GSI offers to combat the neighborhood’s social and environmental injustices, but they are cautious about the possibility of some projects prompting new issues and concerns within the community. Our findings reveal potential implications in GSI planning, research, and practice in this neighborhood and similar urban places elsewhere that have yet to undergo gentrification."

Romero'}]",26,2021,d7ccdbe5e99ff6f1e487e78e37de332f20cbc8d5,"Simple Summary Some cockroaches that live within and around human environments are considered pests of public health importance because they can carry and transfer human pathogenic microorganisms to food and food handling surfaces; infestations could result in cockroach allergen-induced allergic sensitization and asthma in sensitized individuals. In addition, cockroaches can cause psychological stress and stigma in people living in infested locations. Historically, cockroach control has been based on the use of insecticide sprays. However, in certain situations, sole dependence on insecticides for cockroach control can lead to issues such as pesticide resistance evolution and raises public concern due to the impact on the environment and human health. To overcome these problems, the use of reduced risk insecticide options (e.g., baits) and their combined use with alternative tactics is recommended. This review aims to examine alternative tactics used for cockroach control, with emphasis on those that are proven to be efficacious, and/or have potential for their incorporation in management programs of important domestic and peridomestic cockroaches in the USA. Remarkable examples of successful cockroach control programs are those that educate the public, promote cleanliness and hygiene, use traps to monitor infestation levels and utilize insecticide baits. Abstract Effective control of domestic and peridomestic cockroaches requires integrated approaches that emphasize concurrent use of chemicals with alternative control tactics. An integrated pest management (IPM) approach is particularly justified in environments where satisfactory cockroach control cannot be achieved due to multiple factors including development of insecticide aversion and resistance in some cockroach species, and poor sanitation or structural issues that foster infestations. While a flurry of research effort has been devoted to study alternative tactics for cockroach control, only a few of them have been evaluated in the context of IPM programs. This review focuses on examining studies on alternative tactics that are proven efficacious, economical, and logistically feasible for their inclusion in IPM programs for important domestic and peridomestic cockroaches in the USA. Management programs that educate the public on cockroach biology, behavior, and the importance of sanitation; use of traps to monitor infestation levels; apply targeted low impact insecticides such as baits, have demonstrated a greater success for effective and sustainable control of cockroaches when compared to an insecticide-only approach. Incorporation of other alternative control methods to IPM programs will require more applied research that validates their use in real-world scenarios and demonstrates their cost-effectiveness."

Yet, the mental health impacts of temperature have been understudied. Research has shown that the environment can create circumstances that exacerbate mental health issues. This may be particularly challenging for some of the fastest growing cities, located in hot, dry climates. Given the theoretical relationship between air temperature and mental health, we seek to measure the association between temperature and schizophrenia hospital admissions in an arid urban climate and quantify the associated public health burden. We collected 86,672 hospitalization records for schizophrenia from 2006 to 2014 in Maricopa County, Arizona, USA. Using a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM), we tested for a statistical association between temperature and schizophrenia hospital admissions after controlling for year, season, weekends, and holidays. We calculated the cumulative attributable risk of nighttime temperature on schizophrenia for the entire dataset as well as among demographic subgroups. The relative risk of schizophrenia hospital admissions increased with both high and low temperatures. Statistical models using daily minimum temperature were more strongly associated with hospitalization than those using mean or maximum. Schizophrenia hospital admissions increased on days with minimum temperatures above 30 °C and below 3 °C, with some subgroups experiencing higher rates of hospitalization. The total fraction of schizophrenia hospital admissions attributable to non-optimal minimum temperature is 3.45 % (CI: -4.91-10.80 %) and high minimum temperature is 0.28 % (CI: -1.18-1.78 %). We found that non-whites and males appear to be at a slightly increased risk than the general population, although there did not appear to be a statistically significant difference. A conservative estimate of healthcare costs annually from non-optimal temperature attributed schizophrenia hospitalization is $1.95 million USD. Therefore, nighttime cooling strategies and efforts could increase the accessibility of shelters to reduce overnight exposure to extreme air temperature."

Walkable streets and proximity to green space have long been believed to promote active lifestyles in cities, which contribute to positive health outcomes among residents. Traditionally, urban environmental metrics were calculated at the area level to describe the physical environment of neighborhoods. However, considering the fact that streets are the basic unit for human activities in cities, it is important to understand how the streetscape environment can influence human health conditions. In this study, we investigated the influence of street greenery and walkability on body mass index in Cleveland, Ohio, USA. Different from the area level and overhead view greenery metrics, we used the green view index calculated from the Google Street View to represent the amount of street greenery. The Walk Score was used to indicate the walkability of neighborhoods also at the street level. Statistical analysis results show that the Walk Score has a more significant association with decreased BMI for males than females and the street greenery has a more significant association with decreased BMI for females than males in Cleveland, Ohio.

Estimates of the lifetime prevalence for this disorder range from 5–17% of the population in the USA (3–4). However a MEDLINE trawl of two hundred and seventy-five publications on mental health issues in Caribbean people revealed a paucity of written material on depression in the region. In the Global Burden of Disease Report, it is estimated that depression was the fourth leading cause of burden among all diseases and that it accounted for 4.4% of the Total Disability Adjusted Life Years (5). An important characteristic feature of the longitudinal course of major depression is the frequent co-occurrence with other illnesses. Numerous studies have examined the prevalence of co-morbid depression. Robin et al (3) and Wittchen et al (6) have shown that there is high co-morbidity between major depression and other psychiatric disorders. Much has been written on the risk factors; Blazer et al have shown that there was a stronger correlation with younger age, lower level of education and lower income in co-morbid depression in contrast to pure depression in which the major potential risk for pure depression was non-black race/ ethnicity (7). Studies have shown that in persons diagnosed with diabetes mellitus the prevalence of depression range from 6.1% – 60.7% (8). In a meta-analysis of 42 studies on co-morbid depression in adults with diabetes, Anderson et al concluded that the presence of diabetes increases the risk of depression they also concluded that the variation in prevalence estimates was due to clinical and methodological factors (9). A number of epidemiological studies have established a clear relationship between depression and cardiovascular diseases (10–13) with the prevalence of major depression in post myocardial infarction ranging from 15%–20% (14, 15). Depression, coexisting with other medical conditions, has poorer outcome in terms of quality of life and social and physical functioning (16, 17) and it is associated with increased morbidity and mortality (18, 19). In a study of patients with myocardial infarction, Frasure-Smith et al showed that 17% of patients had died by six months compared with 3% for non-depressed patients (14). In patients with breast cancer depression is associated with a reduced 5-year survival (19).

A search was conducted in the WoS, SCOPUS, PsychINFO, Medline, Academic Search Ultimate, ProQuest, and PubPsych databases, complemented by a manual search on relevant websites and in the reference lists of the selected studies. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of group-based psychodrama psychotherapy were included. The Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) tool was adopted to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. The search identified 14 RCTs and one quasi-RCT evaluating the effects of group-based psychodrama psychotherapy. The total number of participants in the studies was 642 people. Seven studies were conducted in Turkey, two in the USA, two in Finland, one in Canada, one in Brazil, one in Italy, and one in Iran. The heterogeneity of the issues analyzed indicates that psychodrama improves the symptoms associated with a wide range of problems. Despite psychodrama’s long history, most clinical trials in this field have been published this century, which suggests not only that this psychotherapeutic practice remains relevant today but also that it continues to attract substantial interest among the scientific community. Nevertheless, further research efforts are required to understand its potential benefits for psychosocial well-being."
Violence and Public Health,"[{'authorId': '143974917', 'name': 'A.

There is now a wide consensus that law enforcement cannot by itself provide an answer. Solutions are needed from other disciplines, including public health. Preventing violence demands not only a long-term commitment but also a comprehensive set of strategies and partnerships that are not focused solely on aggressive responses1• Many examples of increasing violence could be given, from crime statistics/, as in Table 1, to the need to provide training for doctors (among others) on the avoidance and management of potentially agressive situations-. The cost is huge. In 1985 in the USA there were 20.8 violent deaths and 110.4 hospital admissions for violence per 100000 population, with an estimated total cost for the whole country of US$ 8.26 billion"", Reducing violence is a practicable aim which we should be trying to achieve."

The situation elsewhere in the world is then briefly covered with reference to these systems. They have subtle differences in several areas and the key issues of quality systems, product standards, effectiveness and post-market controls are explored in seperate chapters. This is followed by a discussion of global harmonisation and appendices reproducing some related documents from the Global Harmonisation Task Force. The late Gordon Higson was perhaps uniquely placed to write such a book due to his personal perspective at the sharp end of many of the developments that he discusses. He has drawn together information which was previously scattered over a substantial number of sources and often difficult to locate. Unlike the various papers which have been published previously, this book gives a fair and unbiased comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches. The overall result is an informed text written with a firm conviction that things are heading in the right direction and a clear vision of what that direction is. It is supported by copious references to source documents and the websites of key organisations. Anyone who has struggled to understand why apparently divergent approaches to medical device safety appear to have been taken in different countries or agonised over product import/export issues will find this an enlightening read. The style is such that what could have been a very dry topic is very flowing and informative. This book is an essential read for anyone involved with the design, marketing or regulatory affairs aspects of medical devices. It should be in the reference library of all medical device regulators and manufacturers (including university and hospital clinical engineering departments)."

Methods This position paper is the result of a working group consisting of researchers from the EU, Turkey and the USA, who have discussed the issue over the course of six months (October 2018-April 2019), meeting both online and face-to-face on several occasions. Results The lack of a common theoretical framework of PE hinders it from becoming an established part of occupational and public health research. There are also issues regarding operationalization in surveys and registers. Further, previous research on PE and health suffers from methodological limitations including inadequate study designs and biased assessments of exposure and outcomes. PE is highly dependent on contextual factors and cross-country comparison has proven very difficult. We also point to the uneven social distribution of PE, ie, higher prevalence among women, immigrants, young and low educated. We propose a theoretical framework for understanding precarious employment as a multidimensional construct. Conclusions A generally accepted multidimensional definition of PE should be the highest priority. Future studies would benefit from improved exposure assessment, temporal resolution, and accounting for confounders, as well as testing possible mechanisms, eg, by adopting multi-level and intersectional analytical approaches in order to understand the complexity of PE and its relation to health."
Growth of Global Health Spending Share in Low and Middle Income Countries,"[{'authorId': '144685067', 'name': 'M. Jakovljevic'}, {'authorId': '4013100', 'name': 'T.

These public health victories came at the cost of huge increase in health spending. The USA, the largest health care market where total health expenditure (THE) grew from 4% of GDP to 15%, may serve as an example of such changes. The secular trend consisting of rising wages and incomes constitutes major factor in the rising resources dedicated to the medical care. Business cycle booms and recessions affected health care spending slowly and with a significant lag. In this sense health expenditures should not be compared to short term, quarterly or yearly fluctuations in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) but correlates well to "" smoothed "" income over the previous 3–6 years (Getzen, 1990). Growth of health expenditure is driven by several underlying issues: population birth rates, per-capita income, inflation and so called "" excess growth "" that is mostly explained by medical technology advances or increased patient demand for services. This "" excess growth "" is responsible for raising the share of health care in national GDP, and thus challenging fiscal sustainability. Evidence of excess growth is seen in health insurance premiums that persistently rise faster than tax revenues or wages. Isolated excess cost growth was the key underlying reason for the surmountable surge in health care costs visible in the United States since the late 1950s. Unlike the contemporary post WWII era, previous historical records testify of stable medical costs of about 4% of GDP from 1929 to the late 1950s. U.S. Census records of employment in clinical medicine and published consumer expenditure evidence from 1850–1950 show that these costs were mostly keeping pace with wages. If they were slightly exceeding wages it was only about 0.5% annually thus it took more than a century for them to double, much slower than the quadrupling from 1960 to 2000 (Getzen, 2000). Major causes of such a sudden rise in health expenditures were huge economic development, distinctively extended longevity, control of contagious diseases, rising availability of income used to fund research in medicine, effective financing instruments, and ultimately significant discoveries in medical technologies that supported public willingness for further investment into potential novel biological drugs, implants, robotic surgery, radiation therapy, organ transplants, and other wonder technologies (Getzen, 2014).

A community-based participatory research approach was used to engage a diverse sample of 75 behaviourally bisexual men (25 White, 25 Black and 25 Latino). Semi-structured interviews were conducted and standard qualitative analysis procedures were used to explore data from the 25 Latino participants. Men described their unique migration experiences as behaviourally bisexual men in this area of the USA, as well as related sexual risk behaviours and health concerns. Lack of culturally congruent public health and community resources for behaviourally bisexual men in the Midwestern USA were identified as significant barriers. As in other studies, familial and community relationships were significant for the participants, especially in terms of the decision to disclose or not disclose their bisexuality. Additionally, alcohol and other drugs were often used while engaging in sexual behaviours particularly with male and transgender, as well as female, partners.

A plethora of data suggests there are many roots to the issue and what to do about it. The rise of childhood obesity and the growing incidence of adult endocrine diseases like type 2 diabetes mellitus in paediatric populations are the most concerning. One of the solutions that aims to tackle health and food justice issues is the Farm-to-School programme (FTSP), which helps bring local fruit and vegetables (FVs) to schools and associated nutrition-related programmes. In the USA, a significant expansion of FTSPs has happened since the early 2000s. Numerous economic, social and nutritional benefits of these programmes have been documented, and various methodologies have been used to elucidate the benefits and barriers. Method: This paper reviews the multifaceted strengths of FTSPs including health, institutional and farm-related benefits. The paper also discusses federal- and state-level environment and the obstacles to FTSP implementation. Conclusion: FTSPs offer a comprehensive way to strengthen childhood nutrition education and stimulate local communities economically and socially. FTSPs increase the purchase of locally produced food items, resulting in higher incomes for small farmers. FTSPs have also increased community engagement and new opportunities for farming businesses. In sum, FTSPs can be considered a boon for local schools, producers, communities and better health outcomes for school-age children. Teaching children about food literacy could prove beneficial for supporting their self-efficacy regarding foods and encouraging lifetime healthy dietary behaviours."

The purpose of this paper is to discuss five domains impacted by the transformation of correctional mental health care in the USA: public health, public safety, legal obligations, fiscal responsibility and ethical standards, as well as critical issues such as administrative segregation, suicide prevention and reentry planning.


DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH
In the last four decades, the USA has seen a sizable growth in its criminal justice system and corrections population. It has also seen reductions in civil and community-based mental health care. Persons with mental disabilities have come to represent a highly disproportional segment of the corrections population. The paper discusses the implications and underlying causes of these developments as well as recent responses to them.


FINDINGS
This set of circumstances is starting to change the mission of correctional health services from crisis intervention and suicide prevention to include preparation for the inmate's almost inevitable return to the community.


ORIGINALITY/VALUE
Such changes have led to further developments in correctional mental health care, in particular, policy designed to treat mental illness, reduce its destructive outcomes such as suicide, and facilitate successful reentry into the community in attempts to reduce recidivism and improve clinical outcomes. Mental health care professionals working within corrections have likewise faced ethical challenges in effectuating treatment."

Their burden is projected to increase over the next several decades. Additional therapies for mental problems are in urgent need worldwide due to the limitations and costs of existing healthcare approaches. Essential oil aromatherapy can provide a cost‐effective and safe treatment for many mental problems. This pilot study observed the effects of bergamot essential oil inhalation on mental health and well‐being, as measured by the Positive and Negative Affect Scale, in a mental‐health treatment center located in Utah, USA. Fifty‐seven eligible participants (50 women, age range: 23–70 years) were included for analysis. Fifteen minutes of bergamot essential oil exposure improved participants' positive feelings compared with the control group (17% higher). Unexpectedly, more participants participated in experimental periods rather than control periods, suggesting even brief exposure to essential oil aroma may make people more willing to enroll in clinical trials. This study provides preliminary evidence of the efficacy and safety of bergamot essential oil inhalation on mental well‐being in a mental health treatment center, suggesting that bergamot essential oil aromatherapy can be an effective adjunct treatment to improve individuals' mental health and well‐being. © 2017 The Authors.

However, in the recent past, USA has been signing regional and bilateral trade agreements with developing countries. While developing countries are lured to such agreements because of the opening up of trade and trade concessions, however, conditions of such trade especially those binding the intellectual property rights of the goods concerning USA are stricter and broader and thereby become more powerful than the WTO Agreement governing the countries. Particularly, concerns have been raised about patentability criteria, data exclusivity with potential to extend monopoly status of the newly introduced drugs and delay the entry of generic drugs, which would obviously keep the prices beyond the reach of developing countries thereby making access to drugs difficult.

In 2003-2005, a study was undertaken to document the impacts of CBPR on healthy public policy in the US. From an initial review of 80 partnership efforts, 10 were selected as best capturing the range and diversity of projects meeting the study criteria, and were the subject of in-depth case study analysis. This article presents and analyzes one of these cases, a collaboration between researchers at the Indiana University School of Nursing and the Healthy Cities Committee of New Castle, IN, USA. With its action component still underway a decade after the formal study's completion, the partnership was selected to enable an examination of sustainable change through CBPR. Beginning with a participatory door-to-door health survey of 1000 households using a non-probability quota sampling strategy, the project involved community members in many stages of the research process. A smoking rate of twice the national average was among the study findings that helped to galvanize the community into action. A variety of health promoting environmental and 'small p policy' changes were undertaken ranging from a bill restricting indoor smoking in public places to an initiative to develop a system of trails throughout the county to promote physical fitness and decreased reliance on automobiles. This article examines the evolution of the original CBPR partnership, its research methods and findings, and the environmental changes it sought to promote healthier lifestyles. Success factors, barriers and sustainability benchmarks are discussed. The case study offers an example of the potential of CBPR for helping to lay the groundwork for long-term sustainable change in support of healthier communities."

Recent findingsAlthough the exact role of bacteria in chronic rhinosinusitis continues to be debated, the role of MRSA in these patients is even less apparent. When MRSA is involved, there are few to guide treatment. Oral, parenteral, and topical antibiotics are all used in the treatment of sinonasal MRSA. MRSA eradication has been advocated by some; however, there are few data to support the efficacy of eradication. Current treatment regimens by the authors are reviewed.

We aimed to assess the contents and tone of articles on mental health care in the UK print media by comparing them with reporting in the USA and Australia. Two broadsheets from each country were analysed using the Internet for a random 4 months over a 1-year period. The number of articles, their content and the views expressed in them were identified and compared.

RESULTS 

A total of 118 articles on mental health care issues were found. The predominant tone of the articles in all three countries was negative, though there were slightly more positive articles in the USA and Australian media. Positive articles highlighted in the UK media covered mostly medical conferences and research findings.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS 

Efforts to achieve a more positive attitude towards people with mental illnesses in the public, such as anti-stigma campaigns, operate against a background of predominantly negative coverage of mental health care issues in broadsheets. The coverage in the UK may tend to be even less positive than in the USA and Australia. Medical conferences and research findings can, however, be used to promote positive views of mental health care in the media."

News media is an important tool for influencing individual actions and support for public policies to reduce environmental threats; thus, a lack of news coverage of such issues may exacerbate knowledge deficits. This study examines the reporting of health risks and precautionary measures regarding air pollution in national and regional print news. We conducted a content analysis of two national and two local newspapers covering the USA’s most polluted region during a 5-year period. Coders identified information on threat, self-efficacy, protective measures and information sources. Nearly 40% of air pollution news articles mentioned human health risks. Fewer than 10% of news stories about air pollution provided information on the precautionary measures necessary for individuals to take action to mitigate their risk. Local newspapers did not report more threat (Χ2 = 1.931, p = 0.165) and efficacy (Χ2 = 1.118, p = 0.209) information.

However, even before the pandemic, unequal housing access resulted in more than 150 million homeless people worldwide, and more than 22 million new people were added to this inventory for climate-related issues. This homeless population has a counterproductive effect on the social, psychological integration efforts by the community and exposure to other severe health-related issues. Methods: We systematically identified and reviewed 24 articles which met all three requirements we set forth- i. samples include homeless people, ii. focused on public health-related issues among the same group of people, and iii. used geospatial analysis tools and techniques in conducting the research. Result: Our review findings indicated a major disparity in the geographic distribution of the case study locations- all the articles are from six (6) countries- USA (n = 16), Canada (n = 3), UK (n = 2), and one study each from Brazil, Ireland, and South Africa. Majority of the studies used spatial analysis tools to identify the hotspots, clustering and spatial patterns of patient location and distribution. ArcGIS is the most frequently used GIS application, however, studies also used other statistical applications with spatial analysis capabilities. These studies reported relationship between the location of homeless shelters and substance use, discarded needles, different infectious and non-infectious disease clusters. Conclusion: Although, most studies were restricted in analyzing and visualizing the trends, patterns, and disease clusters, geospatial analyses techniques can be used to assess health problems such as disease distributions and associated factors across communities. Moreover, health and services and accessibility concerns could be well addressed by integrating spatial analysis into homelessness-related research. This may facilitate policymaking for health-issues among the homeless people and address health inequities in this vulnerable population."

The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of public participation in addressing these considerations. Design/methodology/approach - The paper employs a comparative case study approach. It explores the experience of four countries - Brazil, England, South Korea and the USA - in making coverage decisions about the antiviral sofosbuvir and involving the public and patients in these decision-making processes. Findings - Issues emerging from public participation ac tivities include the role of the universal right to health in Brazil, the balance between innovation and budget impact in England, the effect of unethical medical practices on public perception in South Korea and the legitimacy of priority-setting processes in the USA. Providing policymakers are receptive to these issues, public participation activities may be re-conceptualized as processes that illuminate policy problems relevant to a particular context, thereby promoting an agenda-setting role for the public. Originality/value - The paper offers an empirical analysis of public involvement in the case of sofosbuvir, where the relevant considerations that bear on priority-setting decisions have been particularly stark. The perspectives that emerge suggest that public participation contributes to raising attention to issues that need to be addressed by policymakers. Public participation activities can thus contribute to setting policy agendas, even if that is not their explicit purpose.

Hence, the combined effects of AP and PE are interesting issues worth exploring. The objective of this study is to review literature involved in AP-PE fields to perform a knowledge-map analysis and explore the collaborations, current hotspots, physiological applications, and future perspectives. Herein, cluster, co-citation, and co-occurrence analysis were applied using CiteSpace and VOSviewer software. The results demonstrated that AP-PE domains have been springing up and in rapid growth since the 21st century. Subsequently, active countries and institutions were identified, and the productive institutions were mainly located in USA, China, UK, Spain, and Canada. Developed countries seemed to be the major promoters. Additionally, subject analysis found that environmental science, public health, and sports medicine were the core subjects, and multidimensional communications were forming. Thereafter, a holistic presentation of reference co-citation clusters was conducted to discover the research topics and trace the development focuses. Youth, elite athletes, and rural population were regarded as the noteworthy subjects. Commuter exposure and moderate aerobic exercise represented the common research context and exercise strategy, respectively. Simultaneously, the research hotspots and application fields were elaborated by keyword co-occurrence distribution. It was noted that physiological adaptations including respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, and mental health were the major themes; oxidative stress and inflammatory response were the mostly referred mechanisms. Finally, several challenges were proposed, which are beneficial to promote the development of the research field. Molecular mechanisms and specific pathways are still unknown and the equilibrium points and dose-effect relationships remain to be further explored. We are highly confident that this study provides a unique perspective to systematically and comprehensively review the pieces of AP-PE research and its related physiological mechanisms for future investigations."
Motivational processes in children's physical activity and health-related quality of life,"[{'authorId': '4553939', 'name': 'Xiangli Gu'}, {'authorId': '4118381', 'name': 'M. Solmon'}]",30,2016,df31fc5e8ab82c36bb2f64dc68b77556c61d93b5,"Background: School physical education (PE) not only offers and promotes health-related physical activity (PA), but also encompasses the promotion and development of health-related well-being such as health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Furthermore, assessing PA and HRQOL have become major issues in pediatric public health and also serve as a major goal of Healthy people 2020. Grounded in the expectancy-value and achievement goal frameworks, the primary purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among the perceptions of motivational climate in PE, expectancy-value beliefs, HRQOL, and PA among elementary children. A secondary purpose was to test whether expectancy-value beliefs mediate the relationship between motivational climate and HRQOL as well as between motivational climate and PA (self-reported PA and pedometer-based PA, respectively). Methods: Participants were 336 elementary children recruited from three public schools in the southeastern USA (Mage = 9.87; 179 girls, 157 boys). The majority of the participants (53.3%) were White students and the remainder (46.7%) including African-American (37.4%), Asian-American (1.5%), Hispanic-American (1.8%) and others (5.9%). Students completed a previously validated questionnaire assessing expectancy-related beliefs and task values toward PE. The 23-item pediatric QOL inventory generic core scale (PedsQLTM 4.0) was used to assess participants’ HRQOL. Children's PA levels were assessed by using a self-reported survey (Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children) and three-day pedometer counts (steps/min during PE). Analysis/Results: Correlational analyses showed that expectancy-related beliefs and task values were positively related to PA and HRQOL. Regression analyses indicated that both mastery and performance motivational climate had a positive effect on children's expectancy beliefs and task values. Mediational analyses were used to evaluate the potential mediational relationships among motivational climate (independent variables: mastery and performance climates), expectancy-value beliefs (mediator: expectancy-value beliefs), and HRQOL and PA (dependent variables: total HRQOL score, self-reported PA and steps/min), respectively. Conclusions: A mastery motivational climate together with high expectancy beliefs has a positive association with HRQOL, which in turn could produce health benefits in the future. Results suggest that a performance motivational climate could be associated with less activity (i.e. lower steps/min) even when students view PE as interesting, important, and useful. One important implication of the study is that by promoting mastery climates and expectancy-value beliefs in PE practitioners can encourage children to engage in PA both in and outside of school, and consequently may influence their quality of life."

In the current era of global or disorganized capitalism the most discussed movements in Europe have been the new social movements (NSMs). In this paper the NSMs are defined and discussed in terms of their actual and potential impact in the health domain. Within a broadly Habermasian framework, a series of rhetorics associated with, and intermittently enacted through, NSMs are identified. This leads to a provisional typology of ‘mobilizing potentials’ characteristic of NSMs. It is suggested that it is the organic bases and flexibility of health-related NSMs, together with their potential to comprise a ‘culture of challenge’ in the public sphere of the lifeworld, which makes them serious political agents for lifeworld de-colonization."

The association between gut microbiota and CRC has been widely studied; however, the link between archaea and CRC has not been sufficiently studied. To investigate the involvement of archaea in colorectal carcinogenesis, we performed a metagenomic analysis of 68 formalin-embedded paraffin fixed tissues from tumoral (n = 33) and healthy mucosa (n = 35) collected from 35 CRC Tunisian patients. We used two DNA extraction methods: Generead DNA FFPE kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) and Chelex. We then sequenced the samples using Illumina Miseq. Interestingly, DNA extraction exclusively using Chelex generated enough DNA for sequencing of all samples. After data filtering and processing, we reported the presence of archaeal sequences, which represented 0.33% of all the reads generated. In terms of abundance, we highlighted a depletion in methanogens and an enrichment in Halobacteria in the tumor tissues, while the correlation analysis revealed a significant association between the Halobacteria and the tumor mucosa (p < 0.05). We reported a strong correlation between Natrialba magadii, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, and tumor tissues, and a weak correlation between Methanococcus voltae and healthy adjacent mucosa. Here, we demonstrated the feasibility of archaeome analysis from formol fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues using simple protocols ranging from sampling to data analysis, and reported a significant association between Halobacteria and tumor tissues in Tunisian patients with CRC. The importance of our study is that it represents the first metagenomic analysis of Tunisian CRC patients’ gut microbiome, which consists of sequencing DNA extracted from paired tumor-adjacent FFPE tissues collected from CRC patients. The detection of archaeal sequences in our samples confirms the feasibility of carrying out an archaeome analysis from FFPE tissues using a simple DNA extraction protocol. Our analysis revealed the enrichment of Halobacteria, especially Natrialba magadii, in tumor mucosa compared to the normal mucosa in CRC Tunisian patients. Other species were also associated with CRC, including Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and Methanococcus voltae, which is a methanogenic archaea; both species were found to be correlated with adjacent healthy tissues."

Individual food choices and eating behaviours are influenced by many interrelated factors which affect the results of nutrition-related public health interventions. While the majority of research based on out-of-home foods comes from Australia, the UK and USA, the same issues (poor dietary habits and increased prevalence of non-communicable disease) are of equal concern for urban centres in developing economies undergoing ‘nutrition transition’ at a global scale. The present narrative review documents key facets, which may influence out-of-home food consumption, drawn from biological, societal, environmental, demographic and psychological spheres. Literature searches were performed and references from relevant papers were used to find supplementary studies. Findings suggest that the strongest determinants of out-of-home food availability are density of food outlets and deprivation within the built environment; however, the association between socio-economic status and out-of-home food consumption has been challenged. In addition, the biological and psychological drives combined with a culture where overweight and obesity are becoming the norm makes it ‘fashionable’ to consume out-of-home food. Other factors, including age group, ethnicity and gender demonstrate contrasting effects and a lack of consensus. It is concluded that further consideration of the determinants of out-of-home food consumption within specific populations is crucial to inform the development of targeted interventions to reduce the impact of out-of-home foods on public health."

Despite considerable initial public support and a strong start, the reform effort was damaged by the cumbersome process, the complexity of the plan itself, and the unfamiliarity of key components such as alliances for pooled buying of health insurance. In addition, the alienation of important interest groups and the loss of presidential initiative in framing the public discussion as a result of international, domestic and personal issues contributed to the failure in developing public consensus. This paper considers an alternative strategy that would have built on the extension of the Medicare program as a way of exploring the possibilities and barriers to achieving health care reform. Such an approach would build on already familiar and popular pre-existing components. The massive losses in the most recent election and large budget cuts planned by the Republican majority makes it unlikely that gaps in insurance or comprehensiveness of coverage will be corrected in the foreseeable future."

Danner'}]",8,2001,1bb07dbd4ed964bad704c65eb680b14534465443,"Abstract The practice of sustainable development requires society to equally and simultaneously address economic enhancement along with actions that offer environmental protection, while also insuring that the most disadvantaged people in our communities are provided the ability to improve their quality of life. The ethnic and class stratification of different societal sectors represents one of the most tenacious forms of inequality in any part of the world. For this reason, where inequities persist in severe forms, ideas about balancing economic development and environmental preservation may be particularly contentious. The primary premise of this paper assumes that without equity considerations economic and environmental sustainability objectives of a region cannot be achieved. If we expand the meaning of environmental equity or justice beyond disproportionate impact from pollution on public health, and combine issues of populations that are disproportionately affected by environmental insults as well as adequate access to environmental benefits, then we have a paradigm under which to explore mechanisms for poor people to derive equal benefits from the advantages of environmental related business income. By exploring how poor people might benefit from nature-based business activities as an example, we can begin to demonstrate important linkages between a foundation of good environmental quality and the prosperous development of economic activity in certain societal sectors that might otherwise not make this connection. This paper addresses a Virginia Eastern Shore (USA) case history example to explore whether or not a nature-based economy and consideration of a targeted, value-added tax on this industry's income can finance the transition of a region's neediest citizens to a better quality of life and in-turn a more amenable setting to further enhance economic development in the region that is environmentally sustainable. A focus on environmental equity emerges as key in this discussion because of the historical disregard for the environmental health and rights of disenfranchised peoples, where a disproportionate and dangerous ecological price for economic growth has been paid by poor people and people of color, both in the United States and in other nations. Thus, the nexus of sustainable development and equity, where equity considerations loom large in the search for economic development that does not degrade natural resources. Introduction The increasing gap between rich and poor peoples and nations, and the growing environmental, cultural, ethnic, religious, and social crises around the world represent major challenges in moving towards global economic security. Nation-states and local communities must consider how to preserve and strengthen their economic, environmental, and social characters simultaneously if they are to sustain the extant quality of life and enhance it for the future. Positive change in any one of these three areas, however, will undoubtedly bring change in the others that may not be perceived or experienced as beneficial for all community members. In addition, the value accorded to economic or environmental enhancement may be dependent upon one's place in any community characterized by inequality. In the United States, for example, the racial stratification of Whites of European ancestry and African Americans represents one of the most tenacious forms of inequality. In locales where racial inequities persist in severe forms, ideas about balancing economic development and environmental preservation may be particularly contentious. A community's poorest and most disenfranchised members may view concern about protecting the environment over pursuing economic opportunities as an unnecessary and needlessly expensive luxury that will only cost them the ability to attain financial well-being. This disconnect is often caused by the fact that while the environmental and economic viewpoints of a community's sustainability are frequently discussed (unfortunately often separately), the equity perspective is the most poorly understood. …"

Purpose
Although Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is the most commonly diagnosed sexually transmitted infection in the USA, much controversy exists with respect to HPV vaccination, especially among parents of adolescents. Previous research has shown that exemplars in the media influence public opinion estimates about controversial social issues. However, little is known about the underlying psychological processes of how exemplars influence public opinion formation. The purpose of this paper is to systematically explore such psychological processes based on the projection theory. To this end, the important yet controversial public health issue, the mandatory HPV vaccination, was chosen.


Design/methodology/approach
A two-factor (exemplar vs proportion), between-subject experiment was conducted using online newspaper articles as main stimuli. A total of 138 participants completed the study. The analytical framework comprised the Sobel test with the Bootstrap method and a series of Ordinary Least Square hierarchical regression analyses.


Findings
The higher the proportion of exemplars against the HPV vaccination in a news article was, the greater the number of individuals who became opposed to it was. And the high personal opposition translated into negative public opinion change estimation.


Originality/value
The findings indicate that news exemplars may influence individuals’ personal opinion formation, and, in turn, contribute to their estimations of future public opinion climate, as suggested by the projection theory. Theoretical, methodological and practical implications for journalists, health educators and policy makers are discussed.

We illustrate, using data from Scotland and the USA, the issues regarding the construction of effective predictive models for disease case rates. We discuss the effects of variation in, and the problem of aligning, public health (PH) reporting and WW measurements. We investigate time-varying effects in PH-reported case rates and their relationship to WW measurements. We show the lack of proportionality of WW measurements to case rates with associated spatial heterogeneity. We illustrate how the precision of predictions is affected by the level of aggregation chosen. We determine whether PH or WW measurements are the leading indicators of disease and how they may be used in conjunction to produce predictive models. The prospects of using WW-based predictive models with or without ongoing PH data are discussed."

Using the first six waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Youth, the current study examines the relationship between early experiences of victimization and long-term physical and mental health outcomes, including general health, access to and use of health care, and health risk behaviors. Results find that individuals who are victimized before the age of 12, especially those who experienced repeated bullying, are more susceptible to a number of physical and mental health issues such as negative perceptions of physical and mental health, smoking, subsequent victimization experiences, and homelessness.

Abstract In this paper, I examine the contribution that economics can make to our understanding of key issues in health and health care. In the first part of the paper, I argue that economics can bring valuable insights into the world of over-eating and present recent economic theories that argue that the root cause of the increase in obesity lies in technological change. Technological change, in terms of the kind of work we do, the agricultural production revolution and the major cost reductions in food processing and distribution have all contributed to weight gain. This hypothesis is illustrated by data from the USA. In the second part, I argue that understanding incentives is the key to understanding the behaviour of suppliers of health care, explaining for example, why health staff 'fiddle the figures' to meet government targets and why doctors will respond to financial payments."
Overview of legislation on sewage sludge management in developed countries worldwide.,"[{'authorId': '2057905022', 'name': 'A. Christodoulou'}, {'authorId': '89200468', 'name': 'K. Stamatelatou'}]",117,2016,b337518940f7cd69e898edcbf096a07c1865ed3d,"The need to apply innovative technologies for maximizing the efficiency and minimizing the carbon footprint of sewage treatment plants has upgraded sewage sludge management to a highly sophisticated research and development sector. Sewage sludge cannot be regarded solely as 'waste'; it is a renewable resource for energy and material recovery. From this perspective, legislation on sewage sludge management tends to incorporate issues related to environmental protection, public health, climate change impacts and socio-economic benefits. This paper reviews the existing legislative frameworks and policies on sewage sludge management in various countries, highlighting the common ground as well as the different priorities in all cases studied. More specifically, the key features of legislation regarding sludge management in developed countries such as the USA, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and the European Union (EU27) are discussed."
Mapping the research addressing prescription drug monitoring programs: A scoping review.,"[{'authorId': '1753629831', 'name': 'Dimi Hoppe'}, {'authorId': '145846264', 'name': 'L. Karimi'}, {'authorId': '143657990', 'name': 'H. Khalil'}]",12,2022,303828f4e9c6c915e57ce7902c6b514b155e3e41,"ISSUES
Prescription drug monitoring programs are a harm minimisation intervention and clinical decision support tool that address the public health concern surrounding prescription drug misuse. Given the large number of studies published to date and the ongoing implementation of these programs, it is important to map the literature and identify areas for further research to improve practice.


APPROACH
A scoping review was undertaken to identify the research on prescription drug monitoring programs published between January 2015 and April 2021.


KEY FINDINGS
A total of 153 citations were included in this scoping review. The majority of the studies originated from the USA and were quantitative. Results on program effectiveness are mixed and mainly examine their association with opioid-related outcomes. Unintended consequences are revealed in the literature and this review also highlights barriers to program use.


IMPLICATIONS
Overall, findings are mixed despite the large number of studies published to date. Mapping the literature identifies priority areas for further research that can advise policymakers and clinicians on practice improvement.


CONCLUSION
Results on prescription drug monitoring program effectiveness are mixed and mainly examine their association with opioid-related outcomes. This review highlights barriers to prescription drug monitoring program effectiveness related to program use and system integration. Further research is needed in these areas to improve prescription drug monitoring program use and patient outcomes."

Public policy issues: a Canadian perspective.,"[{'authorId': '2229526762', 'name': 'The Honourable Louise Simard'}]",3,1995,503de46d63eedfbbf6ee341508ac01267a9b11af,"We live in exciting and changing times. Change cannot be avoided. Change provides the opportunity for innovation. It gives you the chance to demonstrate your creativity, according to the motivational writer, Keshavan Nair. Change presents a challenge, as well as opportunity and, like the USA and the UK, Canada is going through its own process of change in health care. The pertinent question is: how do we manage this change? Here I will discuss how the Canadian health system evolved in Saskatchewan and how it looks today and the issues and challenges that we face, our vision and our plan, and how health reform is proceeding. Saskatchewan, has always prided itself on continued innovative development, especially in the health field, and on being the birth place of medicare in North America. Saskatchewan pioneered medicare in the late 1 940s by making basic hospital services available to all provincial residents and then, in the early 1 960s, added universal health services through the establishment of a Medical Care Insurance Program. Some 30 years later Canada is going through a massive reform. In Saskatchewan, programmes provided to all residents of the province full coverage for physician services and all those provided in hospitals. The other nine provinces and two territories followed suit and, by the early 1970s, all residents of Canada were enjoying universal medical coverage funded by the federal and provincial governments through tax dollars. Over this period, Saskatchewan leaders had a vision for health care, developed a plan and put it into action, which became a model for Canada. It made it possible for all Canadians to have access to, at no direct cost to themselves, hospital and physician services, meeting a real social and economic need. Medicare in Canada is not one system. It is a network of federal/provincial systems, all guided by common goals and principles. The federal government shares the costs of the provincial medical care insurance programmes with the 10 provinces and two territories. The doctors bill the province or territory and are paid directly from the provincial or territorial medicare funds. Legal protection for physician and hospital services in all 13 systems, along with five guiding principles, are enshrined in the Canada Health Act, which is the one unifying legislative instrument in the Canadian Health System.

Role Model or Quitter? Social Media’s Response to Simone Biles at Tokyo 2020,"[{'authorId': '31905731', 'name': 'Steven Doehler'}]",4,2022,e3e0642923192aafd7d645cba2ae7560268cb6e2,"During the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, Team USA athlete Simone Biles withdrew from several gymnastics events midcompetition, citing mental health issues. Biles, one of the most recognizable stars of the Games, faced intense scrutiny from both the world’s media and the general public in the immediate aftermath. The purpose of this study was to analyze the Facebook narrative surrounding Biles’s withdrawal within the theoretical context of framing, as crafted through user comments on various public high-profile Facebook pages. A total of 87,714 user comments were collected and analyzed using the qualitative software Leximancer. The themes emerging from the data suggested a polarizing narrative, with many users supporting Biles, engaging in the wider discussion surrounding athlete mental health, while others condemned her action, suggesting she quit on the biggest sporting stage."
