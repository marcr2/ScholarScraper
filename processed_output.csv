Historically, capecitabine has been the cornerstone of adjuvant therapy for TNBC patients not achieving a pathological complete response (pCR). However, the integration of new modalities such as immunotherapy and PARP inhibitors has prompted a re-evaluation of traditional post-neoadjuvant approaches. Methods: This review synthesizes data from pivotal clinical trials and meta-analyses to evaluate the efficacy of emerging therapies in the post-neoadjuvant setting. We focus on the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), PARP inhibitors (PARPis), and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) alongside or in place of capecitabine in TNBC treatment paradigms. Results: The addition of ICIs like pembrolizumab to neoadjuvant regimens has shown increased pCR rates and improved event-free survival, posing new questions about optimal post-neoadjuvant therapies. Similarly, PARPis have demonstrated efficacy in BRCA-mutated TNBC populations, with significant improvements in disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Emerging studies on ADCs further complicate the adjuvant landscape, offering potentially efficacious alternatives to capecitabine, especially in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy. Discussion: The challenge remains to integrate these new treatments into clinical practice effectively, considering factors such as drug resistance, patient-specific characteristics, and socio-economic barriers. This review discusses the implications of these therapies and suggests a future direction focused on personalized medicine approaches in TNBC. Conclusions: As the treatment landscape for TNBC evolves, the role of capecitabine is being critically examined. While it remains a viable option for certain patient groups, the introduction of ICIs, PARPis, and ADCs offers promising alternatives that could redefine adjuvant therapy standards. Ongoing and future trials will be pivotal in determining the optimal therapeutic strategies for TNBC patients with residual disease post-neoadjuvant therapy.",capecitabine,93.55535055350553
Synergistic Enhancement of TNBC Treatment in African American Women: Integrating Resveratrol with Electrical Pulse Therapy,"[{'authorId': '2131870501', 'name': 'Pragatheiswar Giri'}, {'authorId': '6468669', 'name': 'I.

This group experiences a 40% higher mortality rate compared to women of other ethnicities, highlighting a significant disparity, and underscoring the urgent need for the development of targeted, effective treatments, specifically tailored to address these demographic women. Towards this, the efficacy of high intensity, short duration electrical pulses combined with Resveratrol (Resv), a natural polyphenol, as a novel therapeutic agent against TNBC is investigated. Electrical pulses facilitate enhanced drug transport through the opening of pores in cell membrane for those molecules that are normally non-permeable. This approach addresses the challenge of Resv's limited bioavailability and enhances its apoptotic potential. Employing MDA-MB-468 cell line, derived from an African American woman, this study investigates the effects of Resv and electrical pulses (EP) on TNBC cells. The TNBC cells were treated with Resv and subjected to eight pulses of multiple electric fields ranging from 500V/cm to 1200V/cm at 100μs, and at 1Hz, followed by assessments monitoring viability, colony formation, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The results indicate an 84% reduction in live cancer cell viability and a 4-fold increase in ROS levels with the combined treatment, suggesting a promising approach to alternative TNBC therapy. This research evaluates a natural bio compound, along with an advanced drug delivery system, targeting a reduction in mortality rates and improved quality of life for TNBC patients.",Resveratrol,93.55535055350553

Therefore, the usual adjuvant treatments for breast cancer, are not applied to TNBC. Recently, it has been found that approximately one third of TNBC tumours express androgen receptor (AR) and it is associated with better response to endocrine therapies. However, the prognostic value of AR expression in TNBC is still unclear. Therefore, in this preliminary study we evaluate the effectiveness of an anti-androgen treatment (bicalutamide) respect to conventional treatments (doxorubicin and lapatinib) in TNBC human cell lines and their corresponding xenografts. Briefly, SUM149, SUM159 and MDAMB231 TNBC cell lines were cultured in supplemented medium. Cells were plated in 96-well plates and a serial dilution of Doxorubicin, Lapatinib, Bicatulamide and respective combinations were added. In addition, 106 cells were implanted subcutaneosly into five female mice (Balb/C SCID). When tumors developed, mice were treated with doxorubicin, bicalutamide, doxorubicin + bicalutamide and doxorubicin + bicalutamide + lapatinib. Every treatment was perfomed every 3 days during 15 days and tumor reduction and appearance of metastases were evaluated. Results from cell culture showed that neoplasic cells from each cell line were high sensitive to bicalutamide treatment (SUM149 EC50: 9,860e009; MDAMB231 EC50: 9,454e009; SUM159 EC50: 2,170e009). Also, viability decreased when we added an anti-androgen (bicalutamide) to the conventional treatments (doxorubicin + lapatinib). In vivo experiments revealed a greater percentage of tumour reduction (around 70%) in mice treated with combination of treatments and a lower appearance of metastasis was observed in this group respect to control group (SUM149: 40% vs 60%; MDA-MB-231: 20% vs 75%; SUM159: 20% vs 60%). Therefore, our preliminary findings suggest that the addition of an anti-androgenic agent to treatments currently in use can reduce the tumour considerably, defining anti-androgenic treatments as a novel effective therapeutic target.

High rates of metastasis, poor prognosis, and drug resistance are the major problems associated with TNBC. The current chemotherapeutics eliminate only the bulk tumor cells (non-BCSCs) and do not affect breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). The BCSCs which are left behind after chemotherapy is reported to promote recurrence and metastasis of TNBC. Death receptor-5 (DR-5) is exclusively expressed in TNBCs and mediates the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. DR-5, therefore, can be exploited for targeted drug delivery and to induce apoptosis. Gamma-secretase mediated Notch signaling in BCSCs regulates its proliferation, differentiation, and metastasis. The endogenous ligand, Delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4), is reported to activate this Notch signaling in TNBC. Blocking this signaling pathway using both gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) and DLL4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) may produce synergistic benefits. Further, the GSIs (DAPT, LY-411575, RO4929097, MK0752, etc.) suffer from poor bioavailability and off-target side effects such as diarrhea, suppression of lymphopoiesis, headache, hypertension, fatigue, and ventricular dysfunctions. In this hypothesis, we discuss Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) based drug delivery systems containing GSIs and surface modified with DR-5 and DLL4 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to effectivity target and treat TNBC. The delivery system is designed to deliver the drug cargo precisely to TNBCs through its DR-5 receptors and hence expected to reduce the off-target side effects of GSIs. Further, DLL4 mAb and GSIs are expected to act synergistically to block the Notch signal mediated BCSCs proliferation, differentiation, and metastasis.",gamma-secretase,78.55535055350553

Here, we found that PRL treatment of TNBC cells to significantly depletes the highly tumorigenic BCSC subpopulations CD44+/CD24- and ALDH+ and differentiate them to the least tumorigenic CD44-/CD24- and ALDH- phenotype with limited tumorsphere formation and self-renewal capacities. Importantly, we found PRL to induce a heterochromatin phenotype marked by histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and accompanied by ultrastructural cellular architecture associated with differentiation and senescence rendering the cells refractory to growth signals. Crucially, we found PRL to mediate these effects in vivo in a preclinical animal xenograft of TNBC controlling tumor growth. These results reveal that the lactogenic hormone PRL may exert its anti-tumorigenic effects in TNBC through cellular reprogramming indicative of differentiation resulting in depletion of BCSCs and restricting tumorigenesis.",Prolactin,76.05535055350553

However, we are now witnessing the dawn of targeted therapies for TNBC in which progress has stemmed from an improved understanding of the components that make TNBC unique. The identification of biomarkers, such as BRCA1/2, PIK3CA and RSK2, have advanced the field remarkably and there is considerable interest in finding novel therapeutics for TNBC that offer durable clinical benefit with fewer adverse events. Areas covered We discuss phase I/II trials of new and emerging targeted therapies for TNBC, according to ClinicalTrials.gov up to June 2020. Although the emphasis is on ongoing and completed early phase trials, we also highlight pivotal studies that have led to the approval of new targeted classes of drugs for TNBC, with a focus on outcomes and common adverse events of each class of therapy. Expert opinion The way forward for TNBC treatment is through precision medicine. The use of novel agents matched with biomarkers to identify patients with the best chance of sustainable response offers new hope. We now have great potential for improving the outcomes for patients with TNBC.",BRCA1/2,74.55535055350553

Chemotherapy, particularly with anthracycline and taxanes, remains the backbone for medical management for both early and metastatic TNBC. More recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapy have revolutionized cancer treatment. Included in the different strategies studied for TNBC treatment is drug repurposing. Despite the numerous medications available, numerous studies in medicinal chemistry are still aimed at the synthesis of new compounds in order to find new antiproliferative agents capable of treating TNBC. Additionally, some supplemental micronutrients, nutraceuticals and functional foods can potentially reduce the risk of developing cancer or can retard the rate of growth and metastases of established malignant diseases.

It has a limited therapeutic index owing to its extreme toxicity and the emergence of drug resistance. As a result, there is a pressing need to find innovative drugs that enhance the effectiveness of doxorubicin while minimizing its toxicity. The rationale of the present study is that combining emerging treatment agents or repurposed pharmaceuticals with doxorubicin might increase susceptibility to therapeutics and the subsequent establishment of improved pharmacological combinations for treating triple-negative breast cancer. Additionally, combined treatment will facilitate dosage reduction, reducing the toxicity associated with doxorubicin. Recently, the third-generation retinoid adapalene was reported as an effective anticancer agent in several malignancies. This study aimed to determine the anticancer activity of adapalene in TNBC cells and its effectiveness in combination with doxorubicin, and the mechanistic pathways in inhibiting tumorigenicity. Adapalene inhibits tumor cell growth and proliferation and acts synergistically with doxorubicin in inhibiting growth, colony formation, and migration of TNBC cells. Also, the combination of adapalene and doxorubicin enhanced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species triggering hyperphosphorylation of Erk1/2 and caspase-dependent apoptosis.

Chemotherapy remains the main adjuvant treatment for patients with TNBC. Anthracycline/taxane-based regimens are the standard of care in adjuvant settings. The addition of capecitabine or platinum may offer extra benefits to patients with TNBC, but at the cost of increased toxicity or adverse events. Dose-dense chemotherapy may enhance treatment efficacy in patients who are able to tolerate the treatment regimen, especially in high-risk patients. As a heterogenous disease, TNBC can be classified into several molecular subtypes according to genomic or transcriptional features, which may indicate potential targets for more precise and individualized treatment strategies. With our increased understanding of signal pathways associated with TNBC, as well as the discovery of novel biomarkers indicative of TNBC prognosis, several new therapeutic options are under investigation, and some have already reported good results.

Due to the loss of expression of receptors, treatment options for TNBC are limited. Therefore, finding safe and effective treatments for patients with TNBC is a major objective for clinicians. Previous studies suggested that cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells may be beneficial for patients with a variety of tumor types. However, CIK therapy is not effective for all patients. In this study, we found that focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that regulates several cellular functions in different cells, has the potential to regulate tumor cells sensitized to CIK cells. Knockdown of FAK expression in TNBC cells or the treatment of TNBC cells with a FAK inhibitor followed by coculture with CIK cells increases death of TNBC cells, suggesting that FAK plays important roles in sensitizing tumor cells to CIK cells. This phenomenon could be regulated by a FAK-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-related mechanism. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the cytotoxic effect of CIK cell therapy in TNBC treatment, and show that CIK cell therapy combined with FAK inhibitors may be a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with TNBC.",FAK,71.05535055350553

Phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr705) as a biomarker of response to pimozide treatment in triple-negative breast cancer,"[{'authorId': '1994625820', 'name': 'Sundee Dees'}, {'authorId': '39748972', 'name': 'L.

Through its lack of expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), this subtype remains unresponsive to traditional targeted therapies. Undesirable and sometimes life-threatening side effects associated with current chemotherapeutic agents warrant the development of more targeted treatment options. Targeting signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a transcription factor implicated in breast cancer (BCa) progression, has proven to be an efficient approach to halt cancer growth in vitro and in vivo. Currently, there are no FDA-approved STAT3 inhibitors for TNBC. Although pimozide, a FDA-approved antipsychotic drug, has been attributed a role as a STAT3 inhibitor in several cancers, its role on this pathway remains unexplored in TNBC. As a “one size fits all” approach cannot be applied to TNBC therapies due to the heterogeneous nature of this aggressive cancer, we hypothesized that STAT3 could be a novel biomarker of response to guide pimozide therapy. Using human cell lines representative of four TNBC subtypes (basal-like 1, basal-like 2, mesenchymal-like, mesenchymal stem-like), our current report demonstrates that pimozide significantly reduced their invasion and migration, an effect that was predicted by STAT3 phosphorylation on tyrosine residue 705 (Tyr705). Mechanistically, phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr705) inhibition resulting from pimozide treatment caused a downregulation of downstream transcriptional targets such as matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and vimentin, both implicated in invasion and migration. The identification of biomarkers of response to TNBC treatments is an active area of research in the field of precision medicine and our results propose phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr705) as a novel biomarker to guide pimozide treatment as an inhibitor of invasion and migration.",pimozide,70.55535055350553

Ferroptosis is a unique mode of programmed cell death (PCD) at the morphological, physiological, and molecular levels, mainly characterized by cell death induced by iron-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxides, which plays a substantial role in a variety of diseases, including tumors and inflammatory diseases. TNBC cells have been reported to display a peculiar equilibrium metabolic profile of iron and glutathione, which may increase the sensitivity of TNBC to ferroptosis. TNBC possesses a higher sensitivity to ferroptosis than other breast cancer types. Ferroptosis also occurred between immune cells and tumor cells, suggesting that regulating ferroptosis may remodel TNBC by modulating the immune response. Many ferroptosis-related genes or molecules have characteristic expression patterns and are expected to be diagnostic targets for TNBC. Besides, therapeutic strategies based on ferroptosis, including the isolation and extraction of natural drugs and the use of ferroptosis inducers, are urgent for TNBC personalized treatment. Thus, this review will explore the contribution of ferroptosis in TNBC progression, diagnosis, and treatment, to provide novel perspectives and therapeutic strategies for TNBC management.",ferroptosis,70.05535055350553

Dual-target murine double minute 2 (MDM2) and murine double minute X (MDMX) inhibitor has been proved to play a critical part against cancer, particularly focusing on the tremendous potential to enhance the efficacy of doxorubicin (DOX), however little was reported in TNBC. In the present study, we investigated the synergistic antitumor effect of the MDM2/MDMX inhibitor with DOX using three TNBC cell lines, two in situ transplantation tumor models and 214 clinical samples. We observed that the MDM2/MDMX inhibitor combined with DOX could not only inhibit cell vitality and migration and invasion abilities, but also highly inhibit tumor growth in TNBC nude mice. Besides, co-treatment of MDM2/MDMX inhibitor and DOX suppressed epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) through increasing the TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1), transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) expression. Small interfering RNA-mediated TAB1 knockdown induced the EMT, desensitized cells to DOX and enhanced the migration and invasion abilities. High MDM2/MDMX expression was positively associated with weak TAB1 expression in 214 TNBC tumor tissues confirmed by immumohistochemical staining and MDM2/MDMX/TAB1 expression was significantly related to TNBC patient survival. These findings indicate that dual-target MDM2/MDMX inhibitor could increase the sensitization of doxorubicin and inhibit migration and invasion abilities in TNBC cells through p38 MAPK pathway activation caused EMT suppression and hence could be useful in TNBC treatments in future.",MDM2/MDMX,69.55535055350553

The generated nanovectors consist of PLGA-based polymeric nanoparticles, which were loaded with PD-L1 siRNA and conjugated on their surface with a new RNA aptamer, specific for TNBC and resistant to nucleases. In vitro results demonstrated that these aptamer-conjugated nanoparticles promote siRNA uptake specifically into TNBC MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 target cells, along with its endosomal release, without recognizing non-TNBC BT-474 breast cancer cells.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer and lack of target. Therefore, chemotherapy is the only approved systemic treatment in TNBC. Here, we synthesized the calcium peroxide-modified magnetic nanoparticles (CaO2-MNPs) with the function of oxygen generation to improve and enhance the therapeutic efficiency of doxorubicin treatment in the hypoxia microenvironment of TNBC. CaO2-MNPs promoted ubiquitination and protein degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). Furthermore, CaO2-MNPs inhibited autophagy and induced apoptosis in TNBC cells. CaO2-MNPs in combination with doxorubicin showed a stronger tumor-suppressive effect on TNBC compared to the doxorubicin treatment alone in an orthotopic mouse model. Our findings suggest that combined with CaO2-MNPs and doxorubicin attenuates HIF-1α expression to improve the efficiency of chemotherapy in TNBC. Abstract Cancer response to chemotherapy is regulated not only by intrinsic sensitivity of cancer cells but also by tumor microenvironment. Tumor hypoxia, a condition of low oxygen level in solid tumors, is known to increase the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. Due to lack of target in TNBC, chemotherapy is the only approved systemic treatment. We evaluated the effect of hypoxia on chemotherapy resistance in TNBC in a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Furthermore, we synthesized the calcium peroxide-modified magnetic nanoparticles (CaO2-MNPs) with the function of oxygen generation to improve and enhance the therapeutic efficiency of doxorubicin treatment in the hypoxia microenvironment of TNBC. The results of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) software showed that the hypoxia and autophagy gene sets are significantly enriched in TNBC patients. We found that the chemical hypoxia stabilized the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) protein and increased doxorubicin resistance in TNBC cells. Moreover, hypoxia inhibited the induction of apoptosis and autophagy by doxorubicin. In addition, CaO2-MNPs promoted ubiquitination and protein degradation of HIF-1α. Furthermore, CaO2-MNPs inhibited autophagy and induced apoptosis in TNBC cells. Our animal studies with an orthotopic mouse model showed that CaO2-MNPs in combination with doxorubicin exhibited a stronger tumor-suppressive effect on TNBC, compared to the doxorubicin treatment alone. Our findings suggest that combined with CaO2-MNPs and doxorubicin attenuates HIF-1α expression to improve the efficiency of chemotherapy in TNBC.",doxorubicin,69.05535055350553

Areas covered This article summarizes the clinical development and ongoing research on atezolizumab in the treatment of metastatic TNBC. Results of atezolizumab monotherapy trials and data from combination studies with chemotherapy in the advanced setting are reviewed, with special focus on the design, methods, and key findings of the IMpassion130 trial. Expert opinion The approval of atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel represents an important advance in the treatment of metastatic TNBC. This combination has a favorable risk-benefit profile and is associated with clinically meaningful outcomes. However, further research is needed to identify better predictive biomarkers of response as well as novel immunotherapeutic strategies with atezolizumab and other anticancer drugs.",atezolizumab,67.55535055350553

TNBC progression is associated with expansion of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Few insights are available regarding druggable targets that drive the TNBC CSC state. This review summarizes the literature on TNBC CSCs and the compelling evidence that they are addicted to the MUC1-C transmembrane protein. In normal epithelia, MUC1-C is activated by loss of homeostasis and induces reversible wound-healing responses of inflammation and repair. However, in settings of chronic inflammation, MUC1-C promotes carcinogenesis. MUC1-C induces EMT, epigenetic reprogramming and chromatin remodeling in TNBC CSCs, which are dependent on MUC1-C for self-renewal and tumorigenicity. MUC1-C-induced lineage plasticity in TNBC CSCs confers DNA damage resistance and immune evasion by chronic activation of inflammatory pathways and global changes in chromatin architecture. Of therapeutic significance, an antibody generated against the MUC1-C extracellular domain has been advanced in a clinical trial of anti-MUC1-C CAR T cells and in IND-enabling studies for development as an antibody–drug conjugate (ADC). Agents targeting the MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain have also entered the clinic and are undergoing further development as candidates for advancing TNBC treatment.

However, thermoresistance caused by PTT, as well as uncertainty in the physiological metabolism of existing phototherapeutic nanoformulations, severely limit their clinical applications. Herein, based on the clinically chemotherapeutic drug mitoxantrone (MTO), a multifunctional nanoplatform (MTO‐micelles) is developed to realize mutually synergistic mild‐photothermal chemotherapy. MTO with excellent near‐infrared absorption (≈669 nm) can function not only as a chemotherapeutic agent but also as a photothermal transduction agent with elevated photothermal conversion efficacy (ƞ = 54.62%). MTO‐micelles can accumulate at the tumor site through the enhanced permeability and retention effect. Following local near‐infrared irradiation, mild hyperthermia (<50 °C) assists MTO in binding tumor cell DNA, resulting in chemotherapeutic sensitization. In addition, downregulation of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) expression due to enhanced DNA damage can in turn weaken tumor thermoresistance, boosting the efficacy of mild PTT. Both in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that MTO‐micelles possess excellent synergetic tumor inhibition effects.

The protease cathepsin D (cath-D) is a marker of poor prognosis in TNBC and a tumor-specific extracellular target for antibody-based therapy. The identification of cath-D substrates is crucial for the mechanistic understanding of its role in the TNBC microenvironment and future therapeutic developments. Methods: The cath-D substrate repertoire was investigated by N-Terminal Amine Isotopic Labeling of Substrates (TAILS)-based degradome analysis in a co-culture assay of TNBC cells and breast fibroblasts. Substrates were validated by amino-terminal oriented mass spectrometry of substrates (ATOMS). Cath-D and SPARC expression in TNBC was examined using an online transcriptomic survival analysis, tissue micro-arrays, TNBC cell lines, patient-derived xenografts (PDX), human TNBC samples, and mammary tumors from MMTV-PyMT Ctsd-/-knock-out mice. The biological role of SPARC and its fragments in TNBC were studied using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analysis, gene expression knockdown, co-culture assays, western blot analysis, RT-quantitative PCR, adhesion assays, Transwell motility, trans-endothelial migration and invasion assays. Results: TAILS analysis showed that the matricellular protein SPARC is a substrate of extracellular cath-D. In vitro, cath-D induced limited proteolysis of SPARC C-terminal extracellular Ca2+ binding domain at acidic pH, leading to the production of SPARC fragments (34-, 27-, 16-, 9-, and 6-kDa). Similarly, cath-D secreted by TNBC cells cleaved fibroblast- and cancer cell-derived SPARC at the tumor pericellular acidic pH. SPARC cleavage also occurred in TNBC tumors. Among these fragments, only the 9-kDa SPARC fragment inhibited TNBC cell adhesion and spreading on fibronectin, and stimulated their migration, endothelial transmigration, and invasion. Conclusions: Our study establishes a novel crosstalk between proteases and matricellular proteins in the tumor microenvironment through limited SPARC proteolysis, revealing a novel targetable 9-kDa bioactive SPARC fragment for new TNBC treatments. Our study will pave the way for the development of strategies for targeting bioactive fragments from matricellular proteins in TNBC.",SPARC,65.55535055350553

Furthermore, we have also investigated the HuR therapeutic relevance in TNBCs, which is an aggressive breast cancer subtype. Using an online meta-analysis tool, we found that HuR protein overexpression positively correlates with reduced overall survival of TNBC patients (p = 0.028). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the TNBC breast cancer cell lines i.e., MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 are good model systems to study HuR protein, as they both exhibit a significant amount of cytoplasmic HuR (active form). Quercetin treatment significantly inhibited the cytoplasmic HuR in both TNBC cell lines. By using specific HuR siRNA, we established that quercetin-mediated inhibition of adhesion and migration of TNBC cells is dependent on HuR. Upon analyzing adhesion proteins i.e., β-catenin and CD44, we found that quercetin mediated effect on TNBC adhesion and migration was through the HuR-β-catenin axis and CD44, independently. Overall, the present results demonstrate that elevated HuR levels are associated with TNBC progression and relapse, and the ability of quercetin to inhibit cytoplasmic HuR protein provides a rationale for using it as an anticancer agent for the treatment of aggressive TNBCs.

This study is the first to identify a novel circular RNA (circRNA), circTBC1D14, whose expression is significantly upregulated in TNBC. The authors confirm that high circTBC1D14 expression is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. circTBC1D14‐associated mass spectrometry and RNA‐binding protein‐related bioinformatics strategies indicate that FUS can interact with circTBC1D14, which can bind to the downstream flanking sequence of circTBC1D14 to induce cyclization. FUS is an essential biomarker associated with stress granules (SGs), and the authors find that hypoxic conditions can induce FUS–circTBC1D14‐associated SG formation in the cytoplasm after modification by protein PRMT1. Subsequently, circTBC1D14 increases the stability of PRMT1 by inhibiting its K48‐regulated polyubiquitination, leading to the upregulation of PRMT1 expression. In addition, FUS–circTBC1D14 SGs can initiate a cascade of SG‐linked proteins to recognize and control the elimination of SGs by recruiting LAMP1 and enhancing lysosome‐associated autophagy flux, thus contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and promoting tumor progression in TNBC. Overall, these findings reveal that circTBC1D14 is a potential prognostic indicator that can serve as a therapeutic target for TNBC treatment.",circTBC1D14,65.05535055350553

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and highly heterogeneous subtype of breast cancer and associated with poor prognosis. A better understanding of the biology of this complex cancer is needed to develop novel therapeutic strategies for improvement of patient survival. We have previously demonstrated that Thymoquinone (TQ), the major phenolic compound found in Nigella sativa, induces anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects and inhibits in vivo tumor growth in orthotopic TNBC models in mice. Also, we have previously shown that Beclin-1 and LC3 autophagy genes contributes to TNBC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, suggesting that Beclin-1 and LC3 genes provide proto-oncogenic effects in TNBC. However, the role of Beclin1 and LC3 in mediating TQ-induced anti-tumor effects in TNBC is not known.


OBJECTIVE
To investigate the effects of TQ on the major autophagy mediators, Beclin-1 and LC3 expression, as wells autophagic activity in TNBC cells.


METHODS
Cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and autophagy activity were evaluated using MTS cell viability, colony formation assay, wound healing and acridine orange staining assays, respectively. Western blotting and RT-PCR assays were used to investigate LC3 and Beclin-1 protein and gene expressions, respectively, in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells in response to TQ treatments.


RESULTS
TQ treatment significantly inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and autophagic activity of MDA-MB-231 cells and suppressed LC3 and Beclin-1 expressions. Furthermore, TQ treatment led to the inhibition of Integrin-β1, VEGF, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in TNBC cells.


CONCLUSION
TQ inhibits autophagic activity and expression of Beclin-1 and LC3 in TNBC cells and suppresses pathways related to cell migration/invasion and angiogenesis, including Integrin-β1, VEGF, MMP-2 and MMP-9, suggesting that TQ may be used to control autophagic activity and oncogenic signaling in TNBC.",Thymoquinone,64.55535055350553

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) exhibits a high mortality rate and is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. As previous studies have shown that histone deacetylases (HDAC) may represent molecular targets for TNBC treatment, we screened a small library of synthetic molecules and identified a potent HDAC inhibitor (HDACi), YF438, which exerts effective anti-TNBC activity both in vitro and in vivo. Proteomic and biochemical studies revealed that YF438 significantly downregulated mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) expression. In parallel, loss of MDM2 expression or blocking MDM2 E3 ligase activity rendered TNBC cells less sensitive to YF438 treatment, revealing an essential role of MDM2 E3 ligase activity in YF438-induced inhibition of TNBC. Mechanistically, YF438 disturbed the interaction between HDAC1 and MDM2, induced the dissociation of MDM2-MDMX, and subsequently increased MDM2 self-ubiquitination to accelerate its degradation, which ultimately inhibited growth and metastasis of TNBC cells. In addition, analysis of clinical tissue samples demonstrated high expression levels of MDM2 in TNBC, and MDM2 protein levels closely correlated with TNBC progression and metastasis. Collectively, these findings show that MDM2 plays an essential role in TNBC progression and targeting the HDAC1–MDM2–MDMX signaling axis with YF438 may provide a promising therapeutic option for TNBC. Furthermore, this novel underlying mechanism of a hydroxamate-based HDACi in altering MDM2 highlights the need for further development of HDACi for TNBC treatment. Significance: This study uncovers the essential role of MDM2 in TNBC progression and suggests that targeting the HDAC1–MDM2–MDMX axis with a hydroxamate-based HDACi could be a promising therapeutic strategy for TNBC.",YF438,64.05535055350553

These biomarkers will not only facilitate a better optimization of treatment strategies, but they will also avoid unnecessary side effects in non-responders, and limit the increasing financial toxicity linked to the use of these agents. Huge efforts have been deployed to identify predictive biomarkers for the ICI, but until now, the fruits of this labor remained largely unsatisfactory. Among clinically validated biomarkers, only programmed death-ligand 1 protein (PD-L1) expression has been prospectively assessed in TNBC trials. In addition to this, microsatellite instability and a high tumor mutational burden are approved as tumor agnostic biomarkers, but only a small percentage of TNBC fits this category. Furthermore, TNBC should no longer be approached as a single biological entity, but rather as a complex disease with different molecular, clinicopathological, and tumor microenvironment subgroups.

In this study, it was found that luminal and triple‐negative breast cancers require distinct therapeutic approaches because of their different amounts of autophagy flux. We identified that autophagy flux was inhibited in triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) CSCs. Moreover, miRNA‐181a (miR‐181a) expression is upregulated in both TNBC CSCs and patient tissues. Autophagy‐related 5 (ATG5) and autophagy‐related 2B (ATG2B) participate in the early formation of autophagosomes and were revealed as targets of miR‐181a. Inhibition of miR‐181a expression led to attenuation of TNBC stemness and an increase in autophagy flux. Furthermore, treatment with curcumin led to attenuation of cancer stemness in TNBC CSCs; the expression of ATG5 and ATG2B was enhanced and there was an increase of autophagy flux. These results indicated that ATG5 and ATG2B are involved in the suppression of cancer stemness in TNBC.

Due to absence of targetable hormone receptor expression, chemotherapy is the current standard of care for TNBC. However, recurrence and metastasis following treatment with chemotherapy and radiation remain major contributors to mortality. To develop more effective treatments of TNBC, molecular pathways involved in tumor growth, vascularization, and apoptosis have been investigated as potential targets. In this review, we outline promising biological targets that may be implicated in future TNBC treatments. Abstract Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive form of breast cancer. Due to its heterogeneity and lack of hormone receptor expression, this subtype is more likely to metastasize and resist treatment attempts than are other forms of breast cancer. Due to the absence of targetable receptors, chemotherapy and breast conserving surgery have been the predominant treatment options for patients. However, resistance to chemotherapy and local recurrence of the tumors is frequent. Emerging immunotherapies have begun to change treatment plans for patients diagnosed with TNBC. In this review, we discuss the various immune pathways identified in TNBC and the role they play as targets for new potential treatment choices. Various therapeutic options that inhibit key pathways in cellular growth cycles, DNA repair mechanisms, epithelial mesenchymal transition, and immunosuppression have been shown to improve survival in patients with this disease. With promising results thus far, continued studies of immunotherapy and neoadjuvant therapy options for TNBC are likely to alter the treatment course for these diagnoses in the future.",chemotherapy,63.555350553505534

Combination of anti-angiogenesis and immunotherapy holds promise for effective inhibition of tumor proliferation and invasion, while it remains challenging for specific targeting drug delivery to tumors and metastatic lesions. Here, a multifunctional biomimetic liposome loading Gambogic acid (G/R-MLP) was developed using Ginsenoside Rg3 (Rg3) to substitute cholesterol and cancer cell membrane coating, which was designed to increase long-circulating action by a low immunogenicity and specifically deliver Gambogic acid (GA) to tumor site and metastatic lesions by homologous targeting and glucose transporter (GLUT) targeting. After G/R-MLP accumulated in the primary tumors and metastatic nodules, it synergistically enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of GA, effectively suppressing the tumor growth and lung metastasis by killing tumor cells, inhibiting tumor cell migration and invasion, achieving anti-angiogenesis and improving the anti-tumor immunity. All in all, the strategy combining chemotherapy, anti-angiogenesis and immunotherapy improved therapeutic efficiency and prolonged survival, providing a new perspective for the clinical treatment of TNBC.

However, the relationship between tumor mutation burden (TMB) and immune infiltration and the prognosis of TNBC remains unclear. In this study, to explore the immunogenicity of TNBC, we divided patients with TNBC into high and low TMB groups based on the somatic mutation data of TNBC in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and screened out genes with mutation rate ≥10. Then, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that the 5-year survival rate of the high TMB group was much higher than that of the low TMB group and the two groups also showed differences in immune cell infiltration. Further exploration found that the FAT3 gene, which displays significant difference and a higher mutation rate between the two groups, is not only significantly related to the prognosis of TNBC patients but also exhibits difference in immune cell infiltration between the wild group and the mutant group of the FAT3 gene. The results of gene set enrichment analysis and drug sensitivity analysis further support the importance of the FAT3 gene in TNBC. This study reveals the characteristics of TMB and immune cell infiltration in triple-negative breast cancer and their relationship with prognosis, to provide new biomarkers and potential treatment options for the future treatment of TNBC.

Although the molecular‐biological mechanisms of the initiation and development of TNBC have been explored a lot, the exact details underlying its progressions are still not clear. Long non‐coding RNAs (lncRNAs), with the length greater than 200 nucleotides, are non‐protein coding transcripts. Previous researches have shown that lncRNAs are significantly involved in a variety of pathophysiological processes such as cell migration, invasion, proliferation, differentiation and development. lncRNAs’ dysregulated expressions have been observed in many types of tumours including TNBCs.

This study aims to uncover the essential role and the underlying molecular mechanism(s) of the m6A reader YTHDC1 in promoting triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) metastasis. Methods: In vitro and in vivo models were employed to determine the pathological function of YTHDC1 in TNBC metastasis. To identify bona fide YTHDC1 target RNAs, we conducted RNA-seq, m6A-seq, and RIP-seq, followed by integrative data analysis and validation assays. Results: By analyzing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, we found that elevated expression of YTHDC1 is positively correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Using a mammary fat pad mouse model of TNBC, YTHDC1 significantly promoted lung metastasis of TNBC cells. Through multiple transcriptome-wide sequencing and integrative data analysis, we revealed dysregulation of metastasis-related pathways following YTHDC1 depletion and identified SMAD3 as a bona fide YTHDC1 target RNA. Depletion of YTHDC1 caused nuclear retention of SMAD3 mRNA, leading to lower SMAD3 protein levels. Loss of YTHDC1 led to impaired TGF-β-induced gene expression, leading to inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and suppressed TNBC cell migration and invasion. SMAD3 overexpression was able to restore the response to TGF-β in YTHDC1 depleted TNBC cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the oncogenic role of YTHDC1 is mediated through its recognition of m6A as m6A-binding defective mutants of YTHDC1 were unable to rescue the impaired cell migration and invasion of YTHDC1 knockout TNBC cells. Conclusions: We show that YTHDC1 plays a critical oncogenic role in TNBC metastasis through promoting the nuclear export and expression of SMAD3 to augment the TGF-β signaling cascade. Overall, our study demonstrates that YTHDC1 is vital for TNBC progression by enhancing TNBC cell survival and TGF-β-mediated EMT via SMAD3 to enable the formation of distant metastasis and highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting the YTHDC1/m6A/SMAD3 axis for TNBC treatment.",YTHDC1,62.555350553505534

Tuft1 plays an important regulatory role in the survival of breast cancer cells; however, its role in regulating TNBC metastatic potential has not been well-characterized. Our aim was therefore to systematically study the mechanism of TUFT1 in the metastasis, stemness, and chemoresistance of TNBC and provide new predictors and targets for BC treatment. Methods: We used western blotting and IHC to measure TUFT1and Rac1-GTP expression levels in both human BC samples and cell lines. A combination of shRNA, migration/invasion assays, sphere formation assay, apoptosis assays, nude mouse xenograft tumor model, and GTP activity assays was used for further mechanistic studies. Results: We demonstrated that silencing TUFT1 in TNBC cells significantly inhibited cell metastasis and stemness in vitro. A nude mouse xenograft tumor model revealed that TUFT1 knockdown greatly decreased spontaneous lung metastasis of TNBC tumors. Mechanism studies showed that TUFT1 promoted tumor cell metastasis and stemness by up-regulating the Rac1/β-catenin pathway. Moreover, mechanistic studies indicated that the lack of TUFT1 expression in TNBC cells conferred more sensitive to chemotherapy and increased cell apoptosis via down-regulating the Rac1/β-catenin signaling pathway. Further, TUFT1 expression positively correlated with Rac1-GTP in TNBC samples, and co-expression of TUFT1 and Rac1-GTP predicted poor prognosis in TNBC patients who treated with chemotherapy. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that TUFT1/Rac1/β-catenin pathway may provide a potential target for more effective treatment of TNBC.",TUFT1,62.055350553505534

Here we report that WWOX inactivation correlates with advanced stages of TNBC and that its levels are frequently altered in TNBC cells. Ectopic restoration of WWOX in WWOX-negative TNBC cells inhibited metastasis while its depletion in WWOX-positive TNBC cells promoted metastasis. WWOX was a negative regulator of c-MYC, which regulated miR-146a expression and consequently fibronectin levels, contributing to an epithelial status of the cell. Treatment of TNBC cells with anti-miR-146a rescued the WWOX antimetastatic phenotype. Moreover, overexpression of MYC in WWOX-expressing TNBC cells overrode WWOX effects on miR-146a and fibronectin levels. Altogether, our data uncover an essential role for WWOX in antagonizing TNBC progression and highlight its potential use as a biomarker for metastasis.

However, the insensitivity of TNBC cells to Taxol greatly limits the anticancer effect of the drug and leads to patient mortality. The present study first evaluated the expression levels of microRNA (miR)-1207-5p in human normal breast epithelial MCF-10A cells and TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436 and MDA-MB-453). The results revealed that the highest miR-1207-5p level was in MDA-MB-231, which suggested an oncogenic role of miR-1207-5p in TNBC. Therefore, MDA-MB-231 served as the present study's research model in subsequent experiments. The mRNAs that functioned as tumor suppressor factors for miR-1207-5p were then determined. Leucine zipper tumor suppressor gene 1 (LZTS1), which was predicted by TargetScan 6.2 and was supported by the results of a dual luciferase assay, was identified as a target of miR-1207-5p. AntagomiR-1207-5p increased LZTS1 mRNA and protein expressions, enhanced cell growth arrest and cell apoptosis induced by Taxol in MDA-MB-231 cells. Additionally, it was observed that, when compared with Taxol treatment, the combination of Taxol and antagomiR-1207-5p induced a sharp decrease in B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and phosphorylated-protein kinase B expression accompanied by an increase in the Bcl-2-associated X protein expression. Finally, miR-1207-5p expression was significantly increased, while LZTS1 expression was significantly decreased, in TNBC tissues when compared with normal adjacent tissues, and there was a negative correlation between miR-1207-5p and LZTS1 expression. In addition, there was a notable elevation in the expression of miR-1207-5p and a reduction in the expression of LZTS1 in the Taxol non-responsive TNBC tissues when compared with the Taxol-responsive TNBC tissues. The results of the present study suggested that miR-1207-5p may be a promising predictor of sensitivity towards Taxol in TNBC.",Taxol,61.555350553505534

While combinational approaches of chemotherapeutics have been highlighted as a new treatment strategy for TNBC to reduce side effects, combinations of anti‐cancer agents with herbal medicines have not been reported. We recently reported that newly modified traditional Chinese medicine named SH003 inhibited TNBC growth. Considering a combinational strategy for TNBC treatment, we further studied synergistic effects of SH003 with various anti‐cancer drugs in TNBC treatment. Here, we demonstrate that SH003 shows a synergistic effect with doxorubicin on TNBC treatment. Our in vitro cell viability assays revealed that SH003 and doxorubicin showed a synergistic effect in the well‐defined TNBC cell line, MDA‐MB‐231. Moreover, we found that the combinational treatment caused Caspase‐dependent apoptotic cell death. Our in vivo mouse xenograft tumor growth assays confirmed that combinational treatment of SH003 with doxorubicin repressed MDA‐MB‐231 tumor growth with no weight loss. Therefore, we conclude that the combinational treatment of SH003 with doxorubicin shows the synergism in TNBC treatment, and suggest that SH003 can be used together with conventional anti‐cancer drugs in chemotherapeutic approaches.

It is the subtype of breast cancers with the highest metastatic potential and recurrence at the first 5 years after diagnosis. In addition, mortality increases when a complete pathological response is not achieved. As TNBC cells lack estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors, patients do not respond well to hormone and anti-HER2 therapies, and conventional chemotherapy remains the standard treatment. Despite efforts to develop targeted therapies, this disease continues to have a high unmet medical need, and there is an urgent demand for customized diagnosis and therapeutics. As immunotherapy is changing the paradigm of anticancer treatment, it arises as an alternative treatment for TNBC patients. TNBC is classified as an immunogenic subtype of breast cancer due to its high levels of tumor mutational burden and presence of immune cell infiltrates. This review addresses the implications of these characteristics for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of the disease. Herein, the role of immune gene signatures and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes as biomarkers in TNBC is reviewed, identifying their application in patient diagnosis and stratification, as well as predictors of efficacy. The expression of PD-L1 expression is already considered to be predictive of response to checkpoint inhibitor therapy, but the challenges regarding its value as biomarker are described. Moreover, the rationales for different formats of immunotherapy against TNBC currently under clinical research are discussed, and major clinical trials are highlighted. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated clinical benefit, particularly in early-stage tumors and when administered in combination with chemotherapy, with several regimens approved by the regulatory authorities. The success of antibody–drug conjugates and research on other emerging approaches, such as vaccines and cell therapies, will also be addressed. These advances give hope on the development of personalized, more effective, and safe treatments, which will improve the survival and quality of life of patients with TNBC.",immunotherapy,61.555350553505534

In the current study, we examine the effect of ONC201 on triple-negative breast cancer cells (TNBC), a subtype of breast cancer that is sensitive to TRAIL. We find that ONC201 inhibits the growth of TNBC cells including TNBC cells that have developed acquired TRAIL resistance. However, TNBC cells that have developed acquired ONC201 resistance are cross-resistant to TRAIL. Mechanistically, ONC201 triggers an integrated stress response (ISR) involving the activation of the transcription factor ATF4. Knockdown of ATF4 impairs ONC201-induced apoptosis of TNBC cells. Importantly, the activation of ATF4 is compromised in ONC201-resistant TNBC cells.

The increased research interests in TNBC nowadays are due to the lack of clinically validated and molecular-targeted therapy. Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN) is the major biosynthetic enzyme for the synthesis of fatty acids from small carbon substrates. Elevated expression of FASN is frequent phenotypic alterations in many human cancers. The flavonoid Quercetin is one of the most abundant bioflavonoids in the human diet and a known inducer of apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. We aimed to evaluate the effects of Quercetin on TNBC in vitro and in vivo. Quercetin induced a significant growth-inhibitory effect against TNBC cells and the IC50 were 230 ± 3 and 415 ± 4 μM for the TNBC cells, MDAMB-231 and MDA-MB-157 respectively. Quercetin treatment induced anticancer/apoptotic effects against TNBC cells as shown by morphological alterations, DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3 activation. When compared to controls, decreased protein expression of FASN, β-catenin, Bcl-2, and reduced-nuclear accumulation of β-catenin were detected after Quercetin treatment. Quercetin in vivo-treatment induced significant tumor growth inhibition by 41.7% after 25 days of treatment. Immunohistochemical data showed a clear inhibition of FASN expression in tumor xenografts after Quercetin treatment. Quercetin possibly targets the lipogenic enzyme FASN and β-catenin in TNBCs. Quercetin-induced apoptosis via targeting the de novo fatty acid synthesis is likely through a caspase-3 dependent mechanism coupled with modulation of FASN and β-catenin expressions.",Quercetin,60.555350553505534

So far, no molecularly targeted therapeutic agents have been clinically approved for TNBC. It is imperative that we discover new targets for TNBC therapy. Objectives:A large volume of cancer genomics data are emerging and advancing breast cancer research. We may integrate different types of TNBC genomic data to discover molecular targets for TNBC therapy. Data sources:We used publicly available TNBC tumor tissue genomic data in the Cancer Genome Atlas database in this study. Methods:We integratively explored genomic profiles (gene expression, copy number, methylation, microRNA [miRNA], and gene mutation) in TNBC and identified hyperactivated genes that have higher expression, more copy numbers, lower methylation level, or are targets of miRNAs with lower expression in TNBC than in normal samples. We ranked the hyperactivated genes into different levels based on all the genomic evidence and performed functional analyses of the sets of genes identified. More importantly, we proposed potential molecular targets for TNBC therapy based on the hyperactivated genes. Results:Some of the genes we identified such as FGFR2, MAPK13, TP53, SRC family, MUC family, and BCL2 family have been suggested to be potential targets for TNBC treatment. Others such as CSF1R, EPHB3, TRIB1, and LAD1 could be promising new targets for TNBC treatment. By utilizing this integrative analysis of genomic profiles for TNBC, we hypothesized that some of the targeted treatment strategies for TNBC currently in development are more likely to be promising, such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, while the others are more likely to be discouraging, such as angiogenesis inhibitors. Limitations:The findings in this study need to be experimentally validated in the future. Conclusion:This is a systematic study that combined 5 different types of genomic data to molecularly characterize TNBC and identify potential targets for TNBC therapy. The integrative analysis of genomic profiles for TNBC could assist in identifying potential new therapeutic targets and predicting the effectiveness of a targeted treatment strategy for TNBC therapy.",FGFR2,60.555350553505534

Here, we report that high expression of the sortilin (SORT1) receptor correlates with the decreased survival in TNBC patients, and more importantly in those bearing lymph node metastases. By exploiting SORT1 function in ligand internalization, a new anticancer treatment strategy was designed to target SORT1‐positive TNBC‐derived cells both in vitro and in two in vivo tumor xenografts models. A peptide (TH19P01), which requires SORT1 for internalization and to which many anticancer drugs could be conjugated, was developed. In vitro, while the TH19P01 peptide itself did not exert any antiproliferative or apoptotic effects, the docetaxel‐TH19P01 conjugate (TH1902) exerted potent antiproliferative and antimigratory activities when tested on TNBC‐derived MDA‐MB‐231 cells. TH1902 triggered faster and more potent apoptotic cell death than did unconjugated docetaxel. The apoptotic and antimigratory effects of TH1902 were both reversed by two SORT1 ligands, neurotensin and progranulin, and on siRNA‐mediated silencing of SORT1. TH1902 also altered microtubule polymerization and triggered the downregulation of the anti‐apoptotic Bcl‐xL biomarker. In vivo, both i.p. and i.v. administrations of TH1902 led to greater tumor regression in two MDA‐MB‐231 and HCC‐70 murine xenograft models than did docetaxel, without inducing neutropenia. Altogether, the data demonstrates the high in vivo efficacy and safety of TH1902 against TNBC through a SORT1 receptor‐mediated mechanism. This property allows for selective treatment of SORT1‐positive TNBC and makes TH1902 a promising avenue for personalized therapy with the potential of improving the therapeutic window of cytotoxic anticancer drugs such as docetaxel.",TH1902,60.055350553505534

Then, we examined the effects of dinutuximab on TNBC cell adhesion, migration, and mammosphere formation in vitro and on tumor growth in vivo using TNBC cell-line and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Results We found that GD2 was expressed in around 60% of primary TNBC tumors at variable levels and was associated with worse overall survival of patients with TNBC (p=0.002). GD2 was found to be expressed in tumors and stroma, but normal ducts and lobules in adjacent tissues have shown low or no GD2 staining, indicating that GD2 is potentially a novel biomarker for tumor and its microenvironment. Treatment with dinutuximab significantly decreased adhesion and migration of MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 TNBC cells. Moreover, dinutuximab treatment inhibited mTOR signaling, which has been shown to be regulated by GD2 in BCSCs. Dinutuximab also reduced tumor growth in nude mice bearing TNBC cell-line xenografts. Finally, dinutuximab in combination with activated natural killer cells inhibited tumor growth in a TNBC PDX model and improved overall survival of tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions Dinutuximab successfully eliminated GD2+ cells and reduced tumor growth in both in vivo models. Our data provide proof-of-concept for the criticality of GD2 in BCSCs and demonstrate the potential of dinutuximab as a novel therapeutic approach for TNBC.",dinutuximab,60.055350553505534

Although patients with TNBC show sensitivity to some chemotherapy regimens, in early-stage disease greater emphasis is placed on locoregional treatments, based on surgery and radiation therapy (RT). Ongoing improvements in both screening and surgical techniques have reduced the need for radical surgical intervention in all breast cancers, and breast-conserving surgery (BCS) followed by RT is now increasingly common for all tumour types. However, while evidence has clearly established the importance of post-surgical RT for favourable long-term outcomes in breast cancer, it is less well-established as to where and under which conditions more radical surgeries than BCS, such as modified radical mastectomy (MRM), may be indicated for TNBC. A high proportion of TNBC tumours are BRCA1-mutated and therefore patients with this type of tumour are at a potentially elevated risk of ipsilateral or contralateral recurrence. In addition, while some studies indicate that post-BCS locoregional TNBC relapse rates generally appear similar to other tumour types, some evidence suggests that distant relapse rates may be higher. There is evidence that some subtypes of TNBC may require MRM rather than BCS for optimal long-term outcomes. More research is needed to establish whether TNBC-specific approaches to locoregional treatment may be required.",radiation,59.555350553505534

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype with low survival rate and a lack of biomarkers and targeted treatments. Here, we target pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a key metabolic component of oncogenesis. In patients with TNBC, PKM2pS37 was identified as a prominent phosphoprotein corresponding to the aggressive breast cancer phenotype that showed a characteristic nuclear staining pattern and prognostic value. Phosphorylation of PKM2 at S37 was connected with a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) pathway in TNBC cells. In parallel, pyruvate kinase activator TEPP-46 bound PKM2pS37 and reduced its nuclear localization. In a TNBC mouse xenograft model, treatment with either TEPP-46 or the potent CDK inhibitor dinaciclib reduced tumor growth and diminished PKM2pS37. Combinations of dinaciclib with TEPP-46 reduced cell invasion, impaired redox balance, and triggered cancer cell death. Collectively, these data support an approach to identify PKM2pS37-positive TNBC and target the PKM2 regulatory axis as a potential treatment.

Radioresistance and stemness are substantial obstacles to TNBC treatment. The THO complex (THOC) is a subunit of the TRanscription–EXport complex that functions in the coupling of transcription to nascent RNA splicing, elongation, and export. However, its role in regulating TNBC therapeutic resistance is not reported yet. In this study, the authors demonstrate that cancer stem cells are enriched in radioresistant TNBC cells and describe the role of the THOC in regulating TNBC radioresistance and stemness. The authors find that THOC2 and THOC5 are upregulated in radioresistant TNBC cells and associated with a poor prognosis in TNBC patients. Further investigation reveals that THOC2 promotes the stem‐like properties and radioresistance of TNBC cells in a THOC5‐dependent manner by facilitating the release of sex‐determining region Y (SRY)‐box transcription factor 2 (SOX2) and homeobox transcription factor (NANOG) transcripts from the nucleus. Silencing THOC2 or THOC5 expression decreases the protein expression of SOX2 and NANOG, depletes the stem‐like properties, and causes radiosensitization in these TNBC cells. Moreover, THOC2 or THOC5 depletion blocks the xenograft tumorigenesis and growth of radioresistant TNBC in vivo. These findings uncover the novel correlations of THOC with TNBC stemness and therapeutic resistance, proposing alternative therapeutic strategies against relapsed TNBC.",THOC2,59.055350553505534

Three principal characteristics of TNBC cells are (i) extreme aggressiveness, (ii) absence of hormones, and (iii) growth factor receptors. Due to the lack or poor expression of the estrogen receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and progesterone receptor, TNBC is resistant to hormones and endocrine therapies. Consequently, chemotherapy is currently used as the primary approach against TNBC. Expression of androgen receptor (AR) in carcinoma cells has been observed in a subset of patients with TNBC; therefore, inhibiting androgen signaling pathways holds promise for TNBC targeting. The new AR inhibitors have opened up new therapy possibilities for BC patients carrying AR-positive TNBC cells. Our group provides a comprehensive review of the structure and function of the AR and clinical evidence for targeting the cell’s nuclear receptor in TNBC. We updated AR agonists, inhibitors, and antagonists.

Among its subtypes, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has the worst prognosis. With the increasing number of diagnosed TNBC patients, the urgent need of novel biomarkers is also rising. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) has recently emerged as a key regulator associated with ferroptosis and cuproptosis (FAC) and has exhibited a significant effect on BRCA, but its detailed mechanism remains elusive. Herein, we conducted the first converge comprehensive landscape analysis of FAC-related gene CDKN2A in BRCA and disclosed its prognostic value in BRCA. Then, an unsupervised cluster analysis based on CDKN2A-correlated genes unveiled three subtypes, namely cold-immune subtype, IFN-γ activated subtype and FTL-dominant subtype. Subsequent analyses depicting hallmarks of tumor microenvironment (TME) among three subtypes suggested strong association between TNBC and CDKN2A. Given the fact that the most clinically heterogeneous TNBC always displayed the most severe outcomes and lacked relevant drug targets, we further explored the potential of immunotherapy for TNBC by interfering CDKN2A and constructed the CDKN2A-derived prognostic model for TNBC patients by Lasso-Cox. The 21-gene–based prognostic model showed high accuracy and was verified in external independent validation cohort.

Due to its lack of therapeutic targets, it has historically been treated with single agent chemotherapy, with combination cytotoxic therapy typically reserved for patients with high disease burdens, symptomatic disease, and/or impending visceral crisis. Recent molecular analyses have revealed that this clinical group of TNBCs is in fact quite biologically heterogeneous, with multiple TNBC subtypes defined by distinct biology and clinical behavior. Building on this biology, 2 targeted strategies are now approved for selected patients with advanced TNBC: the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors for advanced TNBC with a germline mutation in BRCA1/2, and the combination of the programmed death ligand 1-specific antibody atezolizumab with nab-paclitaxel for advanced TNBC that expresses programmed death ligand 1 on immune cells within the tumor.

In the present study, we investigated how berberine, a natural isoquinoline, impairs the survival of TNBC cells in both cellular and molecular levels. Our experimental model was based on the use of eight TNBC cell lines: MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, HCC70, HCC38, HCC1937, HCC1143, BT-20, and BT-549. Berberine was cytotoxic against all treated TNBC cell lines. The most sensitive cell lines were HCC70 (IC50 = 0.19 µM), BT-20 (IC50 = 0.23 µM) and MDA-MB-468 (IC50 = 0.48 µM). Using flow cytometry techniques, berberine, at 0.5 and 1 µM for 120 and 144 h, not only induced cell cycle arrest, at G1 and/or G2/M phases, but it also triggered significant apoptosis. At the molecular level, these results are consistent with the expression of their related proteins using Western blot assays. Interestingly, while berberine was cytotoxic against TNBC cells, it had no effect on the viability of normal human breast cells MCF10A cultured in a 3D matrigel model. These results suggest that berberine may be a good potential candidate for TNBC drug development.",berberine,58.555350553505534

However, the utility of CEA and CA15-3 levels as conventional cancer biomarkers in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains controversial. The current study was performed to explore the predictive value of pre-therapeutic serum CEA and CA15-3 levels, and nomograms were developed including these serum cancer biomarkers to improve the prognostic evaluation of TNBC patients. Pre-therapeutic CA15-3 and CEA concentrations were measured in 247 patients with stage I–IV TNBC. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that TNBC patients with high levels of both CEA and CA15-3 had shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates than those in the low-level groups (p<0.05). Multivariate analysis suggested that pre-therapeutic CA15-3 and CEA levels are independent predictive elements for OS (p = 0.022 and p = 0.040, respectively) and DFS (p = 0.023 and p = 0.028, respectively). In addition, novel nomograms were established and validated to provide personal forecasts of OS and DFS for patients with TNBC.

The identification of genomic aberrations that drive each of the TNBC subtypes may predict the prognosis of patients with TNBC and provide novel therapeutic strategies in clinical practice. This study focuses on the transcriptome-based gene expression of TNBC and aims to generate comprehensive gene co-expression networks correlated with the immune-related subtype of TNBC. Methods: The transcriptome profiles of 107 female patients with TNBC were analyzed. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied to construct related networks and to sort hub-genes associated with the survival of TNBC patients. The data of the transcriptional expression, genomic alteration, survival status, and tumor immune microenvironment, which associated with hub-genes, were extracted, retrieved, and analyzed from Oncomine, UALCAN, TCGA, starBase, Kaplan–Meier Plotter, cBioPortal, and TIMER databases. Results: Immune-related hub-genes, including BIRC3, BTN3A1, CSF2RB, GIMAP7, GZMB, HCLS1, LCP2, and SELL, were found to be associated with clinical features of TNBC evaluated by WGCNA. These hub-genes belonged to the immunomodulatory subtype of TNBC and were upregulated in the TNBC cells. The protein expression of eight immune-related hub-genes was further confirmed to be upregulated in TNBC/CD8+ tissues detected by immunohistochemical staining. Survival analysis revealed that overexpression of eight immune-related hub-genes was in favor of the survival of patients with TNBC. Moreover, a positive correlation between eight immune-related hub-genes and immune cell infiltration was observed in TNBC patients. Furthermore, checkpoint inhibitor genes such as PD-L1, PD-1, and CTLA4 were more enrichment in the immunomodulatory subtype of TNBC and the expression of PD-L1, PD-1, and CTLA4 was positively correlated with eight immune-related hub-genes in the breast cancer dataset of TCGA. Conclusions: Eight immune-related hub-genes were identified to be molecular signatures in the immunomodulatory subtype of TNBC, which may provide therapeutic targets for the treatment of patients with breast cancer.",PD-L1,57.555350553505534

Six of the 26 genes tested (VEGFA, SRC, PARP1, PTK2, RAF1, and FGFR3) were significantly upregulated in 13% to 46% of the TNBCs. None of the 6 genes was specifically upregulated in the TNBCs compared with 3 other classical breast tumor subtypes. No association was observed between overexpression of these 6 genes (except for FGFR3) and PIK3CA mutation status.

Such transfer, but with less efficiency, can be carried out over short distances using tunneling nanotubes. In addition, we showed that exosome fractions carrying mitochondria from resistant TNBC cells contribute to acquired chemoresistance by increasing mtDNA levels with mutations in the mtND4 gene responsible for tumorigenesis.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can transport miR-106a-5p into TNBC cells via exosomes. Functional analysis showed exo-miR-106a-5p secreted by MSCs promoted tumor progression in TNBC cells. Furthermore, lncRNA HAND2-AS1 inhibited miR-106a-5p levels, and HAND2-AS1 was decreased in TNBC tissues and cells. Besides, overexpression of HAND2-AS1 reduced the secretion of exo-miR-106a-5p secretion from MSCs, thus suppressed TNBC development. Conclusion: Our study revealed that HAND2-AS1 inhibited the growth of TNBC, which were mediated by the inhibitory effects of MSC-derived exosomal miR-106a-5p.",HAND2-AS1,56.555350553505534

Inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 have been approved for treatment of hormone receptor–positive breast cancers. In contrast, triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are resistant to CDK4/6 inhibition. Here, we demonstrate that a subset of TNBC critically requires CDK4/6 for proliferation, and yet, these TNBC are resistant to CDK4/6 inhibition due to sequestration of CDK4/6 inhibitors into tumor cell lysosomes. This sequestration is caused by enhanced lysosomal biogenesis and increased lysosomal numbers in TNBC cells. We developed new CDK4/6 inhibitor compounds that evade the lysosomal sequestration and are efficacious against resistant TNBC. We also show that coadministration of lysosomotropic or lysosome-destabilizing compounds (an antibiotic azithromycin, an antidepressant siramesine, an antimalaria compound chloroquine) renders resistant tumor cells sensitive to currently used CDK4/6 inhibitors. Lastly, coinhibition of CDK2 arrested proliferation of CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant cells. These observations may extend the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors to TNBCs that are refractory to current anti-CDK4/6 therapies.",CDK4/6,56.555350553505534

Thus, it is imperative to search for novel drug candidates with potent anti-TNBC effects. Recent studies suggest that isoliquiritigenin (ISL) can significantly suppress the growth, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells. We previously synthesized ISL derivatives and found that 3′,4′,5′,4″-tetramethoxychalcone (TMC) inhibits TNBC cell proliferation to a greater degree than ISL. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the anti-TNBC effects of TMC in vitro and in vivo. We show that TMC significantly inhibits the proliferative, migratory, and invasive abilities of MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells. TMC induces apoptosis through the upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2. PCR arrays demonstrate a significant decrease in miR-374a expression in TNBC cells after 24-h TMC treatment. MiR-374a is overexpressed in TNBC cells and has oncogenic properties. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed that TMC inhibits miR-374a in a dose-dependent manner, and luciferase assays confirmed that BAX is targeted by miR-374a. Further, we show that TMC increases Bax protein and mRNA levels by inhibiting miR-374a. TMC also attenuates TNBC tumor volumes and weights in vivo. These results demonstrate that TMC inhibits TNBC cell proliferation, foci formation, migration, invasion, and tumorigenesis, suggesting its potential to serve as a novel drug for treating TNBC through miR-374a repression.",TMC,56.555350553505534

Treatment of TNBC is more challenging than other subtypes of breast cancer due to the lack of markers for the molecularly targeted therapies (ER, PR, and HER-2/ Neu), the conventional chemotherapeutic agents are still the mainstay of the therapeutic protocols of its patients. Despite, TNBC being more chemo-responsive than other subtypes, unfortunately, the initial good response to the chemotherapy eventually turns into a refractory drug-resistance. Using a monotherapy for the treatment of cancer, especially high-grade tumors like TNBC, is mostly worthless due to the inherent genetic instability of tumor cells to develop intrinsic and acquired resistance. Thus, a cocktail of two or more drugs with different mechanisms of action is more effective and could successfully control the disease. Furthermore, combination therapy reveals more, or at least the same, effectiveness with lower doses of each single agent and decreases the likelihood of chemoresistance.

Our results showed that the phosphorylation of c‑Jun N‑terminal protein kinase (JNK) and c‑Jun was increased after STC‑1 treatment but not the phosphorylation of ERK and p38 MAPKs in the Hs578T and MDA‑MB‑231 TNBC cells. Furthermore, expression of one invasion‑related gene MMP‑9, was increased by STC‑1 treatment. STC‑1‑induced MMP‑9 expression was suppressed by SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) in the Hs578T cells.

We previously demonstrated involvement of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor entinostat in regulating apoptosis in IBC and TNBC cells; here, we aimed to identify novel combination therapy candidates. Experimental Design: Potential therapeutic targets were identified by mRNA expression profiling of TNBC and IBC cells treated with entinostat. Drug action and synergism were assessed by in vitro proliferation assays, tumor growth in vivo, and proteomic analyses. Gain/loss-of-expression studies were utilized to functionally validate the role of identified targets in sensitivity of TNBC and IBC cells to combination therapy. Results: Entinostat induced activity of the oncogenic ERK pathway and expression of proapoptotic NOXA. These are known to stabilize and degrade, respectively, MCL1, an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein. In breast cancer patients, high-MCL1/low-NOXA tumor expression correlated significantly with poor survival outcomes. Combination treatment of entinostat with MEK inhibitor pimasertib reduced the growth of TNBC and IBC cells in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. The synergistic action of combination therapy was observed in TNBC and IBC cell lines in which NOXA expression was induced following entinostat treatment. The therapeutic activity depended on induction of mitochondrial cell death pathways initiated by NOXA-mediated MCL1 degradation. Conclusions: Our preclinical findings provide a rationale for the clinical testing of combination HDAC and MEK pathway inhibition for TNBC and IBC that exhibit elevated baseline tumor MCL1 expression.

To date, platinum-based chemotherapy has played a significant role in the treatment of TNBC patients. However, some patients do not respond to platinum salts or gradually develop chemoresistance, resulting in little effect, or even some adverse effects. Here, we review numerous preclinical and clinical investigations to summarize possible mechanisms and potential predictive biomarkers of platinum in TNBC. The homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) resulting from the loss of BRCA function is the main rationale of platinum efficacy in TNBC. BRCA mutation and methylation have been demonstrated to be important potential biomarkers. Based on genome-wide effects, BRCA-like classifier can identify the functional loss of BRCA and work as the predictor. HRD score that is able to identify the “BRCAness” and predict the sensitivity of platinum is increasingly considered. Taken together, all findings suggest that HR deficiency profile encompassed by BRCA mutation and high HRD score could predict response to platinum, even to other DNA-damage inducing agents. p53 family members and molecular subtypes of TNBC are also important alternative considerations for predicting platinum response based on the preclinical trials. Currently, tumor infiltrating lymphocyte level and thrombocytopenia are emerging as predictive biomarkers.",platinum,56.055350553505534

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), lacking expression of hormone and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 receptors, is an aggressive subtype that frequently metastasizes to the brain and has no FDA-approved systemic therapies. Previous literature demonstrates mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) pathway activation in TNBC brain metastases. Thus, we aimed to discover rational combinatorial therapies with MEK inhibition, hypothesizing that co-inhibition using clinically available brain-penetrant inhibitors would improve survival in preclinical models of TNBC brain metastases.

Using human-derived TNBC cell lines, synthetic lethal small interfering RNA kinase screens were evaluated with brain-penetrant inhibitors against MEK1/2 (selumetinib, AZD6244) or phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K; buparlisib, BKM120). Mice bearing intracranial TNBC tumors (SUM149, MDA-MB-231Br, MDA-MB-468, or MDA-MB-436) were treated with MEK, PI3K, or platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR; pazopanib) inhibitors alone or in combination. Tumors were analyzed by western blot and multiplexed kinase inhibitor beads/mass spectrometry to assess treatment effects.


Results
Screens identified MEK+PI3K and MEK+PDGFR inhibitors as tractable, rational combinations. Dual treatment of selumetinib with buparlisib or pazopanib was synergistic in TNBC cells in vitro. Both combinations improved survival in intracranial SUM149 and MDA-MB-231Br, but not MDA-MB-468 or MDA-MB-436. Treatments decreased mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and PI3K (Akt) signaling in sensitive (SUM149 and 231Br) but not resistant models (MDA-MB-468). Exploratory analysis of kinome reprogramming in SUM149 intracranial tumors after MEK ± PI3K inhibition demonstrates extensive kinome changes with treatment, especially in MAPK pathway members.


Conclusions
Results demonstrate that rational combinations of the clinically available inhibitors selumetinib with buparlisib or pazopanib may prove to be promising therapeutic strategies for the treatment of some TNBC brain metastases. Additionally, effective combination treatments cause widespread alterations in kinase pathways, including targetable potential resistance drivers.",selumetinib,56.055350553505534

To identify potential therapeutic targets for TNBC, we conducted microRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) in human TNBC specimens and tumor-matched controls. We found that growth differentiation factor-10 (GDF10), a member of the TGF-β superfamily, was downregulated in tumor samples. Further analysis of GDF10 expression in a larger set of clinical TNBC samples using qPCR confirmed its downregulation and association with parameters of disease severity. Using human-derived TNBC cell lines, we carried out GDF10 under- and overexpression experiments, which showed that GDF10 loss promoted cell proliferation and invasion. By contrast, overexpression of GDF10 inhibited proliferation, invasion, and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) via upregulation of Smad7 and E-Cadherin, downregulation of p-Smad2 and N-Cadherin, and reduction of nuclear Smad4 expression. In addition, overexpression of GDF10 reduced tumor burden and induced apoptosis in a TNBC xenograft mouse model. These findings indicate that GDF10 acts as a tumor suppressor in mammary epithelial cells that limits proliferation and suppresses EMT. Efforts aimed at restoring GDF10 expression may thus bring a long-sought therapeutic alternative in the treatment of patients with TNBC.",GDF10,56.055350553505534

Approximately 10-15% of all breast tumors are triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC have a higher risk of relapse and distant metastases compared to other subtypes. The optimal systemic management of TNBC according to national and international guidelines is discussed herein.


Summary
Anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy for patients with TNBC either in the neoadjuvant (NACT) or the adjuvant setting is considered standard of care. Exceptions are small tumors and a low-risk histology, in which chemotherapy can be spared. Dose-dense therapy is more effective in preventing recurrence and increasing survival. The use of nab-paclitaxel instead of a solvent-based taxane can lead to higher pathological complete response (pCR) rates and better outcomes. Platinum agents are effective in increasing pCR when added to anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy at the cost of increased toxicity. Long-term outcome data are lacking. In patients without a pCR, capecitabine leads to improved outcomes.


Key Messages
The standard treatment approach of TNBC is anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy, preferably within the NACT setting. Dose-dense schedules as well as platinum should be considered in the NACT setting. For patients without a pCR, capecitabine is an option to improve the outcome. The role of nab-paclitaxel is under debate. In case of immunogenic tumors, checkpoint inhibitors are promising new agents that merit further investigation.",capecitabine,55.555350553505534

MYC is one of the most powerful oncogenes and is known to be associated with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Its DNA amplification is often part of the targeted DNA-sequencing panels under the assumption of reflecting upregulated signaling. However, it remains unclear if MYC DNA amplification is a surrogate of its upregulated signaling. Thus, we investigated the difference between MYC DNA amplification and mRNA high expression in TNBCs utilizing publicly available cohorts. MYC DNA amplified tumors were found to have various mRNA expression levels, suggesting that MYC DNA amplification does not always result in elevated MYC mRNA expression. Compared to other subtypes, both MYC DNA amplification and mRNA high expression were more frequent in the TNBCs. MYC mRNA high expression, but not DNA amplification, was significantly associated with worse overall survival in the TNBCs. The TNBCs with MYC mRNA high expression enriched MYC target genes, cell cycle related genes, and WNT/β-catenin gene sets, whereas none of them were enriched in MYC DNA amplified TNBCs. In conclusion, MYC mRNA high expression, but not DNA amplification, reflects not only its upregulated signaling pathway, but also clinical significance in TNBCs.",MYC,55.055350553505534

By chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays, we found that HOXC8 functioned as a transcription factor to activate the transcription of matrix Gla protein (MGP) gene, leading to an increase in the proliferation, anchorage‐independent growth, and migration of TNBC cells. We further demonstrated that MGP expression promoted the epithelial‐mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of TNBC cells, but not the other subtypes of breast cancer, suggesting that MGP induced EMT to promote proliferation and migration of TNBC cells. Moreover, we found that MGP was upregulated in clinical breast specimens compared to normal breast tissues and high MGP expression was statistically associated with poor, relapse‐free survival for TNBC patients, indicating that MGP is probably a novel biomarker or therapeutic target for TNBC patients. Together, our results showed that the HOXC8‐MGP axis played an important role in the tumorigenesis of TNBC and might be a promising therapeutic target for TNBC treatment.",MGP,55.055350553505534
Possible Beneficial Effects of N-Acetylcysteine for Treatment of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,"[{'authorId': '7632463', 'name': 'Y.

However, the cancer-promoting effect of NAC observed in some preclinical studies has raised concerns regarding its clinical use. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can mediate signaling that results in both cancer-promoting and cancer-suppressing effects. The beneficial effect of NAC may depend on whether the type of cancer relies on ROS signaling for its survival and metastasis. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has aggressive phenotypes and is currently treated with standard chemotherapy as the main systemic treatment option. Particularly, basal-like TNBC cells characterized by inactivated BRCA1 and mutated TP53 produce high ROS levels and rely on ROS signaling for their survival and malignant progression. In addition, the high ROS levels in TNBC cells can mediate the interplay between cancer cells and the tissue microenvironment (TME) to trigger the recruitment and conversion of stromal cells and induce hypoxic responses, thus leading to the creation of cancer-supportive TMEs and increased cancer aggressiveness. However, NAC treatment effectively reduces the ROS production and ROS-mediated signaling that contribute to cell survival, metastasis, and drug resistance in TNBC cells. Therefore, the inclusion of NAC in standard chemotherapy could probably provide additional benefits for TNBC patients.",N-acetylcysteine,55.055350553505534

Moreover, TNBC cell lines had greater sensitivity to single-agent DFMO, and ODC levels were elevated in TNBC patient samples.

However, the mechanism by which c-MET contributes to acquired resistance to PARPi in TNBC is not fully understood. In this study, we show that hyperactivated c-Met is detected in TNBC cells with acquired resistance to PARPi, and the combination of talazoparib and crizotinib (a multi-kinase inhibitor that inhibits c-MET) synergistically inhibits proliferation in these cells. Unexpectedly, depleting c-MET had limited effect on talazoparib sensitivity in PARPi-resistant cells. Interestingly, we found evidence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) hyperactivation and interaction of EGFR/c-Met in these cells. Notably, combining EGFR and PARP inhibitors resulted in greater inhibition of proliferation in c-MET-depleted TNBC cells, and combined c-MET and EGFR inhibition increased sensitivity to talazoparib in TNBC cells with acquired resistance to PARPi. Our findings suggest that combined inhibition of c-MET and EGFR could potentially re-sensitize TNBC to the cytotoxic effects of PARPi.",crizotinib,54.555350553505534

We found that TF is aberrantly present in large percentage of aggressive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PaC), two most lethal forms of malignancy that urgently need effective treatment. TF expression in TNBC clustered with higher levels of vimentin, basal-type keratins KRT5/14 and caveolin-1 but lower levels of luminal-type biomarkers. We developed a novel and specific anti-TF therapeutic antibody SC1, which displayed an exceedingly high potency against TF extracellular domain (EC50: 0.019 nM), TF-positive TNBC- or PaC cells (EC50: 2.5 nM), intracellular protease activated receptor 2 (PAR2) signaling (IC50: 2-3 nM) and tumor-initiated coagulation (IC50: <10 nM). Depletion of TF or SC1-treatment in TNBC or PaC cells inhibited TF-induced cell migration, lung metastasis and tumor growth in vivo, accompanied by diminished levels of tumor angiogenesis and stromal fibrosis. We further propose TF as a promising target for antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) development based on its rapid and efficient internalization of SC1-drug conjugate. Both SC1-DM1 and SC1-MMAE elicited exquisite cytotoxicity in TF-positive TNBC and PaC cells (IC50: 0.02-0.1 nM) but not in TF-negative cells (>100 nM) achieving >5000 fold target selectivity. Following a weekly intravenous administration, SC1-MMAE and its humanized hSC1-MMAE inhibited TNBC- and PaC tumor growth achieving MED of 0.3-1 mg/kg and were both well tolerated. Thus, the prevalent TF expression in TNBC and PaC renders these challenging tumors highly susceptible to TF-targeted treatment and may offer new opportunity in cancer patients.",SC1,54.055350553505534

Treatment with CYC065 and eribulin in combination had a superior effect on decreasing cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and inhibiting migration in TNBC cell lines in vitro. Combination therapy inhibited non-canonical Smad3 phosphorylation at the T179 site in the protein linker region, and resulted in increased p15 and decreased c-myc expression. In a transcription factor array, combination treatment significantly increased activity of AP1 and decreased activity of factors including NFκB, SP1, E2F, and SMAD3. In an in vivo xenograft model of TNBC, individual and combination treatments resulted in a decrease in both tumor volume and mitotic indices.

Growing evidence has shown that breast cancer stem cells are associated with tumor initiation and metastasis and may play a critical role in chemoresistance. Multiple targets against breast cancer stem cells are now under investigation. Recent advances in the role of breast cancer stem cells in triple negative breast cancer and the identification of cancer stem cell biomarkers have paved the way for the development of new targeted therapies. The discovery of potential molecular signaling pathways targeting breast cancer stem cells to overcome chemoresistance and prevent metastasis will improve the overall survival of patients with triple negative breast cancer. Abstract Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains an aggressive disease due to the lack of targeted therapies and low rate of response to chemotherapy that is currently the main treatment modality for TNBC. Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are a small subpopulation of breast tumors and recognized as drivers of tumorigenesis. TNBC tumors are characterized as being enriched for BCSCs. Studies have demonstrated the role of BCSCs as the source of metastatic disease and chemoresistance in TNBC. Multiple targets against BCSCs are now under investigation, with the considerations of either selectively targeting BCSCs or co-targeting BCSCs and non-BCSCs (majority of tumor cells). This review article provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the role of BCSCs in TNBC and the identification of cancer stem cell biomarkers, paving the way for the development of new targeted therapies. The review also highlights the resultant discovery of cancer stem cell targets in TNBC and the ongoing clinical trials treating chemoresistant breast cancer. We aim to provide insights into better understanding the mutational landscape of BCSCs and exploring potential molecular signaling pathways targeting BCSCs to overcome chemoresistance and prevent metastasis in TNBC, ultimately to improve the overall survival of patients with this devastating disease.",chemotherapy,54.055350553505534

However, we, and others, have demonstrated that approximately 30% of TNBCs express estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), a nuclear hormone receptor and potential drug target. Treatment of ERβ expressing MDA-MB-231 cells with estrogen or the ERβ selective agonist, LY500307, was shown to result in suppression of cell proliferation. This inhibitory effect was due to blockade of cell cycle progression. In vivo, estrogen treatment significantly repressed the growth of ERβ expressing MDA-MB-231 cell line xenografts. Gene expression studies and ingenuity pathway analysis identified a network of ERβ down-regulated genes involved in cell cycle progression including CDK1, cyclin B and cyclin H. siRNA mediated knockdown or drug inhibition of CDK1 and CDK7 in TNBC cells resulted in substantial decreases in proliferation regardless of ERβ expression. These data suggest that the tumor suppressive effects of ERβ in TNBC result from inhibition of cell cycle progression, effects that are in part mediated by suppression of CDK1/7. Furthermore, these data indicate that blockade of CDK1/7 activity in TNBC may be of therapeutic benefit, an area of study that has yet to be explored.",CDK1,54.055350553505534

This observation is further investigated in vivo. GDC-0941 exhibited minimal tumor inhibition in MDA-MB-231 cells, but it significantly suppressed tumor growth in HER-positive SK-BR3 cells. In vivo mechanism study revealed the activation of WNT/beta-catenin pathway by GDC-0941. A synergistic effect was observed when combined treatment with GDC-0941 and the WNT inhibitor LGK974 at low concentrations in MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings indicated that WNT pathway activation conferred resistance in TNBC cells treated with GDC-0941.

Interruption of transcriptional activity using a “unite-and-conquer” strategy sensitizes refractory TNBC to treatment and reduced tumor growth. EGFR-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are potent and specific in suppressing the growth of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in vitro and in vivo. However, in this study, a subset of mice soon acquired resistance, which limits the potential use of EGFR CAR T cells. We aimed to find a way to overcome the observed resistance. Transcriptomic analysis results revealed that EGFR CAR T-cell treatment induced a set of immunosuppressive genes, presumably through IFNγ signaling, in EGFR CAR T-cell–resistant TNBC tumors. The EGFR CAR T-cell–induced immunosuppressive genes were associated with EGFR CAR T-cell–activated enhancers and were especially sensitive to THZ1, a CDK7 inhibitor we screened out of a panel of small molecules targeting epigenetic modulators. Accordingly, combination therapy with THZ1 and EGFR CAR T cells suppressed immune resistance, tumor growth, and metastasis in TNBC tumor models, including human MDA-MB-231 cell–derived and TNBC patient–derived xenografts, and mouse EMT6 cell–derived allografts.

Another two databases with clinical information were applied for following Kaplan-Meier analysis, and high expression of BIRC5, CENPA and FAM64A in this cohort were found to be related to poor survival (OS, DMFS, DFS and RFS). This correlation was also seen in patients at early stages and grades. On the other hand, the outcome of patients with synchronous upregulation of these three genes was the worst, while those with synchronous low gene level was the best.

Among the 52 consecutive random TNBC cases examined, the expression of SDCBP was consistent with that of p-c-src-Y419, and positively correlated with histological grading or Ki-67 levels. SDCBP overexpression significantly accelerated the proliferation and cell cycle progression of the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231; these effects were prevented by dasatinib treatment. However, the subsequent inhibition of p27 expression partially restored the proliferation and viability of the TNBC cells. The results of this study suggest that SDCBP interacts with c-src, regulates G1/S in TNBC cells, and enhances tumor cell proliferation by promoting the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-src at residue 419. Dasatinib inhibits such phosphorylation and blocks SDCBP-induced cell cycle progression. Therefore, SDCBP might be an important marker for identifying TNBC cases that are suitable for dasatinib therapy.",dasatinib,53.055350553505534

A real‐time polymerase chain reaction assay was used to quantify miR‐135b expression levels in 90 paired TNBC tissue and adjacent normal tissue samples. Wound‐healing and transwell assays were performed to evaluate the effects of miR‐135b expression on the migration and invasion of TNBC cells. Luciferase reporter and western blot analyses were used to verify whether the mRNA encoding APC is a major target of miR‐135b. In the current study, we found that miR‐135b was highly expressed in TNBC tissue and cells, and the expression levels were correlated with lymph node status and TNM stage. In TNBC cells, the ectopic expression of miR‐135b promoted cell proliferation and invasion in vitro. In addition, our study proved that the overexpression of miR‐135b significantly suppressed APC expression by targeting the 3′‐untranslated region of APC, whereas enhanced APC expression could partially abrogate the miR‐135b‐mediated promotion of carcinogenic traits in TNBC cells.

The recent FDA approval for immune checkpoint inhibition in combination with nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of metastatic TNBC created opportunity to advocate for immunotherapy in TNBC patients. However, improving the current low response rates is vital. Most cancers, including TNBC tumors, display metabolic plasticity and undergo reprogramming into highly glycolytic tumors through the Warburg effect. Consequently, accumulation of the metabolic byproduct lactate and extracellular acidification is often observed in several solid tumors, thereby exacerbating tumor cell proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis. In this review, we focus on the role of lactate acidosis in the microenvironment of glycolytic breast tumors as a major driver for immune evasion with a special emphasis on TNBCs. In particular, we will discuss the role of lactate regulators such as glucose transporters, lactate dehydrogenases, and lactate transporters in modulating immune functionality and checkpoint expression in numerous immune cell types. This review aims to spark discussion on interventions targeting lactate acidosis in combination with immunotherapy to provide an effective means of improving response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in TNBC, in addition to highlighting challenges that may arise from TNBC tumor heterogeneity.",lactate,52.555350553505534

The aim of the study was to investigate whether gains and/or amplifications of VEGFR2 and KIT, located at 4q12, occur in TNBC. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to quantify gene copy numbers of VEGFR2 and KIT in 83 primary human breast cancers including 31 TNBCs. Gains were defined as ≥4 gene copies in >40% of the cancer cells, whereas amplification was defined as CEP >2 in more than 10% of the cancer cells. A tumor was considered FISH positive for KIT and/or VEGFR2 if it displayed copy number gain and/or amplification. Ten (32%) of the TNBCs were VEGFR2 FISH positive and nine (29%) were KIT FISH positive, whereas non‐TNBCs were FISH positive for VEGFR2 and KIT in nine (18%) cases for both genes, but no significant difference between TNBCs and non‐TNBCs was found. FISH positivity for VEGFR2 and KIT was significantly correlated (χ2 test, P < 0.001), and significantly related to ER negativity and high Nottingham histological grade (NHG).

TNBC disproportionately affects younger women and women of colour, and new treatments are needed. The opioid growth factor (OGF) – opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr) axis is a determinant of cell proliferation in neoplasia, and OGF is an endogenously produced pentapeptide that inhibits cell replication by interacting with OGFr and upregulating cyclin-dependent inhibitory kinase pathways thus reducing DNA synthesis. In these studies we investigated the presence and function of the OGF-OGFr axis in two human TNBC cell lines, as well as in breast cancer cell lines containing hormonal receptors. TNBC cell lines MDA-MD-231 and BT-20, as well as human breast cancer cells SK-BR-3 and MCF-7, were examined for the presence of pentapeptide and receptors, as well as their response to OGF. Specificity of peptide and receptor was confirmed by antibody neutralization and molecular studies to knockdown classical receptor protein. The requirement for protein transcription and translation and RNA transcription were investigated. Growth of TNBC cells in the presence of OGF and standard of care chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel was evaluated to determine both efficacy and protective effects against toxicity. OGF treatment inhibited TNBC cells in a dosage related, receptor mediated, and reversible manner. OGF was the specific endogenous opioid to inhibit cell proliferation, and this was mediated by p21 cyclin dependent inhibitory kinase pathways, and required protein and RNA synthesis. OGFr was the specific receptor involved; both peptide and receptor were detected in all four cell lines. OGF treatment inhibited growth of all cancer cell lines evaluated, and reduced cell death in cultures exposed to paclitaxel.

The existing hormonal therapies offer limited clinical solutions in completely circumventing the TNBC, with chemoresistance and tumor recurrences being the common hurdles in the path of TNBC treatment. Accumulating evidence has correlated the dysregulation of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) with increased cell proliferation, invasion, migration, tumor growth, chemoresistance, and decreased apoptosis in TNBC. Various clinical studies have revealed that aberrant expression of lncRNAs in TNBC tissues is associated with poor prognosis, lower overall survival, and disease‐free survival. Due to these specific characteristics, lncRNAs have emerged as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for TNBC treatment. However, the underlying mechanism through which lncRNAs perform their actions remains unclear, and extensive research is being carried out to reveal it.

In the present study, the therapeutic potential of carboplatin and Nutlin-3a to treat TNBC was investigated, as carboplatin is under evaluation in clinical trials for TNBC. In mutant p53 TMD231 TNBC cells, carboplatin and Nutlin-3a led to increased Mdm2 and was strongly synergistic in promoting cell death in vitro. Furthermore, sensitivity of TNBC cells to combination treatment was dependent on p73α. Following combination treatment, γH2AX increased and Mdm2 localized to a larger degree to chromatin compared with single-agent treatment, consistent with previous observations that Mdm2 binds to the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex associated with DNA and inhibits the DNA damage response.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 15% to 20% of all invasive breast carcinomas and is defined by the lack of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Although TNBC is characterized by high rates of disease recurrence and worse survival, it is significantly more sensitive to chemotherapy as compared with other breast cancer subtypes. Accordingly, despite great efforts in the genomic characterization of TNBC, chemotherapy still represents the cornerstone of treatment. For the majority of patients with early-stage TNBC, sequential anthracycline- and taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) represents the standard therapeutic approach, with pathological complete response that strongly correlates with long-term survival outcomes. However, some issues about the optimal neoadjuvant regimen, as well as the effective role of chemotherapy in patients with residual disease after NACT, are still debated. Herein, we will review the current evidences that guide the use of (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early-stage TNBC. Furthermore, we will discuss current controversies, including the incorporation of platinum compounds to the neoadjuvant backbone and the optimal treatment for patients with residual disease after NACT. Lastly, we will outline potential future directions that can guide treatment escalation and de-escalation, as well as the development of new therapies. In our view, the application of multi-omics technologies, liquid biopsy assays, and machine learning algorithms are strongly warranted to pave the way toward personalized anticancer treatment for early-stage TNBC.",chemotherapy,52.055350553505534

However, the function and underlying mechanisms of miR-150 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remain unknown. Patients and methods miR-150 expression was detected by qRT-PCR and ISH in TNBC tumor and adjacent normal breast tissues. miR-150 function was analyzed by wound healing and transwell assay in vitro and mouse lung metastasis model in vivo. mRNA microarray, qRT-PCR, western blotting and luciferase assay were used to identify the target gene of miR-150. HMGA2 over-expression plasmid was co-transfected with miR-150 to study the role of miR-150 through regulating HMGA2. Results We found that miR-150 was down-regulated in TNBC tumor tissues compared to corresponding adjacent, normal breast tissues, and was correlated with decreased lymph-node metastasis. Ectopic expression of miR-150 suppressed TNBC cell migration in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistic study revealed that miR-150 down-regulates HMGA2 by directly targeting its mRNA. Moreover, the suppression of cell migration caused by miR-150 is relieved by over-expression of HMGA2, suggesting that miR-150 inhibits migration of TNBC cells by down-regulating HMGA2. Conclusion This work indicates that the miR-150/HMGA2 axis may serve as a treatment marker in TNBC.",miR-150,51.555350553505534

Due to these specific characteristics, chemotherapy does not usually yield substantial improvements and new target therapies and alternative strategies are needed. The beneficial responses of TNBC survivors to regular exercise, including a reduction in the rate of tumor growth, are becoming increasingly apparent. Physiological adaptations to exercise occur in skeletal muscle but have an impact on the entire body through systemic control of energy homeostasis and metabolism, which in turn influence the TNBC tumor microenvironment. Gaining insights into the causal mechanisms of the therapeutic cancer control properties of regular exercise is important to improve the prescription and implementation of exercise and training in TNBC survivors. Here, we provide new evidence of the effects of exercise on TNBC prevention, control, and outcomes, based on the inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB also known as Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (PI3K-Akt-mTOR) signaling.

In this study, ZEB1‐AS1 expression was boosted in TNBC tissues and cell lines according to reverse transcription‐quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‐qPCR). Inhibition of ZEB1‐AS1 suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and promoted cell apoptosis in TNBC. Moreover, ZEB1‐AS1 positively regulated ZEB1 expression. RT‐qPCR disclosed ZEB1 expression was elevated in TNBC tissues and ZEB1 silence blocked TNBC progression.

In addition chromatin, immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays confirmed that ZEB1 could bind with ZEB1‐AS1 promoter and promoted ZEB1‐AS1 expression. Rescue assays manifested ZEB1 overexpression could abolish the inhibitory effect caused by ZEB1‐AS1 inhibition on TNBC progression.

Finding novel treatment options with minimum or no toxicity is of great importance in treating or preventing TNBC. Flavonoids are new attractive molecules that might fulfill this promising therapeutic option. Flavonoids have shown many biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. In addition to their anticancer effects by arresting the cell cycle, inducing apoptosis, and suppressing cancer cell proliferation, flavonoids can modulate non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) function. Several preclinical and epidemiological studies indicate the possible therapeutic potential of these compounds. Flavonoids display a unique ability to change miRNAs’ levels via different mechanisms, either by suppressing oncogenic miRNAs or activating oncosuppressor miRNAs or affecting transcriptional, epigenetic miRNA processing in TNBC. Flavonoids are not only involved in the regulation of miRNA-mediated cancer initiation, growth, proliferation, differentiation, invasion, metastasis, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), but also control miRNAs-mediated biological processes that significantly impact TNBC, such as cell cycle, immune system, mitochondrial dysregulation, modulating signaling pathways, inflammation, and angiogenesis. In this review, we highlighted the role of miRNAs in TNBC cancer progression and the effect of flavonoids on miRNA regulation, emphasizing their anticipated role in the prevention and treatment of TNBC.",flavonoids,51.055350553505534

Previous studies examined the general association between alcohol consumption and breast cancer risk; however, the risk for different breast cancer subtypes has been rarely reported. Triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer lacking hormone receptors and HER2 expression, and having poor prognosis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of TNBC etiology remains a significant challenge. In this study, we investigated cellular responses to alcohol in two TNBC cell lines, MDA‐MB‐231 and MDA‐MB‐468. Our results showed that alcohol at low concentrations (0.025–0.1% v/v) induced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in 1% FBS‐containing medium. Molecular analysis indicated that these phenotypic changes were associated with alcohol‐induced reactive oxygen species production and increased p38 and JNK phosphorylation. Likewise, p38 or JNK inhibition attenuated alcohol‐induced cell migration and invasion. We revealed that alcohol treatment activated/phosphorylated NF‐κB regulators and increased transcription of NF‐κB‐targeted genes. While examining the role of acetaldehyde, the major alcohol metabolite, in alcohol‐associated responses in TNBC cells, we saw that acetaldehyde induced cell migration, invasion, and increased phospho‐p38, phospho‐JNK, and phospho‐IκBα in a pattern similar to alcohol treatment. Taken together, we established that alcohol promotes TNBC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. The underlying mechanisms involve the induction of oxidative stress and the activation of NF‐κB signaling. In particular, the activation of p38 and JNK plays a pivotal role in alcohol‐induced cellular responses. These results will advance our understanding of alcohol‐mediated development and promotion of TNBC. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",alcohol,51.055350553505534

However, it shows limited efficacy for human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Bevacizumab shows potent anti-angiogenesis activity, meanwhile, it also increases invasive and metastatic properties of TNBC cells by activiting Wnt/β-Catenin pathway. To overcome this problem, and fully utilize its potency against cancer, further synergistic strategy is recommended to be developed, especially the concurrent use with those Wnt-targeting agents. Here, by screening a small library of traditional Chinese medicine, we identified a Chinese herb derived Oxymatrine, which could target Wnt/β-Catenin signaling and compromise the oncogenic effects of Bevacizumab. Bevacizumab was validated to induce epithelial-mesenchymal cell transformation (EMT) and cancer stem-like properties of TNBC cells in hypoxia/nutritional stress environment. On the contrary, Oxymatrine reversed the EMT phenotype and depleted the subpopulation of TNBC stem cells induced by Bevacizumab. Oxymatrine enhanced the anti-tumor effects of Bevacizumab in vivo, and holded the potential of reducing the risk of relapse and metastasis by impairing the self-renewal ability of TNBC stem cells. The underlying mechanism was elucidated: Bevacizumab stimulated Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway, and Oxymatrine could compromise this effect. On this foundation, factoring into the satisfactory anti-angiogenic activity and low toxicity, Oxymatrine is a good candidate for the synergistic therapy together with Bevacizumab for the treatment of TNBC.",Oxymatrine,51.055350553505534

We analyzed whether inhibition of EGFR by gefitinib reduces the expression of GPER and subsequent signal transduction in TNBC cells. Dependence of proliferation on 17β-estradiol was determined using Alamar Blue assay. Expression of GPR30 and activation of c-src, EGFR and cAMP-responsive element binding (CREB) protein by 17β-estradiol was analyzed by western blotting. Expression of c-fos, cyclin D1 and aromatase was determined using RT-PCR. Gefitinib reduced GPER expression concentration‑ and time‑dependently. In HCC70 cells, GPER expression was reduced to 15±11% (p<0.05) after treatment with 200 nM gefitinib for four days, and in HCC1806 cells GPER expression was reduced to 39±5% (p<0.01) of the control. 17β-estradiol significantly increased the percentage of HCC1806 cells within 7 days to 145±29% of the control (HCC70, 110±8%).

Experimental Design: IHC analyses were conducted on human and PDX-TNBC samples to evaluate the production of the three biomarkers. The sensitivity of cancer cells expressing or not MT4-MMP to anti-EGFR (erlotinib) or anti-CDK4/6 inhibitor (palbociclib) was evaluated in vitro in 2D and 3D proliferation assays and in vivo using xenografts and PDX-TNBC displaying different RB, MT4-MMP, and EGFR status after single (erlotinib or palbociclib) or combined (erlotinib + palbociclib) treatments. Results: EGFR and MT4-MMP were coexpressed in >70% of TNBC samples and PDX-TNBC, among which approximately 60% maintained RB expression. Notably, approximately 50% of all TNBC and PDX-TNBC expressed the three biomarkers. Single erlotinib and palbociclib treatments drastically reduced the in vitro proliferation of cells expressing EGFR and MT4-MMP when compared with control cells. Both TNBC xenografts and PDX expressing MT4-MMP, EGFR, and RB, but not PDX-TNBC with RB loss, were sensitive to erlotinib and palbociclib with an additive effect of combination therapy. Moreover, this combination was efficient in another PDX-TNBC expressing the three biomarkers and resistant to erlotinib alone. Conclusions: We defined a new association of three biomarkers (MT4-MMP/EGFR/RB) expressed together in 50% of TNBC and demonstrated its usefulness to predict the TNBC response to anti-EGFR and anti-CDK4/6 drugs used in single or combined therapy.",erlotinib,50.555350553505534

CSCs are thought to be responsible for tumor initiation and drug resistance. cAMP-response element-binding (CREB) binding protein (CREBBP or CBP) has been implicated in CSC biology and may provide a novel therapeutic target in TNBC. Methods: RNA Seq pre- and post treatment with the CBP-binding small molecule ICG-001 was used to characterize CBP-driven gene expression in TNBC cells. In vitro and in vivo TNBC models were used to determine the therapeutic effect of CBP inhibition via ICG-001. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were used to investigate the potential of CBP and associated proteins as biomarkers in TNBC. Results: The CBP/ß-catenin/FOXM1 transcriptional complex drives gene expression in TNBC and is associated with increased CSC numbers, drug resistance and poor survival outcome. Targeting of CBP/β-catenin/FOXM1 with ICG-001 eliminated CSCs and sensitized TNBC tumors to chemotherapy. Immunohistochemistry of TMAs demonstrated a significant correlation between FOXM1 expression and TNBC subtype.

CERT transfers ceramide from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex for conversion into sphingomyelin (SM). We provide evidence that by regulating cellular SM levels, CERT determines the signaling output of the EGF receptor (EGFR/ErbB1), which is upregulated in approximately 70% of TNBCs. CERT downregulation in breast cancer cells enhanced ErbB1 lateral mobility, ligand-induced autophosphorylation, internalization, and chemotaxis.

Based on a significant improvement in progression-free survival as well as a 10-month improvement in overall survival (on interim analysis) seen in the IMpassion 130 trial, the combination of atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel was approved for patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Areas covered: This article reviews current data and ongoing research on atezolizumab for the treatment of breast cancer. Results of atezolizumab monotherapy trials in the context of other early immune checkpoint blockade trials in breast cancer are discussed as well as data from combination clinical trials with chemotherapy in both early-stage and metastatic breast cancer. We focus on the safety and efficacy analyses from the phase III IMpassion trial that led to FDA and EMA approval of atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel in patients whose tumor tested positive for PD-L1 by the Ventana SP142 companion diagnostic immunohistochemical assay. Expert opinion: The FDA and EMA approvals of atezolizumab mark an important advance for treatment of metastatic TNBC. However, ongoing investigations need to define better biomarkers of response, determine resistance mechanisms, and identify strategies to increase response rates.",atezolizumab,50.555350553505534

However, the anticancer mechanism of RSV on triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains unclear. In the present study, the antitumor effects and mechanism of RSV on TNBC cells were analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), which was then verified via cell counting kit-8 (CCK8), immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, Western Blot (WB), flow cytometry, and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. According to the corresponding findings, the survival rate of MDA-MB-231 cells gradually decreased as RSV treatment concentration increased. The RNA-seq analysis results demonstrated that genes affected by RSV treatment were mainly involved in apoptosis and the p53 signaling pathway. Moreover, apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells induced by RSV was observed to be mainly mediated by POLD1. When treated with RSV, the expression levels of full length PARP1, PCNA, and BCL-2 were found to be significantly reduced, and the expression level of Cleaved-PARP1 as well as Cleaved-Caspase3 increased significantly. Additionally, the mRNA expression of POLD1 was significantly reduced after treatment with RSV, and the protein expression level was also inhibited by RSV in a concentration-dependent manner. The prediction of domain interaction suggested that RSV may bind to at least five functional domains of the POLD1 protein (6s1m, 6s1n, 6s1o, 6tny and 6tnz). Furthermore, after RSV treatment, the anti-apoptotic index (PCNA, BCL-2) of MDA-MB-231 cells was found to decrease while the apoptosis index (caspase3) increased. Moreover, the overexpression of POLD1 reduced the extent of apoptosis observed in MDA-MB-231 cells following RSV treatment. Moreover, animal experimental results showed that RSV had a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of live tumors, while POLD1 overexpression was shown to antagonize this inhibitory effect. Accordingly, this study’s findings reveal that RSV may promote the apoptosis of TNBC cells by reducing the expression of POLD1 to activate the apoptotic pathway, which may serve as a potential therapy for the treatment of TNBC.",Resveratrol,50.055350553505534

Here, we show that p38γ activation promotes TNBC development and progression by stimulating cancer stem‐like cell (CSC) expansion and may serve as a novel therapeutic target. p38γ silencing in TNBC cells reduces mammosphere formation and decreases expression levels of CSC drivers including Nanog, Oct3/4, and Sox2. Moreover, p38γ MAPK‐forced expression alone is sufficient to stimulate CSC expansion and to induce epithelial cell transformation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, p38γ depends on its activity to stimulate CSC expansion and breast cancer progression, indicating a therapeutic opportunity by application of its pharmacological inhibitor. Indeed, the non‐toxic p38γ specific pharmacological inhibitor pirfenidone selectively inhibits TNBC growth in vitro and/or in vivo and significantly decreases the CSC population. Mechanistically, p38γ stimulates Nanog transcription through c‐Jun/AP‐1 via a multi‐protein complex formation. These results together demonstrate that p38γ can drive TNBC development and progression and may be a novel therapeutic target for TNBC by stimulating CSC expansion. Inhibiting p38γ activity with pirfenidone may be a novel strategy for the treatment of TNBC. Stem Cells 2015;33:2738—2747",pirfenidone,50.055350553505534

The current population-based study investigated the early survival pattern of elderly women with TNBC and identified outcome-correlated factors. Patients and Methods We searched the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and enrolled female primary non-metastatic TNBC cases. The patients were subdivided into elderly (≥70 years) and young groups (<70 years). The survival status of elderly patients was compared to that of the younger women. The primary and secondary endpoints were cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) respectively. Results 9908 female TNBC patients diagnosed from 2010 to 2011 were included in the current study (20.4% elderly). Elderly patients with relatively advanced diseases exhibited distinctly worse cancer-specific (log-rank, p<0.001) and overall survival (log-rank, p<0.001) than their young counterparts. Advanced age at diagnosis (≥70 years) was significantly predictive of poor outcome in terms of CSS (hazard ratio (HR), 2.125; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.664 to 2.713; p<0.001) and OS (HR, 3.042; 95%CI, 2.474 to 3.740; p<0.001).

Different mechanisms have been hypothesized to be involved in this phenomenon, including receptor tyrosine kinase‐dependent activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. In this study, we analyzed the effects of the MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib in combination with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib in a panel of TNBC cell lines that showed different levels of sensitivity to single‐agent selumetinib: SUM‐149 and MDA‐MB‐231 cells resulted to be sensitive, whereas SUM‐159, MDA‐MB‐468 and HCC70 cells were relatively resistant to the drug. Treatment of TNBC cells with selumetinib produced an increase of the phosphorylation of the EGFR both in selumetinib‐sensitive SUM‐149, MDA‐MB‐231 and in selumetinib‐resistant MDA‐MB‐468 TNBC cells. The combination of selumetinib and gefitinib resulted in a synergistic growth inhibitory effect in all the TNBC cell lines, although the IC50 was not reached in SUM‐159 and MDA‐MB‐468 cells. This effect was associated with an almost complete suppression of ERK1/2 activation and a reduction of selumetinib‐induced AKT phosphorylation. In addition, in selumetinib‐sensitive TNBC cells the combination of selumetinib and gefitinib induced a significant G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

Patients and Methods We searched the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and enrolled female primary non-metastatic TNBC cases. The patients were subdivided into elderly (≥70 years) and young groups (<70 years). The survival status of elderly patients was compared to that of the younger women. The primary and secondary endpoints were cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) respectively. Results 9908 female TNBC patients diagnosed from 2010 to 2011 were included in the current study (20.4% elderly). Elderly patients with relatively advanced diseases exhibited distinctly worse cancer-specific (log-rank, p<0.001) and overall survival (log-rank, p<0.001) than their young counterparts. Advanced age at diagnosis (≥70 years) was significantly predictive of poor outcome in terms of CSS (hazard ratio (HR), 2.125; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.664 to 2.713; p<0.001) and OS (HR, 3.042; 95%CI, 2.474 to 3.740; p<0.001). Underuse of curative treatment especially radiotherapy was more prevalent in elderly women with stage II or III diseases than in younger patients. Conclusion Elderly patients with TNBC displayed elevated early mortality within the first two years of diagnosis compared to the younger individuals. The observed lower rate of loco-regional treatment might be associated with worse cancer-specific outcome for these patients.",radiotherapy,50.055350553505534

Advances in the treatment of TNBC have been hampered by the lack of novel effective targeted therapies. The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of targeting Aurora kinase A (AurA), a key regulator of mitosis, in TNBC models. A secondary objective was to determine the role of the p53 family of transcriptional regulators, commonly mutated in TNBC, in determining the phenotypic response to the AurA inhibitor alisertib (MLN8237). Alisertib exhibited potent antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity in a subset of TNBC models. The induction of apoptosis in response to alisertib exposure was dependent on p53 and p73 activity. In the absence of functional p53 or p73, there was a shift in the phenotypic response following alisertib exposure from apoptosis to cellular senescence. In addition, senescence was observed in patient-derived tumor xenografts with acquired resistance to alisertib treatment. AurA inhibitors are a promising class of novel therapeutics in TNBC. The role of p53 and p73 in mediating the phenotypic response to antimitotic agents in TNBC may be harnessed to develop an effective biomarker selection strategy in this difficult to target disease.

Monotherapy with prexasertib demonstrated modest activity in BRCA wild-type, recurrent triple-negative breast cancer, highlighting the unmet need for combination treatment strategies. Neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia are common with the use of prexasertib but are manageable with supportive care measures. Prophylactic use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor should be considered to avoid dose reductions or treatment delays. Pharmacodynamic studies showed prexasertib treatment induced DNA damage in peripheral immune cells.


BACKGROUND
Cell cycle checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) is a major G2/M cell cycle regulator in tumors with p53 dysfunction, like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We hypothesized the second-generation CHK1 inhibitor, prexasertib, would yield clinical activity in sporadic TNBC.


METHODS
This single arm, phase II trial evaluated prexasertib at 105 mg/m2 IV every 2 weeks in patients with metastatic/recurrent TNBC. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR).


RESULTS
All nine patients enrolled were germline BRCA wild-type (BRCAwt) and had at least one prior treatment. One partial response (PR) was observed (ORR of 11.1%). Four patients experienced stable disease. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 86 days (range 17 to 159 days). Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events included afebrile neutropenia (n = 8; 88.9%), anemia (n = 3; 33.3%), and thrombocytopenia (n = 1; 11.1%). Pharmacodynamic studies showed prexasertib treatment induced DNA damage in peripheral immune cells and demonstrated decreased activated/reinvigorated CD8 T cells; however, the patient with a PR did show evidence of T-cell recovery.


CONCLUSION
Prexasertib monotherapy had modest clinical efficacy in BRCAwt TNBC. Further studies of the prexasertib in combination with other agents are needed.",prexasertib,49.555350553505534

Biomarkers predictive of response to treatment are thus of great importance in TNBC.

To identify shared and selective vulnerabilities of basal-like TNBC, the most common TNBC subtype, a directed siRNA lethality screen was performed in 7 human breast cancer cell lines, focusing on 154 previously identified dependency genes of 1 TNBC line. Thirty common dependency genes were identified, including multiple proteasome and RNA splicing genes, especially those associated with the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex (e.g., PRPF8, PRPF38A). PRPF8 or PRPF38A knockdown or the splicing modulator E7107 led to widespread intronic retention and altered splicing of transcripts involved in multiple basal-like TNBC dependencies, including protein homeostasis, mitosis, and apoptosis. E7107 treatment suppressed the growth of basal-A TNBC cell line and patient-derived basal-like TNBC xenografts at a well-tolerated dose. The antitumor response was enhanced by adding the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Thus, inhibiting both splicing and the proteasome might be an effective approach for treating basal-like TNBC.

Although TNBC is sensitive to chemotherapy, the recurrence and mortality rates are worse compared with the other breast cancer types. In addition, TNBC still lacks targeted treatment options. With the improved understanding of the immune system in TNBC, it is expected that new predictive and prognostic markers will be identified, and innovative treatment modalities will be developed. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of the effector cells in the TNBC's microenvironment and to highlight a novel approach to treat this kind of cancer. A computer‐based literature research was carried out using PubMed, American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting (ASCO) and San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS). To date, studies have shown that tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) play a very important role in the TNBC's microenvironment. Tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes can even be considered as biomarkers to predict chemotherapy response in TNBC. Furthermore, TNBC was shown to have immune active subtypes, and therefore, the use of immunotherapy may be an attractive treatment approach. In this respect, several randomized studies have been designed or are currently ongoing to explore the combination of chemotherapy with immunotherapy in TNBC. Combination of chemo‐ and immunotherapy is likely to be beneficial in a subgroup of patients with TNBC.",immunotherapy,49.055350553505534

Unlike hormone receptor-positive or HER2-positive breast cancers, there are limited targeted therapies available to treat TNBC and cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment. Sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU-132) is an antibody-drug conjugate targeting Trop-2 expressing cells and selectively delivering SN-38, an active metabolite of irinotecan. Areas covered: This review covers the mechanism of action, safety and efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan in patients with previously treated, metastatic TNBC. Additionally, efficacy data in other epithelial malignancies is included based on a PubMed search for ‘sacituzumab govitecan’ and ‘clinical trial’. Expert opinion: Sacituzumab govitecan has promising anti-cancer activity in patients with metastatic TNBC previously treated with at least two prior lines of systemic therapy based on a single arm Phase I/II clinical trial. A confirmatory Phase III randomized clinical trial is ongoing. Sacituzumab govitecan has a manageable side effect profile, with the most common adverse events being nausea, neutropenia, and diarrhea. The activity of sacituzumab govitecan likely extends beyond TNBC with promising early efficacy data in many other epithelial cancers, including hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.",sacituzumab,49.055350553505534

Deregulation of alternative splicing (AS) may contribute to tumor progression and chemotherapy resistance. Human AS factor TRA2 has two separate gene paralogs encoding TRA2A and TRA2B proteins. TRA2B is associated with cancer cell survival and therapeutic sensitivity. However, the individual role of TRA2A in cancer progression has not been reported. Here we report that TRA2A facilitates proliferation and survival and migration and invasion of TNBC cells. In addition, TRA2A promotes paclitaxel resistance of TNBC by specifically controlling cancer-related splicing, which is independent of other splicing factors. TRA2A overexpression could promote AS of CALU, RSRC2, and PALM during paclitaxel treatment of TNBC cells. The isoform shift of RSRC2 from RSRC2s to RSRC2l leads to a decreased RSRC2 protein expression, which could contribute to TNBC paclitaxel resistance. TRA2A can regulate RSRC2 AS by specifically binding upstream intronic sequence of exon4. Strikingly, TRA2A expression is increased dramatically in patients with TNBC, and has a close relationship with decreased RSRC2 expression; both are associated with poor survival of TNBC. Collectively, our findings suggest that paclitaxel targets the TRA2A–RSRC2 splicing pathway, and deregulated TRA2A and RSRC2 expression may confer paclitaxel resistance. In addition to providing a novel molecular mechanism of cancer-related splicing dysregulation, our study demonstrates that expression of TRA2A in conjunction with RSRC2 may provide valuable molecular biomarker evidence for TNBC clinical treatment decisions and patient outcome.

TME plays a crucial role in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) immunomodulation and tumor progression, paradoxically, acting as an immunosuppressive as well as immunoreactive factor. Research regarding tumor immune microenvironment has contributed to a better understanding of TNBC subtype classification. Shall we treat patients precisely according to specific subtype classification? Moving beyond traditional chemotherapy, multiple clinical trials have recently implied the potential benefits of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy. In this review, we aimed to elucidate the paradoxical role of TME in TNBC immunomodulation, summarize the subtype classification methods for TNBC, and explore the synergistic mechanism of chemotherapy plus immunotherapy. Our study may provide a new direction for the development of combined treatment strategies for TNBC. Abstract Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease and is highly related to immunomodulation. As we know, the most effective approach to treat TNBC so far is still chemotherapy. Chemotherapy can induce immunogenic cell death, release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling; therefore, it will be interesting to investigate the relationship between chemotherapy-induced TME changes and TNBC immunomodulation. In this review, we focus on the immunosuppressive and immunoreactive role of TME in TNBC immunomodulation and the contribution of TME constituents to TNBC subtype classification. Further, we also discuss the role of chemotherapy-induced TME remodeling in modulating TNBC immune response and tumor progression with emphasis on DAMPs-associated molecules including high mobility group box1 (HMGB1), exosomes, and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1), which may provide us with new clues to explore effective combined treatment options for TNBC.",immunotherapy,48.055350553505534

Improvement of the prognosis of patients with TNBC requires identifying a predictive factor of recurrence, which would make it possible to provide beneficial personalized treatment. However, no clinically reliable predictive factor is currently known. In this study, we investigated the predictive factor of recurrence in TNBC using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-imaging mass spectrometry for lipid profiling of breast cancer specimens obtained from three and six patients with recurrent and non-recurrent TNBC, respectively. The signal for phosphatidylcholine (PC) (32:1) at m/z 732.5 was significantly higher in the recurrence group compared to the non-recurrence group (P = 0.024). PC (32:1) was more abundant in the cancer epithelial area than it was in the surrounding stroma, suggesting that abnormal lipid metabolism was associated with malignant transformation. Our results indicate PC (32:1) as a candidate predictive factor of TNBC recurrence.

This greater RBE, however, also applies to normal tissue, thereby reducing the potential advantage of high RBE. As alpha particles typically cause DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), targeting tumors that are defective in DSB repair effectively increases the RBE, yielding a secondary, RBE-based differentiation between tumor and normal tissue that is complementary to conventional, receptor-mediated tumor targeting. In some triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC; ER−/PR−/HER-2−), germline mutation in BRCA-1, a key gene in homologous recombination DSB repair, predisposes patients to early onset of breast cancer. These patients have few treatment options once the cancer has metastasized. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of alpha-particle emitter, 213Bi-labeled anti-EGF receptor antibody, cetuximab, in BRCA-1–defective TNBC. 213Bi-cetuximab was found to be significantly more effective in the BRCA-1–mutated TNBC cell line HCC1937 than BRCA-1–competent TNBC cell MDA-MB-231. siRNA knockdown of BRCA-1 or DNA-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), a key gene in non–homologous end-joining DSB repair pathway, also sensitized TNBC cells to 213Bi-cetuximab. Furthermore, the small-molecule inhibitor of DNA-PKcs, NU7441, sensitized BRCA-1–competent TNBC cells to alpha-particle radiation. Immunofluorescent staining of γ-H2AX foci and comet assay confirmed that enhanced RBE is caused by impaired DSB repair. These data offer a novel strategy for enhancing conventional receptor-mediated targeting with an additional, potentially synergistic radiobiological targeting that could be applied to TNBC.

In particular, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subset of very aggressive breast tumors, is associated with a poor prognosis and has very few efficient therapeutic options. The ectonucleotidase CD73 has recently emerged as a promising new target for TNBC in preclinical models. Pharmacological targeting of CD73 and downstream adenosine A2A/A2B receptor signaling is currently an active field of research that could lead to the development of new cancer therapeutics, including options against TNBC. Areas covered: This article reviews the basic structural and molecular features of CD73 and its role in the development of cancer, with a particular focus on CD73's role in the biology of TNBC. Expert opinion: It was recently demonstrated that CD73 expression in TNBC is associated with worse clinical outcomes and increased resistance to anthracycline chemotherapy. Targeted blockade of the CD73/A2A axis has been shown to impair various aspects of tumorigenesis and displays synergism with other anti-cancer treatments in preclinical studies. Hence, we strongly argue for the development of CD73 inhibitors and for the repositioning of A2A antagonists in cancer.",CD73,47.555350553505534

A known contributor to chemoresistance is dysfunctional mitochondrial apoptosis signaling. We set up a phenotypic small-molecule screen to reveal vulnerabilities in TNBC cells that were independent of mitochondrial apoptosis. Using a functional genetic approach, we identified that a “hit” compound, BAS-2, had a potentially similar mechanism of action to histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDAC). An in vitro HDAC inhibitor assay confirmed that the compound selectively inhibited HDAC6. Using state-of-the-art acetylome mass spectrometry, we identified glycolytic substrates of HDAC6 in TNBC cells. We confirmed that inhibition or knockout of HDAC6 reduced glycolytic metabolism both in vitro and in vivo.

Evidence from experimental and clinical studies indicates that progesterone is a risk factor for breast cancer under certain conditions through binding nuclear progesterone receptor (PR).

In this study, we demonstrate that membrane progesterone receptor α (mPRα) is expressed in TNBC tissues and the expression level of mPRα is negatively associated with the TNM stage. We found that progesterone suppressed the growth, migration and invasion of mPRα+ human TNBC cells in vitro, which was neither mediated by PR nor by PR membrane component 1 (PGRMCl). Notably, these effects exerted by progesterone were significantly blocked by shRNA specific to mPRα. Moreover, the knockdown of mPRα expression impaired the inhibitory effects of progesterone on mPRα+ tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. These data collectively indicate that progesterone suppresses TNCB growth and metastasis via mPRα, which provides evidence of the anti-neoplastic effects of progesterone-mPRα pathway in the treatment of human TNBC.",progesterone,47.055350553505534

Emerging evidence has indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play pivotal roles in the development and progression of multiple cancers. Although there are substantial studies revealing that lung cancer-associated transcript 1 (LUCAT1) functions as a tumor promotor in various human cancers, the molecular mechanism of LUCAT1 in TNBC remains largely to be explored. In our study, we identified that LUCAT1 expression was dramatically enhanced in TNBC samples and cells. High LUCAT1 expression was strongly associated with advanced stages and poor prognosis of TNBC. LUCAT1 contributed to TNBC development through accelerating cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and metastasis as well as attenuating cell apoptosis. Moreover, miR-5702 was proved to directly bind to LUCAT1 and be negatively modulated by LUCAT1. Knockdown of miR-5702 reversed the suppressing influences of LUCAT1 depletion on TNBC progression. In conclusion, it was the first investigation to shed light on the significant function and underlying regulatory mechanism of LUCAT1 in TNBC tumorigenesis.

TNBC accounts for approximately 12 to 20 percent of all breast cancer cases. The absence of ER, PR, and HER2 receptors on TNBCs and its ability to develop drug resistance renders it difficult to eradicate or retrogress tumor growth with hormonal therapy and chemotherapy. Triple-negative breast cancer is associated with poorer prognosis, increased chance of relapse, and lower chance of survival. Patients with TNBC have poorer outcome to conventional treatments than patients with other types of breast cancer. Natural killer cell-mediated immunotherapy is a promising therapeutic option for patients with TNBC. Natural killer cells contribute to the immune system by recognizing tumor cells through interactions between ligands on tumor cells and natural killer cell receptors. NK cell function is regulated by a net balance of signals from activating and inhibitory receptors interacting with ligands on target cells. Lectin-like Transcript-1 (LLT1, CLEC2D, OCIL) is a ligand that interacts with NK cell receptor NKRP1A (CD161) and inhibits NK cell activation. In this study, we have identified expression of LLT1 on TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 through flow cytometry, western blot, and confocal microscopy. We have demonstrated that blocking LLT1 on TNBCs with antibodies disrupts interaction with NKRP1A and enhances lysis of TNBCs by primary natural killer cells. We have also shown that a gene knockdown of LLT1 decreases cell surface expression of LLT1 on TNBCs and increases NK cell-mediated lysis of these TNBCs. The results suggest that LLT1 on TNBCs function as a method of evasion from immunosurveillance by NK cells. Blocking LLT1-NKRP1A interaction activates lysis by NK cells and will potentially open a new immunotherapeutic strategy for treatment of TNBC.",LLT1,46.555350553505534

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play critical roles in tumorigenesis. In the present study, we aimed to explore the potential regulatory mechanism of circRNA_069718 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
CircRNA_069718 expression levels in TNBC tissues and cell lines were determined by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). In vitro function assays were used to determine the functional roles of circRNA_069718 in TNBC and were explored by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation assay, transwell assay, and flow cytometric analysis. QRT-PCR and Western blot were used to explore the effects of circRNA_0023642 on the expression of Wnt/β-catenin pathway-related genes.


RESULTS
We found that circRNA_069718 expression was significantly increased in TNBC tissues and cell lines. High circRNA_069718 expression was significantly correlated with advanced TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor overall survival of TNBC patients. Functionally, we showed that circRNA_069718 inhibition significantly reduced TNBC cells proliferation and invasion ability in vitro. Mechanically, we found that circRNA_069718 inhibition reduced the expression levels of Wnt/β-catenin pathway-related genes (β-catenin, c-myc, and cyclin D1).


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggested that circRNA_069718 promoted TNBC progression via Wnt/β-catenin pathway and could serve as a novel therapeutic target for TNBC treatment.",circRNA_069718,46.055350553505534

Dex functions by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to prevent allergic reactions and severe chemotherapeutic side effects such as nausea and vomiting. However, the mechanisms by which Dex causes chemoresistance remain unknown. Methods We used docetaxel and cisplatin to treat triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells with or without Dex and assessed cell proliferation using a sulforhodamine B colorimetric (SRB) assay. Additionally, Western blotting was employed to measure Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), GR and several apoptosis-related proteins. To determine how the GR regulates KLF5, we used qRT-PCR, luciferase reporter assays and ChIP assays. Finally, we detected the involvement of Dex in TNBC chemotherapeutic resistance using HCC1806 xenograft model in vivo. Results In this study, we demonstrated that Dex induces docetaxel and cisplatin resistance in TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo. Dex up-regulates pro-survival transcription factor KLF5 expression at both mRNA and protein levels dependent on GR. Importantly, Dex failed to promote cancer cell survival and tumor growth when KLF5 induction was blocked. Conclusions We conclude that KLF5 is a Dex-induced gene that contributes to Dex-mediated drug chemoresistance, providing a potential novel target for TNBC treatment.",dexamethasone,45.555350553505534

Theoretically, PARP inhibitors (PARPi) eliminate tumor cells by disrupting DNA damage repair through either PARylation or the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. However, resistance to PARPi greatly hinders therapeutic effectiveness in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Owing to the high heterogeneity and few genetic targets in TNBC, there has been limited therapeutic progress in the past decades. In view of this, there is a need to circumvent resistance to PARPi and develop potential treatment strategies for TNBC. We present, herein, a review of the scientific progress and explore the mechanisms underlying PARPi resistance in TNBC. The complicated mechanisms of PARPi resistance, including drug exporter formation, loss of poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), HR reactivation, and restoration of replication fork stability, are discussed in detail in this review.

Recently, miRNA expression patterns have been identified as potential biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and personalized therapy. Here, we investigate a combination of candidate miRNAs as a clinically applicable signature that can precisely predict relapse in TNBC patients after surgery. Methods: Four total cohorts of training (TCGA_TNBC and GEOD-40525) and validation (GSE40049 and GSE19783) datasets were analyzed with logistic regression and Gaussian mixture analyses. We established a miRNA signature risk model and identified an 8-miRNA signature for the prediction of TNBC relapse. Results: The miRNA signature risk model identified ten candidate miRNAs in the training set. By combining 8 of the 10 miRNAs (miR-139-5p, miR-10b-5p, miR-486-5p, miR-455-3p, miR-107, miR-146b-5p, miR-324-5p and miR-20a-5p), an accurate predictive model of relapse in TNBC patients was established and was highly correlated with prognosis (AUC of 0.80). Subsequently, this 8-miRNA signature prognosticated relapse in the two validation sets with AUCs of 0.89 and 0.90.

We developed patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from residual tumors to identify efficient chemotherapies and predictive biomarkers in a context of resistance to anthracyclines- and taxanes-based treatments. Experimental Design: PDX were established from residual tumors of primary breast cancer patients treated in neoadjuvant setting. TNBC PDX were treated by anthracyclines, taxanes, platins, and capecitabine. Predictive biomarkers were identified by transcriptomic and immunohistologic analysis. Downregulation of RB1 was performed by siRNA in a cell line established from a PDX. Results: Residual TNBC PDX were characterized by a high tumor take, a short latency, and a poor prognosis of the corresponding patients. With the exception of BRCA1/2-mutated models, residual PDX were resistant to anthracyclines, taxanes, and platins. Capecitabine, the oral prodrug of 5-FU, was highly efficient in 60% of PDX, with two models showing complete responses. Prior treatment of a responder PDX with 5-FU increased expression of thymidylate synthase and decreased efficacy of capecitabine. Transcriptomic and IHC analyses of 32 TNBC PDX, including both residual tumors and treatment-naïve derived tumors, identified RB1 and TYMP proteins as predictive biomarkers for capecitabine response. Finally, RB1 knockdown in a cell line established from a capecitabine-responder PDX decreased sensitivity to 5-FU treatment. Conclusions: We identified capecitabine as efficient chemotherapy in TNBC PDX models established from residual disease and resistant to anthracyclines, taxanes, and platins. RB1 positivity and high expression of TYMP were significantly associated with capecitabine response. Clin Cancer Res; 24(11); 2605–15. ©2018 AACR.",capecitabine,45.555350553505534

There is a vital need for effective targeted therapeutics for TNBC patients, yet treatment strategies are challenged by the significant intertumoral heterogeneity within the TNBC subtype and its surrounding microenvironment. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) are highly expressed in several TNBC subtypes and are promising therapeutic targets. In this study, we targeted the MET receptor, which is highly expressed across several TNBC subtypes. Experimental Design: Using the small-molecule inhibitor cabozantinib (XL184), we examined the efficacy of MET inhibition in preclinical models that recapitulate human TNBC and its microenvironment. To analyze the dynamic interactions between TNBC cells and fibroblasts over time, we utilized a 3D model referred to as MAME (Mammary Architecture and Microenvironment Engineering) with quantitative image analysis. To investigate cabozantinib inhibition in vivo, we used a novel xenograft model that expresses human HGF and supports paracrine MET signaling. Results: XL184 treatment of MAME cultures of MDA-MB-231 and HCC70 cells (± HGF-expressing fibroblasts) was cytotoxic and significantly reduced multicellular invasive outgrowths, even in cultures with HGF-expressing fibroblasts. Treatment with XL184 had no significant effects on METneg breast cancer cell growth. In vivo assays demonstrated that cabozantinib treatment significantly inhibited TNBC growth and metastasis. Conclusions: Using preclinical TNBC models that recapitulate the breast tumor microenvironment, we demonstrate that cabozantinib inhibition is an effective therapeutic strategy in several TNBC subtypes.

However, ever-mounting research demonstrates striking differences between cell lines and clinical TNBC tumors, disconnecting bench research and actual clinical responses. In this review, we discuss the limitations of cell lines and the importance of using patients’ tumors for translational research, and highlight the usage of patient-derived xenograft (PDXs) models that have emerged as a clinically relevant platform for preclinical studies. PDX tumors possess tumor heterogeneity with similar cellular, molecular, genetic and epigenetic properties akin to those found within patients’ tumors. Moreover, PDX and clinical tumors possess abnormal vasculature with higher blood vessel permeability, a feature that is not always demonstrated in in vivo cell line xenografts. Development of clinically relevant, novel drug-nanoparticles capable of accumulating in PDX tumors through the enhanced permeability and retention effect in tumor vasculature may lead to new and effective TNBC treatments.",nanoparticles,45.055350553505534

Our study demonstrated that inhibition of autophagy by 3-Methyladenine or bafilomycin A1 improved Ge’s sensitivity to MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, as evidence from stronger inhibition of cell vitality and colony formation, higher level of G0/G1 arrest and DNA damage, and these effects were verified in nude mice vivo.

In this modern era of precision medicine, several new therapeutic strategies and novel agents have been investigated in the neoadjuvant setting of TNBC, in order to individualize treatment. Areas covered This review provides a comprehensive overview of the currently available evidence regarding the activity and efficacy of platinum agents, PARP- and immune-checkpoint-inhibitors for the neoadjuvant treatment of TNBC, highlighting the available data on potential predictive biomarkers of response or resistance to such treatments. Expert opinion The genomic and immune landscape of TNBC has encouraged the exploration of drugs that interfere with the DNA repair mechanism and that modulate immune response. Overall, these drugs seem to improve the pCR rate in TNBC, despite preliminary and heterogeneous results. Taking into account the economic issues and the side effects of these drugs, it is crucial to further explore the potential predictive role of BRCA mutational status and homologous recombination deficiency score, for platinum agents and PARP-inhibitors, and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and other immune biomarkers for checkpoint inhibitors, respectively.",platinum,44.555350553505534

Many patients with TNBC relapse quickly and commonly develop metastases. There are no individualized targeted adjuvant or induction treatments for TNBC, and the current treatments are highly toxic. Development of chemoprevention methods using natural products would be beneficial to patients at risk of TNBC. To investigate the inhibitory effect of blueberries on inflammation-induced TNBC and identify the mechanism underlying modulation of inflammatory proteins by blueberries, we induced a proinflammatory microenvironment by feeding female MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice a high fat western diet (W) with 5% whole blueberry powder (BB) and studied the effect on tumor formation and metastasis. We showed that mice fed a BB diet had significantly smaller tumors, less ulceration, and significantly less metastasis to the inguinal lymph nodes than mice fed a W diet. In BB-fed mice, serum levels of specific antiinflammatory cytokines were increased and specific cytokine expression was also altered. Together, these results suggest that blueberries may inhibit TNBC and TNBC-related metastasis by reducing inflammation via specific cytokine-driven pathways and thus reduce tumor growth and metastasis.",blueberries,44.555350553505534

Here, we report disruption of metabolic reprogramming in TNBC cells by silibinin via modulation of EGFR‐MYC‐TXNIP signaling. Metabolic assays combined with LC‐MS‐based metabolomics revealed inhibition of glycolysis and other key biosynthetic pathways by silibinin, to induce metabolic catastrophe in TNBC cells. Silibinin‐induced metabolic suppression resulted in decreased cell biomass, proliferation, and stem cell properties. Mechanistically, we identify EGFR‐MYC‐TXNIP as an important regulator of TNBC metabolism and mediator of inhibitory effects of silibinin. Highlighting the clinical relevance of our observations, the analysis of METABRIC dataset revealed deregulation of EGFR‐MYC‐TXNIP axis in TNBC and association of EGFRhigh‐MYChigh‐TXNIPlow signature with aggressive glycolytic metabolism and poor disease‐specific and metastasis‐free survival. Importantly, combination treatment of silibinin or 2‐deoxyglucose (glycolysis inhibitor) with paclitaxel synergistically inhibited proliferation of TNBC cells.

Our results showed that the level of TGF-β1 mRNA expression and cell invasiveness were higher in TNBC cells than in non-TNBC cells. On the other hand, the cell motility of TNBC cells was completely suppressed by LY2109761, a novel selective TGF-β receptor type I/II (TβRI/II) dual inhibitor. In addition, FN and MMP-2 expression, which play an important role on cell motility in various cancer cells, were dose-dependently decreased by LY2109761. TGF-β1 increased FN, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in HCC1806 TNBC cells. TGF-β1-induced MMP-9 expression was decreased by both a MEK inhibitor, UO126, and a smad3 inhibitor, SIS3. Induction of FN and MMP-2 by TGF-β1 was just decreased by SIS3. Overexpression of smad3 significantly increased FN, MMP-2, and MMP-9 expression.

Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an enzyme which catalyzes the methylation of arginines on histone and non‐histone proteins, has recently emerged as a putative target for cancer therapy. Potent and specific PRMT5 inhibitors have been developed, but the therapeutic efficacy of PRMT5 targeting in TNBC has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we examine the expression of PRMT5 in a human breast cancer cohort obtained from the Institut Curie, and evaluate the therapeutic potential of pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 in TNBC. We find that PRMT5 mRNA and protein are expressed at comparable levels in TNBC, luminal breast tumors, and healthy mammary tissues. However, immunohistochemistry analyses reveal that PRMT5 is differentially localized in TNBC compared to other breast cancer subtypes and to normal breast tissues. PRMT5 is heterogeneously expressed in TNBC and high PRMT5 expression correlates with poor prognosis within this breast cancer subtype. Using the small‐molecule inhibitor EPZ015666, we show that PRMT5 inhibition impairs cell proliferation in a subset of TNBC cell lines. PRMT5 inhibition triggers apoptosis, regulates cell cycle progression and decreases mammosphere formation. Furthermore, EPZ015666 administration to a patient‐derived xenograft model of TNBC significantly deters tumor progression.

MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were infected with lentivirus-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) for 72 h to obtain EGFR-overexpressed cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468). The inhibitory effects of cetuximab on the proliferation and migration of EGFR-overexpressed MDA-MB-468 cells were enhanced following transfection with the miR-155-5p antagomir, and miR-155-5p knockdown enhanced the pro-apoptotic effect of cetuximab on EGFR-overexpressed MDA-MB-468 cells. Further, the luciferase reporter assay revealed that gasdermin E (GSDME) was the direct binding target of miR-155-5p. The combination of cetuximab with the miR-155-5p antagomir promoted pyroptosis in EGFR-overexpressed MDA-MB-468 cells via the upregulation of GSDME-N and cleaved caspase-1. Results from the in vivo experiments confirmed that the downregulation of miR-155-5p enhanced the anti-tumor effect of cetuximab in an MDA-MB-468 xenograft model and on EGFR-overexpressed TNBC cells via inducing cell apoptosis and pyroptosis.

In this study, we developed a hyaluronic acid (HA)-decorated polyethylenimine-poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PEI-PLGA) nanoparticle (NP) system for targeted co-delivery of TRAIL plasmid (pTRAIL) and gambogic acid (GA) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) therapy. GA was encapsulated into the core of the PEI-PLGA NPs while pTRAIL was adsorbed onto the positive NP surface via charge adsorption. The coating of HA on PEI-PLGA NPs functions as a targeting ligand by binding to CD44 receptor of TNBC cells and a shell to neutralize the excess positive charge of inner NPs. The resultant pTRAIL and GA co-loaded HA-coated PEI-PLGA NPs exhibited spherical shape (121.5 nm) and could promote the internalization of loaded cargoes into TNBC cells through the CD44-dependent endocytic pathway. The dual drug-loaded NPs significantly augmented apoptotic cell death in vitro and inhibited TNBC tumor growth in vivo.

Cancer cells induce activation of normal fibroblasts to carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which promote survival, proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance of cancer cells. A better understanding of these interactions could lead to new, targeted therapies for cancers with limited treatment options, such as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). To overcome limitations of standard monolayer cell cultures and xenograft models that lack tumor complexity and/or human stroma, we have developed a high throughput tumor spheroid technology utilizing a polymeric aqueous two-phase system to conveniently model interactions of CAFs and TNBC cells and quantify effects on signaling and drug resistance of cancer cells. We focused on signaling by chemokine CXCL12, a hallmark molecule secreted by CAFs, and receptor CXCR4, a driver of tumor progression and metastasis in TNBC. Using three-dimensional stromal-TNBC cells cultures, we demonstrate that CXCL12 – CXCR4 signaling significantly increases growth of TNBC cells and drug resistance through activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Despite resistance to standard chemotherapy, upregulation of MAPK and PI3K signaling sensitizes TNBC cells in co-culture spheroids to specific inhibitors of these kinase pathways. Furthermore, disrupting CXCL12 – CXCR4 signaling diminishes drug resistance of TNBC cells in co-culture spheroid models. This work illustrates the capability to identify mechanisms of drug resistance and overcome them using our engineered model of tumor-stromal interactions.",CXCL12,44.055350553505534

The results showed that IL‐6 treatment could induce upregulation of HIF‐1α via the activation of STAT3 in MDA‐MB‐231 cells, which consequently contributed to its effect against chemotherapeutic drug‐induced cytotoxicity and cell apoptosis.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease with subtypes having different ""targetable"" molecular aberrations. Metaplastic breast cancers (MpBCs) are typically TNBCs and commonly have alterations in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. We previously reported efficacy for an mTOR-based chemotherapy regimen in MpBC. To determine if tumor subtype influences prognosis, we compared treatment outcomes of patients with MpBC with those of patients with nonmetaplastic TNBC receiving an mTOR-based systemic therapy regimen.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients with advanced MpBC and nonmetaplastic TNBC were treated at our institution from April 16, 2009, through November 4, 2014, using mTOR inhibition (temsirolimus or everolimus) with liposomal doxorubicin and bevacizumab (DAT/DAE). Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate associations between tumor histology and outcomes. Multivariable models were adjusted for all covariates.


RESULTS
Fourteen patients with nonmetaplastic TNBC and 59 patients with advanced MpBC were treated with DAT/DAE. MpBC patients were older (p = .002) and less likely to have a history of bevacizumab use (p = .023). Median PFS for the nonmetaplastic TNBC and MpBC patients was 2.5 months and 4.8 months, respectively. This difference in PFS was statistically significant on univariable (p = .006) but not multivariable analysis (p = .087). Median OS for the nonmetaplastic TNBC and MpBC patients was 3.7 months and 10.0 months, respectively (p = .0003). MpBC remained significantly associated with improved OS on multivariable analysis (p < .0001).


CONCLUSION
In our study, DAT/DAE appeared to be more effective in MpBC compared with nonmetaplastic TNBC. These data support patient selection for targeted therapy in TNBC.


IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE
Metaplastic breast cancers (MpBCs) represent <1% of all breast cancers, demonstrate mesenchymal differentiation, and are typically resistant to chemotherapy. Patients with advanced MpBC treated with an mTOR-based systemic therapy regimen had better long-term outcomes compared with patients with nonmetaplastic triple-negative breast cancer treated with the same regimen, suggesting that metaplastic histology may predict benefit from agents targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.",temsirolimus,43.555350553505534

Although breast cancer is traditionally considered a ‘cold’ tumor type, TNBC is the most appropriate subtype for immunotherapeutic strategies; this is due to the high level of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, PD-L1 expression, and tumor mutational burden compared to other breast cancer subtypes. Areas covered This review examines the available evidence on the use of immunotherapeutic strategies in early and advanced TNBC, discusses the pitfalls and limitations often encountered in clinical research, and summarizes data on novel promising immunomodulatory approaches that have been explored in early-phase trials. Expert opinion PD-1-blockade is approved for stage II/III TNBC and for first-line treatment of PD-L1-positive TNBC patients with metastatic disease and should be considered standard of care. However, question marks and difficulties remain; these include the identification of predictive biomarkers to select patients who benefit from the addition of PD1-blockade and the balance between efficacy and long-term toxicity for an individual patient. Numerous treatment combinations and new immunotherapeutic strategies beyond PD1 blockade are being evaluated, thus reflecting a promising evolution towards a more personalized approach, and extended clinical benefit in TNBC.

PIK3CA is an oncogene that encodes the p110α subunit of class IA PI3K to regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis. Some reports have observed neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) to have poor pathological complete response (pCR) rates in TNBC with PIK3CA mutation. This study aimed to explore the mechanism of how mutant PIK3CA alters chemotherapeutic susceptibility in TNBC. Methods TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) with PIK3CA gene mutations (E545K and H1047R regions) and overexpression were established by transfection. NOD/SCID mice were used for in vivo experiments. Epirubicin was used as the chemotherapeutic agent. Cell viability, cell cycle, apoptosis, and Transwell assays were conducted for phenotype analysis. Western blot, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect gene and protein expression levels. A clinical analysis of 50 patients with TNBC was also performed. Results Cell viability and Transwell assays showed that PIK3CA mutation promoted TNBC cell growth and conferred an enhanced migratory phenotype. Cell cycle and apoptosis assays showed that PIK3CA mutation moderately improved the proliferation ability of TNBC cells and remarkably inhibited their apoptosis. After epirubicin therapy, the proportion of early apoptotic cells decreased among cells with PIK3CA mutation. Further, xenograft tumors grew faster in NOD/SCID mice injected with mutated cell lines than in control group, suggesting that PIK3CA mutation caused chemotherapy resistance. Importantly, western blot and immunohistochemical analysis showed that cells and mouse tumors in the PIK3CA mutation groups exhibited different expression levels of apoptosis-related markers (Xiap, Bcl-2, and Caspase 3) and proteins associated with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (p110α, AKT, p-AKT, mTOR, p-mTOR, p-4E-BP1, p-p70S6K, and Pten). Moreover, prognostic analysis of 50 patients with TNBC indicated that PIK3CA mutation might be linked with relapse and death.

Due to lack of identified targets and molecular heterogeneity, conventional chemotherapy is the only available option for treatment of TNBC, but non-discordant positive therapeutic efficacy could not be achieved. Here, we demonstrated that these TNBC cells were sensitive to teriflunomide, which was a well-known immunomodulatory drug for treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). Potent anti-cancer effects in TNBC in vitro, including proliferation inhibition, cell cycle delay, cell apoptosis, and suppression of cell motility and invasiveness, could be achieved with this agent. Of note, we showed that multiple signals involved in TNBC proliferation, survival, migratory, and invasive potential were under regulation by teriflunomide. Among them, we identified down-regulation of growth factor receptors to abolish growth maintenance, suppression of c-Myc, and cyclin D1 to contribute to its anti-proliferative effect, modulation of components of cell cycle to induce S-phase arrest, degradation of Bcl-xL, and up-regulation of BAX via activation of MAPK pathway to induce apoptosis, and inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) expression, and inactivation of Src/FAK to reduce TNBC migration and invasion. The results identified teriflunomide may be of therapeutic benefit for the more aggressive and difficult-to-treat breast cancer subtype, indicating the use of teriflunomide for clinical trials for treatment of TNBC patients.",teriflunomide,43.055350553505534

However, reports suggest that higher glucose concentrations may negatively impact the anti-cancer efficacy of metformin. Therefore, we examined the anti-cancer potential of metformin in triple-negative breast cancer cells (TNBCs) exposed to different glucose (25 mM, 5.5 mM and zero glucose/glucose-starved) conditions. Our data indicates that a high glucose (25 mM) concentration (mimicking diabetes) significantly abrogated the effect of metformin on cell proliferation, cell death and cell cycle arrest in addition to loss of efficacy in inhibition of the mTOR pathway, a key metabolic pathway in TNBC cells. The mTOR pathway is activated in TNBCs compared to other subtypes of breast cancer, regulates the synthesis of proteins that are critical for the growth and survival of cancer cells and its activation is correlated to poor outcomes among TNBC patients, while also contributing to metastatic progression and development of resistance to chemotherapy/radiotherapy. Our studies were performed in two different types of TNBCs, MDA-MB-231 cells (mesenchymal stem cell-like (MSL)) and MDA-MB-468 (basal like-1 (BL-1)). Interestingly, lower concentrations of metformin (50, 100, 250, and 500 μM) significantly increased cell proliferation in 25 mM glucose exposed MDA-MB-231 cells, an effect which was not observed in MDA-MB-468 cells, indicating that the effective concentration of metformin when used as anti-cancer drug in TNBCs may have to be determined based on cell type and blood glucose concentration. Our data indicates that metformin treatment was most effective under zero glucose/glucose-starved conditions in MDA-MB-468 with a significant increase in the apoptotic population (62.3 ± 1.5%; p-value < 0.01). Under 5.5 mM glucose conditions in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells our data showed reduced viability of 73.56 ± 2.53%; p-value < 0.05 and 70.49 ± 1.68%; p-value < 0.001, respectively, along with a significant increase in apoptotic populations of both cell types.

TNBC (Triple-negative breast cancer) has limited treatment options and still lacks viable molecular targets, leading to poor outcomes. Recently, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have been shown to play crucial roles in human cancers, including BC, by modulating a number of oncogenic phenotypes. This suggests that RBPs represent potential molecular targets for BC therapy. Methods: We employed genomic data to identify RBPs specifically expressed in TNBC. NONO was silenced in TNBC cell lines to examine cell growth, colony formation, invasion, and migration. Gene expression profiles in NONO-silenced cells were generated and analyzed. A high-throughput screening for NONO-targeted drugs was performed using an FDA-approved library. Results: We found that the NONO RBP is highly expressed in TNBC and is associated with poor patient outcomes. NONO binds to STAT3 mRNA, increasing STAT3 mRNA levels in TNBC. Surprisingly, NONO directly interacts with STAT3 protein increasing its stability and transcriptional activity, thus contributing to its oncogenic function. Importantly, high-throughput drug screening revealed that auranofin is a potential NONO inhibitor and inhibits cell growth in TNBC. Conclusions: NONO is an RBP upstream regulator of both STAT3 RNA and protein levels and function. It represents an important and clinically relevant promoter of growth and resistance of TNBCs. NONO is also therefore a potential therapeutic target in TNBC.",auranofin,42.555350553505534

Using a Cancer Landscapes-based analysis, a gene regulatory network model was constructed. The present results demonstrated that FOXM1 occupies a key position in gene networks and is a critical regulatory gene in breast cancer. Using breast carcinoma gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, it was identified that FOXM1 expression was increased in the basal-like breast cancer subtype compared with other breast cancer subtypes. RNA-sequencing analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 4 and 10 µl/ml Thiostrepton identified 662 and 5,888 significantly differentially expressed genes, respectively. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses demonstrated that FOXM1 was highly associated with multiple biological processes and was markedly associated with metabolic pathways in TNBC. The use of Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins provided a critical assessment and integration of protein-protein interactions, and demonstrated the multiple important functions of FOXM1 in TNBC. Real-time cell analysis, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence staining were used to assess the anti-tumor activity of Thiostrepton in TNBC cells in vitro. The present results identified that suppression of FOXM1 using Thiostrepton inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation and the expression of cell cycle-associated genes, including cyclin A2, cyclin B2, checkpoint kinase 1, centrosomal protein 55 and polo like kinase 1. Immunofluorescence staining analysis demonstrated that vimentin, filamentous actin and zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 were all decreased following treatment with Thiostrepton. Furthermore, a BALB/C nude mouse subcutaneous xenograft model was used to verify the function of FOXM1 in vivo. The present results demonstrated that FOXM1 inhibition significantly suppressed MDA-MB-231 cell tumorigenesis in vivo. Overall, the present results suggested that FOXM1 is a key gene that serves important roles in multiple biological processes in TNBC and that it may serve as a novel therapeutic target in TNBC.",Thiostrepton,42.555350553505534

G47Δ-mIL12 efficiently infected and killed murine (4T1 and EMT6) and human (HCC1806 and MDA-MB-468) mammary tumor cells in vitro. In vivo in the 4T1 syngeneic TNBC model, it significantly reduced primary tumor burden and metastasis, both at early and late stages of tumor development. The virus-induced local and abscopal effects were confirmed by significantly increased infiltration of CD45+ leukocytes and CD8+ T cells, and reduction of granulocytic and monocytic MDSCs in tumors, both treated and untreated contralateral, and in the spleen. Significant trafficking of dendritic cells (DCs) were only observed in spleens of virus-treatment group, indicating that DCs are primed and activated in the tumor-microenvironment following virotherapy, and trafficked to lymphoid organs for activation of immune cells, such as CD8+ T cells. DC priming/activation could be associated with virally enhanced expression of several antigen processing/presentation genes in the tumor microenvironment, as confirmed by NanoString gene expression analysis. Besides DC activation/priming, G47Δ-mIL12 treatment led to up-regulation of CD8+ T cell activation markers in the tumor microenvironment and inhibition of tumor angiogenesis.

Patients expressing the estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER and PR) and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER-2) tumor markers have favorable prognosis and efficacious therapeutic options. In contrast, tumors that are negative for these markers (triple-negative) have a disproportionate share of morbidity and mortality due to lack of a validated molecular target. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are a critical component of ubiquitin-proteasome-system degradation and have been shown to be differentially expressed and activated in a number of cancers, including breast, with their aberrant activity linked to cancer prognosis and clinical outcome. We evaluated the effect of the DUB inhibitors b-AP15 and RA-9 alone and in combination with early- and late-stage lysosomal inhibitors on cell viability in a panel of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines. Our results indicate small-molecule DUB inhibitors have a profound effect on TNBC viability and lead to activation of autophagy as a cellular mechanism to compensate for ubiquitin-proteasome-system stress. Treatment with sub-optimal doses of DUB and lysosome inhibitors synergistically kills TNBC cells. This supports the evaluation of DUB inhibition, in combination with lysosomal inhibition, as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of TNBC.",b-AP15,42.055350553505534

Surgery is always not available due to the dissemination of metastatic foci and most drugs are powerless because of poor retention at metastatic sites. TNBC cells generate an inflamed microenvironment and overexpress adhesive molecules to promote invasion and colonization. Herein, “walking dead” TNBC cells are developed through conjugating anti‐PD‐1 (programmed death protein 1 inhibitor) and doxorubicin (DOX)‐loaded liposomes onto cell corpses for temporal chemo‐immunotherapy against lung metastasis. The walking dead TNBC cells maintain plenary tumor antigens to conduct vaccination effects. Anti‐PD‐1 antibodies are conjugated to cell corpses via reduction‐activated linker, and DOX‐loaded liposomes are attached by maleimide–thiol coupling. This anchor strategy enables rapid release of anti‐PD‐1 upon reduction conditions while long‐lasting release of DOX at inflamed metastatic sites. The walking dead TNBC cells improve pulmonary accumulation and local retention of drugs, reprogram the lung microenvironment through damage‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and PD‐1 blockade, and prolong overall survival of lung metastatic 4T1 and EMT6‐bearing mice. Taking advantage of the walking dead TNBC cells for pulmonary preferred delivery of chemotherapeutics and checkpoint inhibitors, this study suggests an alternative treatment option of chemo‐immunotherapy to augment the efficacy against lung metastasis.",doxorubicin,41.555350553505534

Hence, TNBC patients cannot benefit from clinically available targeted therapies and rely on chemotherapy and surgery for treatment. While initially responding to chemotherapy, TNBC patients are at increased risk of developing distant metastasis and have decreased overall survival compared with non-TNBC patients. A majority of TNBC tumors carry p53 mutations, enabling them to bypass the G1 checkpoint and complete the cell cycle even in the presence of DNA damage. Therefore, we hypothesized that TNBC cells are sensitive to cell-cycle–targeted combination therapy, which leaves nontransformed cells unharmed. Our findings demonstrate that sequential administration of the pan-CDK inhibitor roscovitine before doxorubicin treatment is synthetically lethal explicitly in TNBC cells. Roscovitine treatment arrests TNBC cells in the G2–M cell-cycle phase, priming them for DNA damage. Combination treatment increased frequency of DNA double-strand breaks, while simultaneously reducing recruitment of homologous recombination proteins compared with doxorubicin treatment alone. Furthermore, this combination therapy significantly reduced tumor volume and increased overall survival compared with single drug or concomitant treatment in xenograft studies. Examination of isogenic immortalized human mammary epithelial cells and isogenic tumor cell lines found that abolishment of the p53 pathway is required for combination-induced cytotoxicity, making p53 a putative predictor of response to therapy. By exploiting the specific biologic and molecular characteristics of TNBC tumors, this innovative therapy can greatly impact the treatment and care of TNBC patients.

Thus, TNBC patients cannot benefit from hormone receptor-targeted therapy as non-TNBC patients, but can only receive chemotherapy as the systemic treatment and have a worse overall outcome. More effective therapeutic targets and combination therapy strategies are urgently needed to improve the treatment effectiveness. Methods: We analyzed the expression levels of EZH2 and TET1 in TCGA and our own breast cancer patient cohort, and tested their correlation with patient survival. We used TNBC and non-TNBC cell lines and mouse xenograft tumor model to unveil novel EZH2 targets and investigated the effect of EZH2 inhibition or TET1 overexpression in cell proliferation and viability of TNBC cells. Results: In TNBC cells, EZH2 decreases TET1 expression by H3K27me3 epigenetic regulation and subsequently suppresses anti-tumor p53 signaling pathway. Patients with high EZH2 and low TET1 presented the poorest survival outcome. Experimentally, targeting EZH2 in TNBC cells with specific inhibitor GSK343 or shRNA genetic approach could induce cell cycle arrest and senescence by elevating TET1 expression and p53 pathway activation. Using mouse xenograft model, we have tested a novel therapy strategy to combine GSK343 and chemotherapy drug Adriamycin and could show drastic and robust inhibition of TNBC tumor growth by synergistic induction of senescence and apoptosis. Conclusions: We postulate that the well-controlled dynamic pathway EZH2-H3K27me3-TET1 is a novel epigenetic co-regulator module and provide evidence regarding how to exploit it as a novel therapeutic target via its pivotal role in senescence and apoptosis control. Of clinical and therapeutic significance, the present study opens a new avenue for TNBC treatment by targeting the EZH2-H3K27me3-TET1 pathway that can modulate the epigenetic landscape.",GSK343,41.055350553505534

Particularly breast cancers, which do not express estrogen receptor α (ERα) and progesterone receptor (PR) and which have no overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), so-called triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), are considered as very aggressive and have a poor prognosis. Recently we have shown that breast cancer cell invasion was dramatically increased when co-cultured with MG63 osteoblast-like cells. Using this model we have now analyzed whether estrogen receptor β (ERβ) plays a role in TNBC cell invasion in vitro. ERα and ERβ protein expression was analyzed using western blot analysis. Invasion was quantified by assessment of TNBC cell migration rate through an artificial basement membrane in a modified Boyden chamber during co-culture with MG63 osteoblast-like cells. The effects of ERβ agonist treatment on CXC motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) protein expression during co-culture with MG64 cells was quantified using western blot analysis. Proliferation was measured using alamarBlue assay. TNBC cell lines HCC1806 and HCC1937 showed no ERα but high ERβ protein expression. Cell invasion of HCC1806 and HCC1937 TNBC cells was significantly increased when co-cultured with MG63 osteoblast-like cells. Treatment with ERβ selective estrogen agonists liquiritigenin and ERB-041 reduced the ability to invade a reconstituted basement membrane and to migrate in response to the cellular stimulus. During co-culture CXCR4 protein expression of TNBC cell lines HCC1806 and HCC1937 was significantly increased. Treatment with liquiritigenin resulted in a significant decrease of CXCR4 protein expression. Both ERβ agonists showed no effect on TNBC cell proliferation. Our findings suggest that ERβ plays a major role in TNBC invasion. Bone-directed invasion can be inhibited by ERβ agonists.",liquiritigenin,41.055350553505534

However, the molecular regulation of MTDH is still not completely understood. In this study we document that AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation‐induced anti‐proliferative effects are, in part, mediated by inhibiting MTDH expression in MDA‐MB‐231 and BT‐549 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. 5‐Aminoimidazole‐4‐carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), an AMPK activator, caused growth arrest, inhibition of migration and invasion of TNBC cells. Intriguingly, AICAR or metformin treatment resulted in significant downregulation of MTDH expression via inhibiting c‐Myc expression. In contrast, treatment of cells with compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK, increased both c‐Myc and MTDH expressions in TNBC cells. Also, AMPK activation caused increased glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) activity by inhibiting the inactive phosphorylation at Ser9, on the one hand, and activation of sirtuin1 (SIRT1) by inhibiting Ser47 phosphorylation, as evidenced by deacetylation of p53, on the other hand. Moreover, AMPK‐induced GSK3β and SIRT1 activities were found to be responsible for inhibiting c‐Myc‐mediated upregulation of MTDH, as LiCl (an inhibitor of GSK3β) and EX‐527 (an inhibitor of SIRT1) reversed AICAR‐mediated downregulation of c‐Myc and MTDH expressions. Similar results were observed with siSIRT1 treatment. Furthermore, AICAR and EX‐527 treatments caused increased cell death under MTDH‐depleted conditions. Finally, we uncovered a novel regulation of MTDH expression and showed that AMPK activation by inducing GSK3β and SIRT1 downregulates MTDH expression via inhibiting c‐Myc in TNBC cells.",AICAR,41.055350553505534

One factor limiting responsiveness of TNBCs to ICIs is a lack of functional tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in ‘non-inflamed’ or ‘cold’ tumor immune microenvironments (TIMEs), although by unknown mechanisms. Targeting MUC1-C in a mouse transgenic TNBC tumor model increases cytotoxic tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells (CTLs), supporting a role for MUC1-C in immune evasion. The basis for these findings and whether they extend to human TNBCs are not known. Methods Human TNBC cells silenced for MUC1-C using short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were analyzed for the effects of MUC1-C on global transcriptional profiles. Differential expression and rank order analysis was used for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Gene expression was confirmed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR and immunoblotting. The The Cancer Genome Atlas Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA-BRCA) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) datasets were analyzed for effects of MUC1 on GSEA, cell-type enrichment, and tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion. Single-cell scRNA-seq datasets of TNBC samples were analyzed for normalized expression associations between MUC1 and selected genes within tumor cells. Results Our results demonstrate that MUC1-C is a master regulator of the TNBC transcriptome and that MUC1-C-induced gene expression is driven by STAT1 and IRF1. We found that MUC1-C activates the inflammatory interferon (IFN)-γ-driven JAK1→STAT1→IRF1 pathway and induces the IDO1 and COX2/PTGS2 effectors, which play key roles in immunosuppression. Involvement of MUC1-C in activating the immunosuppressive IFN-γ pathway was extended by analysis of human bulk and scRNA-seq datasets. We further demonstrate that MUC1 associates with the depletion and dysfunction of CD8+ T cells in the TNBC TIME. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that MUC1-C integrates activation of the immunosuppressive IFN-γ pathway with depletion of TILs in the TNBC TIME and provide support for MUC1-C as a potential target for improving TNBC treatment alone and in combination with ICIs. Of translational significance, MUC1-C is a druggable target with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and a functional inhibitor that are under clinical development.",MUC1-C,41.055350553505534

First, by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blotting (WB), increased SK4 protein expression in breast tumor tissues was detected relative to that in non-tumor breast tissues, but there was no apparent expression difference between various subtypes of breast cancer (p>0.05). Next, functional SK4 channels were detected in the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 using WB, real-time PCR, immunofluorescence and patch-clamp recording. By employing SK4 specific siRNAs and blockers, including TRAM-34 and clotrimazole, in combination with an MTT assay, a colony-formation assay, flow cytometry and a cell motility assay, we found that the suppression of SK4 channels significantly inhibited cell proliferation and migration and promoted apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells (p<0.05). Further investigation revealed that treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF)/basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) caused MDA-MB-231 cells to undergo the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and to show increased SK4 mRNA expression.

Cancer cells exploit the unfolded protein response (UPR) to mitigate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress caused by cellular oncogene activation and a hostile tumor microenvironment (TME). The key UPR sensor IRE1α resides in the ER and deploys a cytoplasmic kinase–endoribonuclease module to activate the transcription factor XBP1s, which facilitates ER-mediated protein folding. Studies of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)—a highly aggressive malignancy with a dismal posttreatment prognosis—implicate XBP1s in promoting tumor vascularization and progression. However, it remains unknown whether IRE1α adapts the ER in TNBC cells and modulates their TME, and whether IRE1α inhibition can enhance antiangiogenic therapy—previously found to be ineffective in patients with TNBC. To gauge IRE1α function, we defined an XBP1s-dependent gene signature, which revealed significant IRE1α pathway activation in multiple solid cancers, including TNBC. IRE1α knockout in TNBC cells markedly reversed substantial ultrastructural expansion of their ER upon growth in vivo. IRE1α disruption also led to significant remodeling of the cellular TME, increasing pericyte numbers while decreasing cancer-associated fibroblasts and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Pharmacologic IRE1α kinase inhibition strongly attenuated growth of cell line–based and patient-derived TNBC xenografts in mice and synergized with anti-VEGFA treatment to cause tumor stasis or regression. Thus, TNBC cells critically rely on IRE1α to adapt their ER to in vivo stress and to adjust the TME to facilitate malignant growth. TNBC reliance on IRE1α is an important vulnerability that can be uniquely exploited in combination with antiangiogenic therapy as a promising new biologic approach to combat this lethal disease. Significance: Pharmacologic IRE1α kinase inhibition reverses ultrastructural distension of the ER, normalizes the tumor vasculature, and remodels the cellular TME, attenuating TNBC growth in mice.",IRE1α,40.555350553505534

Genomic profiling studies highlighted the high level of heterogeneity of this cancer, which comprises different subtypes with unique phenotypes and response to treatment. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) is an established mesenchymal/stem cell-specific marker in human glioblastoma and, as recently suggested, it may uniquely mark breast cancer cells with stem-like characteristics and/or that have undergone epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Methods: Immunohistochemical analysis for PDGFRβ expression was performed on a human TNBC tissue microarray. Functional assays were conducted on mesenchymal-like TNBC cells to investigate the effect of a previously validated PDGFRβ aptamer on invasive cell growth in three-dimensional culture conditions, migration, invasion and tube formation. The aptamer was labeled with a near-infrared (NIR) dye and its binding specificity to PDGFRβ was assessed both in vitro (confocal microscopy and flow cytometry analyses) and in vivo (fluorescence molecular tomography in mice bearing TNBC xenografts). A mouse model of TNBC lung metastases formation was established and NIR-labeled PDGFRβ aptamer was used to detect lung metastases in mice untreated or intravenously injected with unlabeled aptamer. Results: Here, we present novel data showing that tumor cell expression of PDGFRβ identifies a subgroup of mesenchymal tumors with invasive and stem-like phenotype, and propose a previously unappreciated role for PDGFRβ in driving TNBC cell invasiveness and metastases formation. We show that the PDGFRβ aptamer blocked invasive growth and migration/invasion of mesenchymal TNBC cell lines and prevented TNBC lung metastases formation. Further, upon NIR-labeling, the aptamer specifically bound to TNBC xenografts and detected lung metastases. Conclusions: We propose PDGFRβ as a reliable biomarker of a subgroup of mesenchymal TNBCs with invasive and stem-like phenotype as well as the use of the PDGFRβ aptamer as a high efficacious tool for imaging and suppression of TNBC lung metastases. This study will allow for the significant expansion of the current repertoire of strategies for managing patients with more aggressive TNBC.",PDGFRβ,39.555350553505534

Therefore, our aim was to investigate the targeting of AR as a possible hormonal approach to the treatment of TNBC. Analysis of 2091 patients revealed an association between AR expression and poor overall survival, selectively in patients with the basal subtype of breast cancer, the vast majority of which are TNBC. IC50 values for the second-generation anti-androgen enzalutamide across 11 breast cancer cell lines varied from 4 µM to >50 µM. The activity of enzalutamide was similar in TN and non-TN cell lines but was dependent on the presence of AR. Enzalutamide reduced clonogenic potential and cell growth in a 3D matrix in AR-positive cells. In addition, enzalutamide also inhibited cell migration and invasion in an AR-dependent manner. Enzalutamide appeared to mediate these processes through down-regulation of the transcription factors AP-1 and SP-1. The first-generation anti-androgen flutamide similarly blocked cell growth, migration and invasion. AR-positive TNBC cells clustered separately from AR-negative cells based on an androgen-related gene expression signature, independently of TNBC subtype. We conclude that targeting of the AR with drugs such as enzalutamide may provide an alternative treatment strategy for patients with AR-positive TNBC.",enzalutamide,39.555350553505534

The incidence rates of TNBC subtype are higher in African-American women, and the evidence indicates that these women have worse prognosis compared to women of European descent. The reasons for this disparity remain unclear but are often attributed to TNBC biology. In this study, we performed metabolic analysis of breast tissues to identify how TNBC differs from luminal A breast cancer (LABC) subtypes within the African-American and Caucasian breast cancer patients, respectively. We used High-Resolution Magic Angle Spinning (HR-MAS) 1H Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to perform the metabolomic analysis of breast cancer and adjacent normal tissues (total n=82 samples). TNBC and LABC subtypes in African American women exhibited different metabolic profiles. Metabolic profiles of these subtypes were also distinct from those revealed in Caucasian women. TNBC in African-American women expressed higher levels of glutathione, choline, and glutamine as well as profound metabolic alterations characterized by decreased mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolysis concomitant with decreased levels of ATP. TNBC in Caucasian women was associated with increased pyrimidine synthesis.

Here we report that protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6) is expressed in approximately 70% of TNBCs where it acts to promote survival and metastatic lung colonization. PTK6 downregulation in mesenchymal TNBC cells suppressed migration and three-dimensional culture growth, and enhanced anoikis, resistance to which is considered a prerequisite for metastasis. PTK6 downregulation restored E-cadherin levels via proteasome-dependent degradation of the E-cadherin repressor SNAIL. Beyond being functionally required in TNBC cells, kinase-active PTK6 also suppressed E-cadherin expression, promoted cell migration, and increased levels of mesenchymal markers in nontransformed MCF10A breast epithelial cells, consistent with a role in promoting an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). SNAIL downregulation and E-cadherin upregulation mediated by PTK6 inhibition induced anoikis, leading to impaired metastatic lung colonization in vivo Finally, effects of PTK6 downregulation were phenocopied by treatment with a recently developed PTK6 kinase inhibitor, further implicating kinase activity in regulation of EMT and metastases.

We investigated the value of TIL levels by evaluating lymphocyte infiltration before and after NAC. Experimental Design: We assessed stromal TIL levels in 716 pre- and posttreatment matched paired specimens, according to the guidelines of the International TIL Working Group. Results: Pre-NAC TIL levels were higher in tumors for which pCR was achieved than in cases with residual disease (33.9% vs. 20.3%, P = 0.001). This was observed in luminal tumors and TNBCs, but not in HER2-positive breast cancers (PInteraction = 0.001). The association between pre-NAC TIL levels and pCR was nonlinear in TNBCs (P = 0.005). Mean TIL levels decreased after chemotherapy completion (pre-NAC TILs: 24.1% vs. post-NAC TILs: 13.0%, P < 0.001). This decrease was strongly associated with high pCR rates, and the variation of TIL levels was strongly inversely correlated with pre-NAC TIL levels (r = −0.80, P < 0.001). Pre-NAC TILs and disease-free survival (DFS) were associated in a nonlinear manner (P < 0.001). High post-NAC TIL levels were associated with aggressive tumor characteristics and with impaired DFS in HER2-positive breast cancers (HR, 1.04; confidence interval, 1.02–1.06; P = 0.001), but not in luminal tumors or TNBCs (PInteraction = 0.04). Conclusions: The associations of pre- and post-NAC TIL levels with response to treatment and DFS differ between breast cancer subtypes. The characterization of immune subpopulations may improve our understanding of the complex interactions between pre- or post-NAC setting, breast cancer subtype, response to treatment, and prognosis.",chemotherapy,39.055350553505534

Among the novel therapies that have been approved for the clinical management of TNBC, immunotherapy shows great potential. Although exciting progress has been made in immunotherapy for TNBC, there are still gaps to fill. This review will analyze current immunotherapy strategies in TNBC, summarize the current landscape of clinical trials, review the results achieved, and shed light on future developments. Abstract Due to the absence of hormone receptor (both estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors) along with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) amplification, the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cannot benefit from endocrine or anti-HER-2 therapy. For a long time, chemotherapy was the only systemic treatment for TNBC. Due to the lack of effective treatment options, the prognosis for TNBC is extremely poor. The successful application of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) launched the era of immunotherapy in TNBC. However, the current findings show modest efficacy of programmed cell death- (ligand) 1 (PD-(L)1) inhibitors monotherapy and only a small proportion of patients can benefit from this approach. Based on the basic principles of immunotherapy and the characteristics of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in TNBC, immune combination therapy is expected to further enhance the efficacy and expand the beneficiary population of patients. Given the diversity of drugs that can be combined, it is important to select effective biomarkers to identify the target population. Moreover, the side effects associated with the combination of multiple drugs should also be considered.",immunotherapy,39.055350553505534

Epidemiologic studies demonstrate that women diagnosed with TNBC manifest a significantly different set of clinic-pathologic features and risk factors when compared to women with other subtypes of breast cancer. They are associated with poor prognosis, as defined by low five-year survival. To date many studies have examined the utility of traditional chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with TNBC and have confirmed the benefits of these agents in both the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. Targeted therapy options involving PARP1 and EGFR inhibition, are currently in different phases of development and will hopefully change the paradigm of how patients with TNBC are treated. The present commentary aims to summarize the latest findings on chemotherapy in the treatment of TNBC in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting and explore the ongoing development of newer targeted agents.",chemotherapy,39.055350553505534

However, few cases undergo FISH in China, leading to difficulty regarding subsequent treatment decisions. Here, we used immunohistochemical analysis to explore expression of fascin‐1, an actin‐bundling protein, as a diagnostic marker of TNBC. A total of 457 cases of breast cancer were divided into four molecular subtypes, including 82 cases (17.9%) of TNBC, 81 (17.7%) of HER2‐enriched, 185 (40.5%) of luminal A, and 109 (23.9%) of luminal B. Positive fascin‐1 expression was seen in 144 cases (31.5%), including 77 (16.8%) strong positive cases. Rates of positive and strong positive expression of fascin‐1 were significantly higher in cases of TNBC than in the other molecular subtypes. In all cases of breast cancer, the sensitivities and specificities of positive and strong positive fascin‐1 expression for predicting TNBC were 87.8% and 80.8%, and 78.0% and 96.5%, respectively. In cases of hormone receptor–negative breast cancer, the sensitivities and specificities of positive and strong positive fascin‐1 expression for predicting TNBC were 87.8% and 61.7%, and 78.0% and 92.6%, respectively. In 24 cases with estrogen receptor (ER)‐, PR‐, and HER2 2 + equivocal status who underwent FISH, the sensitivity and specificity of strong positive fascin‐1 expression for predicting TNBC were 71.4% and 90.0%.

Strikingly, a high percentage of TNBCs overexpresses the EGF receptor (EGFR), yet EGFR inhibition has yielded little clinical benefit. Over the last decade, advances in EGFR biology have established that EGFR functions in two distinct signaling pathways: (i) classical membrane-bound signaling and (ii) nuclear signaling. Previous studies have demonstrated that nuclear EGFR (nEGFR) can enhance resistance to anti-EGFR therapies and is correlated with poor overall survival in breast cancer. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that nEGFR may promote intrinsic resistance to cetuximab in TNBC. To examine this question, a battery of TNBC cell lines and human tumors were screened and found to express nEGFR. Knockdown of EGFR expression demonstrated that TNBC cell lines retained dependency on EGFR for proliferation, yet all cell lines were resistant to cetuximab. Furthermore, Src Family Kinases (SFKs) influenced nEGFR translocation in TNBC cell lines and in vivo tumor models, where inhibition of SFK activity led to potent reductions in nEGFR expression. Inhibition of nEGFR translocation led to a subsequent accumulation of EGFR on the plasma membrane, which greatly enhanced sensitivity of TNBC cells to cetuximab. Collectively, these data suggest that targeting both the nEGFR signaling pathway, through the inhibition of its nuclear transport, and the classical EGFR signaling pathway with cetuximab may be a viable approach for the treatment of patients with TNBC.

To date, there is no approved targeted therapy for TNBCs. Aurora kinases act as regulators of mammalian cell division. They are important for cell-cycle progression and are frequently overexpressed or mutated in human tumors, including breast cancer. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting Aurora kinases in preclinical models of human breast cancers using a pan-inhibitor of Aurora kinases, AS703569. In vitro, AS703569 was tested in 15 human breast cancer cell lines. TNBC cell lines were more sensitive to AS703569 than were other types of breast cancer cells. Inhibition of proliferation was associated with cell-cycle arrest, aneuploidy, and apoptosis. In vivo, AS703569 administered alone significantly inhibited tumor growth in seven of 11 patient-derived breast cancer xenografts. Treatment with AS703569 was associated with a decrease of phospho-histone H3 expression. Finally, AS703569 combined to doxorubicin–cyclophosphamide significantly inhibited in vivo tumor recurrence, suggesting that Aurora kinase inhibitors could be used both in monotherapy and in combination settings. In conclusion, these data indicate that targeting Aurora kinases could represent a new effective approach for TNBC treatment.

Nuclear localized class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) enzymes, particularly HDACs 1, 2, 3 deacetylate chromatin histones, are overexpressed in cancers and epigenetically regulate the expression of genes involved in cancer initiation and progression. The specific HDAC inhibitor, entinostat, has been shown to attenuate tumor progression and metastasis in TNBC. In this study, we hypothesized that entinostat would enhance the expression of anti-angiogenic and tumor suppressor genes and would thus suppress VM structures in TNBC cells in a 3D Matrigel cell culture preclinical model. Our data indicated that invasive triple-negative MDA-MB-231, LM2-4 and BT-549 breast cancer cells, but not poorly invasive luminal MCF-7 cells, efficiently underwent matrix-associated VM formation. Approximately 80% of TNBC cells with the stem cell phenotype potential formed vessel-like structures when mixed with Matrigel and cultured in the low attachment tissue culture plate. The molecular mechanisms of VM formation are rather complex, while angiogenesis inhibitor genes are downregulated and pro-angiogenesis genes are upregulated in VM-forming cells. Our data revealed that treatment of the TNBC VM phenotype cells with entinostat epigenetically led to the re-expression of the anti-angiogenic genes, serpin family F member 1 (SERPINF1) and thrombospondin 2 (THBS2), and to that of the tumor suppressor genes, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and p21, and reduced VM structures. We also found that treatment of the TNBC VM phenotype cells with entinostat downregulated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), and that of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes, Vimentin and β-catenin. METABIRC and TCGA breast cancer cohort mRNA expression data analysis revealed that a high expression of the anti-angiogenesis-associated genes, THBS2, SERPINF1 and serpin family B member 5 (SERPINB5), and of the tumor suppressor gene, PTEN, was associated with a better overall survival (OS) of breast cancer patients. Taken together, the findings of this study demonstrate that HDACs 1, 2, 3 partly contribute to VM formation in TNBC cells; thus, HDACs may be an important therapeutic target for TNBC.",entinostat,37.055350553505534

Cadherin 11 (CDH11) is overexpressed in invasive breast cancer cells and implicated in distant bone metastases in several cancers. The WNT signalling pathway regulates CSC activity. Growing evidence suggest that cadherins play critical roles in WNT signalling pathway. However, CDH11 role in canonical WNT signalling and CSCs in breast cancer is poorly understood. Methods: We investigated the functional association between CDH11 and WNT signalling pathway in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), by analyzing their expression profile in the TCGA Breast Cancer (BRCA) cohort and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of TNBC samples. Results: We observed a significant correlation between high CDH11 expression and poor prognosis in the basal and TNBC subtypes. Also, CDH11 expression positively correlated with β-catenin, wingless type MMTV integration site (WNT)2, and transcription factor (TCF)12 expression. IHC results showed CDH11 and β-catenin expression significantly correlated in TNBC patients (p < 0.05). We also showed that siRNA-mediated loss-of-CDH11 (siCDH11) function decreases β-catenin, Met, c-Myc, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)7 expression level in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578t. Interestingly, immunofluorescence staining showed that siCDH11 reduced β-catenin nuclear localization and attenuated TNBC cell migration, invasion and tumorsphere-formation. Of translational relevance, siCDH11 exhibited significant anticancer efficacy in murine tumor xenograft models, as demonstrated by reduced tumor-size, inhibited tumor growth and longer survival time. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that by modulating β-catenin, CDH11 regulates the canonical WNT signalling pathway. CDH11 inhibition suppresses the CSC-like phenotypes and tumor growth of TNBC cells and represents a novel therapeutic approach in TNBC treatment.",siCDH11,37.055350553505534

The aim was to identify a group of serological biomarkers and to identify possible candidates for targeted therapy in patients with TNBC and non-TNBC. Protein levels of TGF-β1, IGF-I/IGF-IR and VEGF-A in the serum were measured in 43 TNBC, 53 non-TNBC and 20 normal control participants using quantitative ELISA assays. Results were correlated against standard prognostic factors, response to treatment and survival. TNBC was identified to be associated with poor prognosis and serum levels of VEGF-A and IGF/IGF-IR were significantly higher in the TNBC group compared with the non-TNBC group. IGF-IR and VEGF-A overexpression was observed to be correlated with TGF-β1 expression and all of the markers investigated were associated with metastasis and disease progression. In the multivariate analysis, VEGF-A, IGF-I and IGF-IR were observed to be independent predictors for overall survival, whereas TGF-β1 and lymph node status were identified as independent predictors for disease-free survival. The overall response rate was significantly lower in patients with TNBC and those with high levels of TGF-β1, IGF-I/IGF-IR and VEGF-A. In view of the present results, it was concluded that TGF-β1, IGF-I/IGF-IR and VEGF-A overexpression is associated with the presence of aggressive tumors, which exhibit an increased probability of metastasis, a poor response to treatment and reduced survival rate.

Although targeted therapies to inhibit the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis are under clinical experimentation, still no effective therapeutic approaches have been established to block CXCR4 in TNBC. To unravel the role of the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis in the formation of TNBC early metastases, we used the zebrafish xenograft model. Importantly, we demonstrate that cross-communication between the zebrafish and human ligands and receptors takes place and human tumor cells expressing CXCR4 initiate early metastatic events by sensing zebrafish cognate ligands at the metastatic site. Taking advantage of the conserved intercommunication between human tumor cells and the zebrafish host, we blocked TNBC early metastatic events by chemical and genetic inhibition of CXCR4 signaling. We used IT1t, a potent CXCR4 antagonist, and show for the first time its promising anti-tumor effects. In conclusion, we confirm the validity of the zebrafish as a xenotransplantation model and propose a pharmacological approach to target CXCR4 in TNBC. Summary: CXCR4-expressing human tumor cells respond to zebrafish cognate ligands and initiate metastatic events in a zebrafish xenograft model. The CXCR4 antagonist IT1t has promising tumor inhibitory effects.",IT1t,36.555350553505534

Previous studies have shown that AR is widely expressed in up to one-third of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the role of AR in TNBC is still not fully understood, especially in mesenchymal stem-like (MSL) TNBC cells. Methods: MSL TNBC MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T breast cancer cells were exposed to various concentration of agonist 5-α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or nonsteroidal antagonist bicalutamide or untreated. The effects of AR on cell viability and apoptosis were determined by MTT assay, cell counting, flow cytometry analysis and protein expression of p53, p73, p21 and Cyclin D1 were analyzed by western blotting. The bindings of AR to p73 and p21 promoter were detected by ChIP assay. MDA-MB-231 cells were transplanted into nude mice and the tumor growth curves were determined and expression of AR, p73 and p21 were detected by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining after treatment of DHT or bicalutamide. Results: We demonstrate that AR agonist DHT induces MSL TNBC breast cancer cells proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in vitro. Similarly, activated AR significantly increases viability of MDA-MB-231 xenografts in vivo. On the contrary, AR antagonist, bicalutamide, causes apoptosis and exerts inhibitory effects on the growth of breast cancer. Moreover, DHT-dependent activation of AR involves regulation in the cell cycle related genes, including p73, p21 and Cyclin D1. Further investigations indicate the modulation of AR on p73 and p21 mediated by direct binding of AR to their promoters, and DHT could make these binding more effectively. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the tumorigenesis role of AR and the inhibitory effect of bicalutamide in AR-positive MSL TNBC both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that AR inhibition could be a potential therapeutic approach for AR-positive TNBC patients.",bicalutamide,36.555350553505534

Unlike hormone receptor-positive subtypes, treatment of TNBC is currently limited by the lack of clinically available targeted therapies. Androgen signaling is necessary for normal breast development, and its dysregulation has been implicated in breast tumorigenesis. In recent years, gene expression studies have identified a subset of TNBC that is enriched for androgen receptor (AR) signaling. Interference with androgen signaling in TNBC is promising, and AR-inhibiting drugs have shown antitumorigenic activity in preclinical and proof of concept clinical studies. Recent advances in our understanding of androgenic signaling in TNBC, along with the identification of interacting pathways, are allowing development of the next generation of clinical trials with AR inhibitors. As novel AR-targeting agents are developed and evaluated in clinical trials, it is equally important to establish a robust set of biomarkers for identification of TNBC tumors that are most likely to respond to AR inhibition.",androgen,36.055350553505534

Palbociclib, a cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor is approved for metastatic estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and human epithermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. The nature of cell cycle inhibition by palbociclib suggests its potential in TNBC cells. Retinoblastoma (RB, a known substrate of CDK4/6) pathway deregulation is a frequent occurrence in TNBC and studies have revealed that pharmacological CDK4/6 inhibition induces a cooperative cytostatic effect with doxorubicin in RB-proficient TNBC models. In addition, recent studies reported that anti-androgen therapy shows preclinical efficacy in androgen-receptor (AR)-positive TNBC cells. Here we examined the effect of palbociclib in combination with an anti-androgen enzalutamide in TNBC cells. Method MDA-MB-453, BT-549, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cell lines were used for in vitro studies. Protein expressions were assessed by Western blot analysis. Cytostatic effect was examined by MTT assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis were examined by flow cytometry. Results Palbociclib showed inhibitory effect in RB-proficient TNBC cells, and enzalutamide inhibited cell viability in AR-positive TNBC cells. Enzalutamide treatment could enhance the palbociclib-induced cytostatic effect in AR-positive/RB-proficient TNBC cells. In addition, palbociclib-mediated G1 arrest in AR-positive/RB-proficient TNBC cells was attenuated by RB knockdown. Conclusion Our study provided a preclinical rationale in selecting patients who might have therapeutic benefit from combining CDK4/6 inhibitors with AR antagonists.",palbociclib,36.055350553505534

The lack of an effective targeted therapy also leads to a poor prognosis for patients affected by TNBC. In the present study, we repurposed the distinctive inhibitory effects of flubendazole, a traditional anthelmintic drug, towards the putative modulation of proliferation and migration of TNBC in vitro and in vivo. Methods: According to a series of experimental approaches, including immunofluorescence (IF), immunoblotting (IB), siRNA and GFP-mRFP-LC3 plasmid transfection, respectively, we have found that flubendazole is capable of inducing autophagic cell death and apoptosis, thus exerting some anti-proliferative and anti-migration activity in TNBC cells. The therapeutic effects of flubendazole were evaluated by xenograft mouse models, followed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), IF and IB. Changes in the gene expression profiles of flubendazole-treated TNBC cells were analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and validated by IB. The potential binding mode of flubendazole and EVA1A was predicted by molecular docking and demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis. Results: We have presently found that flubendazole exhibits a considerable anti-proliferative activity in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the induction of autophagic cell death appears to be pivotal for flubendazole-mediated growth inhibition of TNBC cells, whereas blocking autophagy was able to improve the survival rate and migration ability of flubendazole-treated TNBC cells. Specifically, RNA-seq analysis showed that flubendazole treatment could promote the up-regulation of EVA1A. Flubendazole may regulate autophagy and apoptosis by targeting EVA1A, thus affecting the mechanisms of TNBC proliferation and migration. Furthermore, Thr113 may be the key amino acid residues for the binding of flubendazole to EVA1A. Conclusion: Our results provide novel insights towards the putative anti-cancer efficacy of flubendazole. Furthermore, here we show that flubendazole could serve as a potential therapeutic drug in TNBC. Altogether, this study highlights the possibility of this repurposed autophagic inducer for future cancer treatments.",flubendazole,35.555350553505534

Therefore, TNBC treatment remains a challenge. Targeting programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), for example, atezolizumab, has revolutionized the treatment for various cancer types. However, the therapeutic efficacy of targeting PD-L1 in TNBC is currently under investigation. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which the human TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231, expressing PD-L1, responds to atezolizumab, using RNA-Seq. Transcriptome analysis revealed 388 upregulated and 362 downregulated genes in response to atezolizumab treatment. The expression of selected genes, from RNA-Seq data, was subsequently validated using RT-qPCR in the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cells following atezolizumab treatment. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that atezolizumab downregulates genes promoting cell migration/invasion and metastasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell growth/proliferation/survival, and hypoxia. On the contrary, genes associated with apoptosis and DNA repair were upregulated in response to atezolizumab treatment. Gene set enrichment analyses revealed that a significant number of these genes are related to the NF-kB, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, MAPK, and CD40 signaling pathways. Using functional assays, we confirmed that atezolizumab increases MDA-MB-231 cell apoptosis/necrosis, and reduces their proliferation and viability. Collectively, our findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms/signaling pathways by which atezolizumab exerts inhibitory effects on TNBC, thereby inhibiting EMT/metastasis, tumor growth/survival, and the induction of hypoxia.",atezolizumab,35.055350553505534

The FA-GNR@Pt hybrid nanoparticles are designed to integrate the photothermal conversion property of GNRs, the superior biocompatibility of polypeptide poly(l-glutamic acid) (PGA), the chemotoxicity of cisplatin, and the tumor targeting ability of FA into one single nanoplatform. In combination with localized near infrared (NIR) laser illumination, the resulting FA-GNR@Pt hybrid nanoparticles are able to significantly inhibit the growth of the TNBC tumor when administered systemically. In particular, they can extensively suppress the dissemination of TNBC cells from the primary tumor to the lung by eliminating the peripheral tumor blood vessels.

Material/Method qRT-PCR analysis was performed to study miR-27a expression in TNBC lines MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 and in normal human breast epithelial cell line MCF10A. Dual luciferase assay was performed to verify a putative downstream target of miR-27a, CDC27.

Here, we demonstrated the inhibitory effect of berberine (BBR) on tumor growth and metastasis of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells via suppression of TGF-β1 expression. Methods: The levels of mRNA expression were analyzed by real-time PCR. The levels of MMP-2, MMP-9 and TGF-β1 protein expression were analyzed by zymography and confocal microscopy, respectively. Cell migration was analyzed by wound healing assay. Tumorigenicity of TNBC cells such as tumor growth and metastasis was analyzed using xenograft models. Results: In a clinical data set, aberrant TGF-β1 expression was associated with poor prognosis of breast cancer patients. Our in vitro results using TNBC cells showed that the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 and the capacity for cell migration were increased by TGF-β1 treatment. In contrast, basal levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were suppressed by a specific TGF-β receptor I inhibitor, SB431542. In addition, TGF-β1–induced MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and cell migration were decreased by SB431542. Interestingly, we showed for the first time that BBR decreased the level of TGF-β1, but not TGF-β2, in TNBC cells. Furthermore, BBR significantly decreased the level of MMP-2 expression as well as the capacity for cell migration in TNBC cells. Finally, we examined the effect of BBR on in vivo tumor growth and lung metastasis in MDA-MB231 and 4T1 breast cancer xenograft models and showed that both were significantly decreased following BBR treatment. Conclusion: BBR suppresses tumorigenicity of TNBC cells through inhibition of TGF-β1 expression.

Here, we report the effects on apoptosis and autophagy in human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines after treatment with cantharidin and attempt to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Methods: MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with cantharidin and cell proliferation was examined using CCK-8 and clone formation assays. The expression of apoptosis- and autophagy-associated proteins was detected by western blotting. Cells were infected with lentivirus carrying the Beclin-1 gene, and MDA-MB-231-beclin1 (MB231-Bec) and MDA-MB-468-beclin-1(MB468-Bec) cells stably expressing Beclin-1 were established. Autophagic vacuoles in cells were observed with LC3 staining using fluorescence microscopy, and apoptotic cells were detected via flow cytometry. Tumor growth was assessed by subcutaneous inoculation of TNBC cells into BALB/c nude mice. Results: Cantharidin inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, and induced cell apoptosis. Cantharidin additionally inhibited the conversion of LC3 I to LC3 II and autophagosome formation by suppressing the expression of Beclin-1. Furthermore, overexpression of Beclin-1 in TNBC cells attenuated the cytotoxicity of cantharidin. In vivo, cantharidin inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 xenografts in nude mice by suppressing autophagy and inducing apoptosis, and Beclin-1 overexpression in TNBC cells reduced the efficacy of cantharidin. Conclusions: Cantharidin inhibits autophagy by suppressing Beclin-1 expression and inducing apoptosis of TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo, thereby representing a potential strategy for the treatment of TNBC.",cantharidin,34.055350553505534

Although its prevalence among newly diagnosed breast cancers is approximately 12.7%, it accounts for 40% of breast cancer-related mortality. Higher mortality rates among TNBC is partly because of the lack of targeted therapies and the development of resistance to chemotherapy. We discuss several important mechanisms that lead to chemoresistance and focus on important pathways and biological features that can be potentially exploited to develop therapies for TNBC. TNBC is currently defined by the absence of ER, PR, and Her2 and the greatest leap for TNBC would be our ability to characterize them with the presence of ‘x’ proteins. With this review, we intend to highlight the key nodes of TNBC and push the field towards connecting the dots between key features of TNBC and novel drug(s). Abstract Metastatic progression and tumor recurrence pertaining to TNBC are certainly the leading cause of breast cancer-related mortality; however, the mechanisms underlying TNBC chemoresistance, metastasis, and tumor relapse remain somewhat ambiguous. TNBCs show 77% of the overall 4-year survival rate compared to other breast cancer subtypes (82.7 to 92.5%). TNBC is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, with chemotherapy being the major approved treatment strategy. Activation of ABC transporters and DNA damage response genes alongside an enrichment of cancer stem cells and metabolic reprogramming upon chemotherapy contribute to the selection of chemoresistant cells, majorly responsible for the failure of anti-chemotherapeutic regime. These selected chemoresistant cells further lead to distant metastasis and tumor relapse. The present review discusses the approved standard of care and targetable molecular mechanisms in chemoresistance and provides a comprehensive update regarding the recent advances in TNBC management.",chemotherapy,34.055350553505534

The development of strategies by targeting tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to stimulate their ability of Programmed Cell Removal (PrCR) provides a promising new immunotherapy for TNBC treatment. Methods CD47 is a critical self-protective “don’t eat me” signal on multiple human cancers against macrophage immunosurveillance. Using human and mouse TNBC preclinical models, we evaluated the efficacy of PrCR-based immunotherapy by blocking CD47. We performed high-throughput screens on FDA-approved anti-cancer small molecule compounds for agents potentiating PrCR and enhancing the efficacy of CD47-targeted therapy for TNBC treatment. Results We showed that CD47 was widely expressed on TNBC cells and TAMs represented the most abundant immune cell population in TNBC tumors. Blockade of CD47 enabled PrCR of TNBC cells, but the efficacy was not satisfactory. Our high-throughput screens identified cabazitaxel in enhancing PrCR-based immunotherapy. A combination of CD47 blockade and cabazitaxel treatment yielded a highly effective treatment strategy, promoting PrCR of TNBC cells and inhibiting tumor development and metastasis in preclinical models. We demonstrated that cabazitaxel potentiated PrCR by activating macrophages, independent of its cytotoxicity toward cancer cells. When treated with cabazitaxel, the molecular and phenotypic signatures of macrophages were polarized toward M1 state, and the NF-kB signaling pathway became activated. Conclusion The combination of CD47 blockade and macrophage activation by cabazitaxel synergizes to vastly enhance the elimination of TNBC cells. Our results show that targeting macrophages is a promising and effective strategy for TNBC treatment.",cabazitaxel,34.055350553505534

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by the lack of expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. It is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer and accounts for 12–20% of all breast cancer cases. TNBC is associated with younger age of onset, greater metastatic potential, higher incidence of relapse, and lower overall survival rates. Based on molecular phenotype, TNBC has been classified into six subtypes (BL1, BL2, M, MES, LAR, and IM). TNBC treatment is challenging due to its heterogeneity, highly invasive nature, and relatively poor therapeutics response. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are conventional strategies for the treatment of TNBC. Recent research in TNBC and mechanistic understanding of disease pathogenesis using cutting-edge technologies has led to the unfolding of new lines of therapies that have been incorporated into clinical practice. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and immune checkpoint inhibitors have made their way to the current TNBC treatment paradigm. This review focuses on the classification, features, and treatment progress in TNBC. Histological subtypes connected to recurrence, molecular classification of TNBC, targeted therapy for early and advanced TNBC, and advances in non-coding RNA in therapy are the key highlights in this review.",chemotherapy,34.055350553505534

Recently, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced/metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has demonstrated efficacy, including longer progression-free survival and increased overall survival in subsets of patients. Based on clinical benefit in randomized trials, ICIs in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of some patients with advanced/metastatic TNBC have been approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA), expanding options for patients. Ongoing questions remain, however, about the optimal chemotherapy backbone for immunotherapy, appropriate biomarker-based selection of patients for treatment, the optimal strategy for immunotherapy treatment in earlier stage disease, and potential use in histological subtypes other than TNBC. To provide guidance to the oncology community on these and other important concerns, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts to develop a clinical practice guideline (CPG). The expert panel drew upon the published literature as well as their clinical experience to develop recommendations for healthcare professionals on these important aspects of immunotherapeutic treatment for breast cancer, including diagnostic testing, treatment planning, immune-related adverse events (irAEs), and patient quality of life (QOL) considerations.

The lack of targeted therapies available for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients who fail to respond to first-line chemotherapy has sparked interest in immunotherapeutic approaches. However, trials utilizing checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in TNBC have had underwhelming responses. Here, we investigated the interplay between type I IFN signaling and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and tested the impact of combining IFN inducers, as immune activators, with anti–PD-1, to induce an antimetastatic immune response. Using models of TNBC, we demonstrated an interplay between type I IFN signaling and tumor cell PD-L1 expression that affected therapeutic response. The data revealed that the type I IFN-inducer poly(I:C) was an effective immune activator and antimetastatic agent, functioning better than anti–PD-1, which was ineffective as a single agent. Poly(I:C) treatment induced PD-L1 expression on TNBC cells, and combined poly(I:C) and anti–PD-1 treatment prolonged metastasis-free survival in a neoadjuvant setting via the induction of a tumor-specific T-cell response. Use of this combination in a late treatment setting did not impact metastasis-free survival, indicating that timing was critical for immunotherapeutic benefit. Together, these data demonstrated anti–PD-1 as an ineffective single agent in preclinical models of TNBC. However, type I IFN inducers were effective immune activators, and neoadjuvant trials combining them with anti–PD-1 to induce a sustained antitumor immune response are warranted.

However, the feature of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) frequently overexpressed in TNBC offers the opportunity to employ lapatinib, a dual-tyrosine kinase inhibitor of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) and EGFR, in the treatment of brain metastasis of TNBC. Unfortunately, the low oral bioavailability of lapatinib and drug efflux by blood-brain barrier have resulted in low drug delivery efficiency into the brain and limited therapeutic effects for patients with brain metastasis in clinical trials. To overcome such disadvantages, we developed lapatinib-loaded human serum albumin (HSA) nanoparticles, named LHNPs, by modified nanoparticle albumin-bound (Nab) technology. LHNPs had a core-shell structure and the new HSA/phosphatidylcholine sheath made LHNPs stable in bloodstream. Compared to free lapatinib, LHNPs could inhibit the adhesion, migration and invasion ability of high brain-metastatic 4T1 cells more effectively in vitro. Tissue distribution following intravenous administration revealed that LHNPs (i.v., 10 mg/kg) achieved increased delivery to the metastatic brain at 5.43 and 4.36 times the levels of Tykerb (p.o., 100 mg/kg) and lapatinib solution (LS, i.v., 10 mg/kg), respectively. Compared to the marketed Tykerb group, LHNPs had markedly better inhibition effects on brain micrometastasis and significantly extended the median survival time of 4T1 brain metastatic mice in consequence. The improved anti-tumor efficacy of LHNPs could be partly ascribed to down-regulating metastasis-related proteins. Therefore, these results clearly indicated that LHNPs could become a promising candidate for clinical applications against brain metastasis of TNBC.",lapatinib,33.555350553505534

We engineered a novel nanobioconjugate based on a poly(β-L-malic acid) (PMLA) nanoplatform for TNBC treatment. The nanobioconjugate carries anti-tumor nucleosome-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2C5 to target breast cancer cells, anti-mouse transferrin receptor (TfR) antibody for drug delivery through the host endothelial system, and Morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (AON) to inhibit EGFR synthesis. The nanobioconjugates variants were: (1) P (BioPolymer) with AON, 2C5 and anti-TfR for tumor endothelial and cancer cell targeting, and EGFR suppression (P/AON/2C5/TfR), and (2) P with AON and 2C5 (P/AON/2C5). Controls included (3) P with 2C5 but without AON (P/2C5), (4) PBS, and (5) P with PEG and leucine ester (LOEt) for endosomal escape (P/mPEG/LOEt). Drugs were injected intravenously to MDA-MB-468 TNBC bearing mice. Tissue accumulation of injected nanobioconjugates labeled with Alexa Fluor 680 was examined by Xenogen IVIS 200 (live imaging) and confocal microscopy of tissue sections. Levels of EGFR, phosphorylated and total Akt in tumor samples were detected by western blotting. In vitro western blot showed that the leading nanobioconjugate P/AON/2C5/TfR inhibited EGFR synthesis significantly better than naked AON. In vivo imaging revealed that 2C5 increased drug-tumor accumulation. Significant tumor growth inhibition was observed in mice treated with the lead nanobioconjugate (1) [P = 0.03 vs. controls; P<0.05 vs. nanobioconjugate variant (2)]. Lead nanobioconjugate (1) also showed stronger inhibition of EGFR expression and Akt phosphorylation than other treatments. Treatment of TNBC with the new nanobioconjugate results in tumor growth arrest by inhibiting EGFR and its downstream signaling intermediate, phosphorylated Akt.

We conducted an exploratory analysis of patients with TNBC treated in the single-arm routine oncology practice ATHENA study. Methods: Patients with previously untreated LR/mBC received standard first-line chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks, until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient/physician decision). Results: Of 2,264 patients treated in ATHENA, 585 (26%) had TNBC. Most patients received single-agent taxane with bevacizumab. In the TNBC subgroup, the overall response rate was 49%, including complete responses in 10%; only 16% had primary resistant disease. Median time to progression was 7.2 months (95% CI 6.6–7.8) and median overall survival was 18.3 months (95% CI 16.4–19.7). The 1-year overall survival rate was 60%.

Because triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most refractory to current anti-cancer therapies, efficient treatment has been urgently required. Members of the Bcl-2 family play pro- and anti-apoptotic roles in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Some Bcl-2 family members are expressed in breast cancer and influence the response to anti-cancer therapies. In this study, we investigated whether Bcl-2 inhibition could sensitize TNBC cells to the genotoxic drug doxorubicin (DR). Treatment with a combination of the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-199 and DR synergistically decreased the viability of the TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and BT-549. In an apoptosis assay, the combination treatment resulted in only a marginal effect in BT-549 cells, whereas drastic apoptosis was induced in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with both ABT-199 and DR. Both caspase-8 and -9 were involved in the combination treatment-induced apoptosis. Short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Bcl-2 increased the sensitivity of both cell lines to DR. The combination treatment also significantly decreased the colony-forming ability of the TNBC cell lines. In a xenograft mouse model, oral administration of ABT-199 augmented the DR-induced antitumor effect on subcutaneously established MDA-MB-231 cells. These results indicate that the combination of DR with Bcl-2 inhibitors, including ABT-199, may be a promising treatment modality for TNBC patients.",doxorubicin,33.555350553505534

An effective treatment for TNBC should prevent and even eliminate metastasis as well as suppress primary lesion expansion. Recent progress reveals that platelets can be recruited and activated by tumor cells through intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM), and help aggressive circulating tumor cells (CTCs) form metastasis. Therefore, activated platelets are considered with possession of tumor‐homing, CTC‐capturing, and metastasis‐targeting abilities. In this work, a P‐selectin (expressed on activated platelet surface) targeting peptide (PSN) is modified on a redox‐responsive paclitaxel‐loaded micelle (PSN‐PEG‐SS‐PTX4 micelle) to utilize activated platelets as a “bridge” for interaction with cancer cells. The PSN‐modified micelle can easily adhere to the surface of activated platelets and subsequently capture CTCs in blood circulation. Compared to Taxol and PEG‐SS‐PTX4 micelle, PSN‐PEG‐SS‐PTX4 micelle also exhibits enhanced primary TNBC/metastasis targeting and penetrating effect through binding with tumor infiltrating platelets and thus significantly improves treatment outcome. More importantly, PSN‐PEG‐SS‐PTX4 micelle potently suppressed lung metastasis of TNBC and reduced incidence of distant liver metastasis. The activated platelet‐targeting redox‐responsive micelle system provides a promising prospect for the omnidirectional treatment of metastatic cancer.",paclitaxel,33.055350553505534

Inhibition of Wnt-1 by siRNA significantly reduced the ability of CSCs to form mammospheres compared to control. However, maximum effect was seen in cisplatin plus TRAIL-treated cells.

Current treatment options for TNBC patients are restricted to chemotherapy; however tyrosine kinases are promising druggable targets due to their high expression in multiple TNBC subtypes. Since coexpression of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) can promote signaling crosstalk and cell survival in the presence of kinase inhibitors, it is likely that multiple RTKs will need to be inhibited to enhance therapeutic benefit and prevent resistance. The MET and EGFR receptors are actionable targets due to their high expression in TNBC; however crosstalk between MET and EGFR has been implicated in therapeutic resistance to single agent use of MET or EGFR inhibitors in several cancer types. Therefore it is likely that dual inhibition of MET and EGFR is required to prevent crosstalk signaling and acquired resistance. In this study, we evaluated the heterogeneity of MET and EGFR expression and activation in primary and metastatic TNBC tumorgrafts and determined the efficacy of MET (MGCD265 or crizotinib) and/or EGFR (erlotinib) inhibition against TNBC progression. Here we demonstrate that combined MET and EGFR inhibition with either MGCD265 and erlotinib treatment or crizotinib and erlotinib treatment were highly effective at abrogating tumor growth and significantly decreased the variability in treatment response compared to monotherapy.

As available targeted treatments are not effective, aggressive chemotherapy is frequently advocated for patients with TNBC. It is now becoming apparent that TNBC is not one entity but constitutes a range of malignancies with different clinical behaviour. This paper reviews 7 distinct histological subtypes of TNBC where the overall prognosis is favourable, and aggressive systemic treatment is generally not indicated. Their recognition and separation from the larger group of no special type TNBC are important. The members of the European Working Group for Breast Screening Pathology review the morphology, known molecular features and reported outcomes, and formulate a consensus statement regarding the approach to the subtypes that are associated with a favourable prognosis. Abstract Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), as a group of tumours, have a worse prognosis than stage-matched non-TNBC and lack the benefits of routinely available targeted therapy. However, TNBC is a heterogeneous group of neoplasms, which includes some special type carcinomas with a relatively indolent course. This review on behalf of the European Working Group for Breast Screening Pathology reviews the literature on the special histological types of BC that are reported to have a triple negative phenotype and indolent behaviour. These include adenoid cystic carcinoma of classical type, low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma, fibromatosis-like metaplastic carcinoma, low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma, secretory carcinoma, acinic cell carcinoma, and tall cell carcinoma with reversed polarity. The pathological and known molecular features as well as clinical data including treatment and prognosis of these special TNBC subtypes are summarised and it is concluded that many patients with these rare TNBC pure subtypes are unlikely to benefit from systemic chemotherapy. A consensus statement of the working group relating to the multidisciplinary approach and treatment of these rare tumour types concludes the review.",chemotherapy,32.055350553505534

TNBC cells have increased intracellular oxidative stress and suppressed glutathione, a major antioxidant system, but still, are protected against higher oxidative stress. We screened a panel of antioxidant genes using the TCGA and METABRIC databases and found that expression of the thioredoxin pathway genes is significantly upregulated in TNBC patients compared to non‐TNBC patients and is correlated with adverse survival outcomes. Treatment with auranofin (AF), an FDA‐approved thioredoxin reductase inhibitor caused specific cell death and impaired the growth of TNBC cells grown as spheroids. Furthermore, AF treatment exerted a significant in vivo antitumor activity in multiple TNBC models including the syngeneic 4T1.2 model, MDA‐MB‐231 xenograft and patient‐derived tumor xenograft by inhibiting thioredoxin redox activity. We, for the first time, showed that AF increased CD8+Ve T‐cell tumor infiltration in vivo and upregulated immune checkpoint PD‐L1 expression in an ERK1/2‐MYC‐dependent manner. Moreover, combination of AF with anti‐PD‐L1 antibody synergistically impaired the growth of 4T1.2 primary tumors.

Here, we report the drastic overexpression of miR-221/222 in all of four TNBC cell lines and TNBC primary tumor samples from patients. Furthermore, we demonstrate by both ex vivo and xenograft experiments that inhibiting miR-221/222 expression in a TNBC cell line (MDA-MB-231) suppresses its proliferation, viability, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and migration; whereas expressing miR-221/222 in a non-TNBC line (MCF7) promotes all of the above cancer properties. miR-221/222 achieve so by directly repressing multiple negative regulators of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, including WIF1, SFRP2, DKK2, and AXIN2, to activate the pathway. Notably, the level of miR-221/222 expression is inversely correlated whereas that of WIF1, DKK2, SFRP2, and AXIN2 expression is positively correlated with the patient survival.

Endogenous HuR expression was higher in TNBC cells compared to normal cells. siRNA mediated knockdown of HuR (siHuR) markedly reduced HuR mRNA and protein levels compared to scrambled siRNA (siScr) treatment. Further, siHuR treatment sensitized TNBC cells to ionizing radiation at 2 Gy compared to siScr treatment as evidenced by the significant reduction in clonogenic cell survival from 59%, 49%, and 65% in siScr-treated cells to 40%, 33%, and 46% in siHuR-treated MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and Hs578t cells, respectively.

MiR-18a is a miRNA that is aberrantly overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, its biophysical function in TNBC is still not clear. In this study, we investigated the association among miR-18a dysregulation, Dicer dysregulation and paclitaxel (PTX) resistance in TNBC cells.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
20 TNBC patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery were recruited. MiR-18a expression was quantified using QRT-PCR. The effects of miR-18a overexpression or knockdown on cell viability and apoptosis of PTX sensitive MDA-MB-231 cells and PTX resistant MDA-MB-231 cells after PTX treatment were studied. The influence of miR-18a overexpression on Dicer expression was measured by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis.


RESULTS
Tissues from patients with stable disease (SD, n = 5) and progressive disease (PD, n = 2) to paclitaxel (PTX) containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy had significantly higher miR-18a expression than that from patients with partial response (PR, n = 13). MDA-MB-231/PTX cells had higher miR-18a expression than MDA-MB-231 cells. MiR-18a overexpression directly led to Dicer repression at mRNA and protein level. MiR-18a overexpression significantly increased PTX IC50 and reduced PTX induced cell apoptosis, while miR-18a suppression substantially decreased PTX IC50 and increased PTX induced cell apoptosis.


CONCLUSIONS
This study found that miR-18a is an important miRNA that suppresses Dicer expression and increases PTX resistance in TNBC cells.",paclitaxel,31.555350553505534
Bisphenol A Increases the Migration and Invasion of Triple‐Negative Breast Cancer Cells via Oestrogen‐related Receptor Gamma,"[{'authorId': '2118046101', 'name': 'Xiao-lin Zhang'}, {'authorId': '143881186', 'name': 'Na Liu'}, {'authorId': '12167891', 'name': 'Shan-Fan Weng'}, {'authorId': '144622370', 'name': 'Hong-Sheng Wang'}]",58,2016.0,2996e0fa333c9ff6c0d92e0d348adcf00ada93e2,"Triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by great metastasis and invasion capability. Our study revealed that nanomolar bisphenol A (BPA), one of the most ubiquitous endocrine disruptors, can increase wound closure and invasion of both MDA‐MB‐231 and BT‐549 cells. BPA treatment can increase protein and mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinase‐2 (MMP‐2) and MMP‐9, while had no effect on the expression of vimentin (Vim) and fibronectin (FN) in TNBC cells. The expression of G‐protein‐coupled receptor (GPER), which has been suggested to mediate rapid oestrogenic signals, was not varied in BPA‐treated MDA‐MB‐231 and BT‐549 cells. Its inhibitor G15 also had no effect on BPA‐induced MMPs expression and cell invasion. Interestingly, BPA treatment can significantly increase the mRNA and protein expressions of oestrogen‐related receptor γ (ERRγ), but not ERRα or ERRβ, in both MDA‐MB‐231 and BT‐549 cells. The knock‐down of ERRγ can markedly attenuate BPA‐induced expression of MMP‐2 and MMP‐9 in TNBC cells. BPA treatment can activate both ERK1/2 and Akt in TNBC cells. Both inhibitors of ERK1/2 (PD98059) and Akt (LY294002) can attenuate BPA‐induced ERRγ expression and cell invasion of MDA‐MB‐231 cells. Collectively, our data revealed that BPA can increase the expression of MMPs and in vitro motility of TNBC cells via ERRγ. Both activation of ERK1/2 and Akt participated in this process. Our study suggests that more attention should be paid to the roles of xenoestrogens such as BPA in the development and progression of TNBC.",Bisphenol-A,31.555350553505534

This is largely due to cancer plasticity and the development of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Recently, distinct yet interconvertible mesenchymal‐like and epithelial‐like states have been revealed in breast CSCs. Thus, strategies capable of simultaneously inhibiting bulk and CSC populations in both mesenchymal and epithelial states have yet to be developed. Wnt/β‐catenin and Hippo/YAP pathways are crucial in tumorigenesis, but importantly also possess tumor suppressor functions in certain contexts. One possibility is that TNBC cells in epithelial or mesenchymal state may differently affect Wnt/β‐catenin and Hippo/YAP signaling and CSC phenotypes. In this report, we found that YAP signaling and CD44high/CD24−/low CSCs were upregulated while Wnt/β‐catenin signaling and ALDH+ CSCs were downregulated in mesenchymal‐like TNBC cells, and vice versa in their epithelial‐like counterparts. Dual knockdown of YAP and Wnt/β‐catenin, but neither alone, was required for effective suppression of both CD44high/CD24−/low and ALDH+ CSC populations in mesenchymal and epithelial TNBC cells. These observations were confirmed with cultured tumor fragments prepared from patients with TNBC after treatment with Wnt inhibitor ICG‐001 and YAP inhibitor simvastatin. In addition, a clinical database showed that decreased gene expression of Wnt and YAP was positively correlated with decreased ALDH and CD44 expression in patients’ samples while increased patient survival. Furthermore, tumor growth of TNBC cells in either epithelial or mesenchymal state was retarded, and both CD44high/CD24−/low and ALDH+ CSC subpopulations were diminished in a human xenograft model after dual administration of ICG‐001 and simvastatin. Tumorigenicity was also hampered after secondary transplantation. These data suggest a new therapeutic strategy for TNBC via dual Wnt and YAP inhibition.",ICG-001,31.555350553505534

TNBCs are associated with an overall poor prognosis because they lack expression of therapeutic targets like ERα and are biologically more aggressive. A second estrogen receptor, ERβ, has been found to be expressed in 50% to 90% of ERα-negative breast cancers, and ERβ expression in TNBCs has been shown to correlate with improved disease-free survival and good prognosis. To elucidate the role of ERβ in regulating gene expression and cell proliferation in TNBC cells, the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-468 was engineered with inducible expression of full-length ERβ. In culture, ERβ expression inhibited cell growth by inducing a G1 cell cycle arrest, which was further enhanced by 17β-estradiol treatment. In xenografts, ERβ expression also inhibited tumor formation and growth, and 17β-estradiol treatment resulted in rapid tumor regression. Furthermore, genomic RNA sequencing identified both ligand-dependent and -independent ERβ target genes, some of which were also regulated by ERβ in other TNBC cell lines and correlated with ERβ expression in a cohort of TNBCs from the Cancer Genome Atlas Network. ERβ target genes were enriched in genes that regulate cell death and survival, cell movement, cell development, and growth and proliferation, as well as genes involved in the Wnt/β-catenin and the G1/S cell cycle phase checkpoint pathways. In addition to confirming the anti-proliferative effects of ERβ in TNBC cells, these data provide a comprehensive resource of ERβ target genes and suggest that ERβ may be targeted with ligands that can stimulate its growth inhibitory effects.",ERβ,31.055350553505534

Therefore, the identification of new therapeutic regimes for the treatment of metastatic disease is desirable. ccRCC and TNBC cell lines were treated with the HDAC inhibitor romidepsin and the methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine, two epigenetic modifying drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of various hematologic malignancies. Cell proliferation analysis, flow cytometry, quantitative PCR, and immunoblotting techniques were used to evaluate the antitumor synergy of this drug combination and identify the reexpression of epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes. Combinatorial treatment of metastatic TNBC and stage IV ccRCC cell lines with romidepsin/decitabine leads to synergistic inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis above levels of individual drug treatments alone. Synergistic reexpression of the tumor suppressor gene secreted frizzled-related protein one (sFRP1) was observed in combinatorial drug-treated groups. Silencing sFRP1 (short hairpin RNA) before combinatorial drug treatment showed that sFRP1 mediates the growth inhibitory and apoptotic activity of combined romidepsin/decitabine. Furthermore, addition of recombinant sFRP1 to ccRCC or TNBC cells inhibits cell growth in a dose-dependent manner through the induction of apoptosis, identifying that epigenetic silencing of sFRP1 contributes to renal and breast cancer cell survival. Combinatorial treatment with romidepsin and decitabine in drug resistant tumors is a promising treatment strategy. Moreover, recombinant sFRP1 may be a novel therapeutic strategy for cancers with suppressed sFRP1 expression. Mol Cancer Ther; 11(10); 2105–15. ©2012 AACR.",romidepsin,30.555350553505534

Recent evidence suggests that some patients with TNBC harbour germ-line mutations in DNA repair genes which may render their tumours susceptible to novel therapies such as treatment with PARP inhibitors. In the present study, we have investigated a hospital-based series of 40 German patients with TNBC for the presence of germ-line mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, and BRD7 genes. Microfluidic array PCR and next-generation sequencing was used for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis while conventional high-resolution melting and Sanger sequencing was applied to study the coding regions of PALB2 and BRD7, respectively. Truncating mutations in BRCA1 were found in six patients, and truncating mutations in BRCA2 and PALB2 were detected in one patient each, whereas no truncating mutation was identified in BRD7. One patient was a double heterozygote for the PALB2 mutation, c.758insT, and a BRCA1 mutation, c.927delA.

Recent interest has focused on the significance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) on the efficacies and outcomes of the treatment in breast cancer (BC). Based on the recent international recommendation to standardize the evaluation method, the clinical validity and utility of TILs in patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) were investigated in the present study.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
TILs were evaluated in 177 patients with BC treated with NAC and subsequent curative surgery. The correlation between TILs evaluated according to the standard method and prognosis, including the efficacy of NAC, was investigated retrospectively.


RESULTS
In the high-TIL group (n=96) compared to the low-TIL group (n=81), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (p<0.001) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-enriched breast cancer (HER2BC) (p=0.040) were significantly more frequent, and the pathological complete response (pCR) rate was significantly higher (p=0.003). Among patients with TNBC and those with HER2BC, the pCR rate was significantly higher in the high-TIL group than in the low-TIL group (p=0.013 and p=0.014, respectively). Multivariable analysis also showed that high-TIL status was an independent factor predicting favorable prognosis (hazard ratio(HR)=0.24, p=0.023 and HR=0.13, p=0.036). Biopsy specimens from local recurrence after successful NAC frequently showed TILs decreased.


CONCLUSION
TILs may be a biomarker for predicting treatment response to NAC in patients with TNBC and HER2BC. A decrease in TILs may also be associated with tumor recurrence.",neoadjuvant,30.555350553505534

Current treatment options for patients with TNBC include a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and/or systemic chemotherapy. FDA-approved therapies that target DNA damage repair mechanisms in TNBC, such as PARP inhibitors, only provide marginal clinical benefit. The immunogenic nature of TNBC has prompted researchers to harness the body's natural immune system to treat this aggressive breast cancer. Clinical precedent has been recently established with the FDA approval of two TNBC immunotherapies, including an antibody–drug conjugate and an anti-programmed death-ligand 1 monoclonal antibody. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, a type of adoptive cell therapy that combines the antigen specificity of an antibody with the effector functions of a T cell, has emerged as a promising immunotherapeutic strategy to improve the survival rates of patients with TNBC. Unlike the remarkable clinical success of CAR-T cell therapies in hematologic cancers with Kymriah and Yescarta, the development of CAR-T cell therapies for solid tumors has been much slower and is associated with unique challenges, including a hostile tumor microenvironment.

The development of effective treatment strategies therefore represents a pressing unmet clinical need. We previously identified a molecularly targeted approach to target aberrant epigenetics of TNBC using a peptide corresponding to the SIN3 interaction domain (SID) of MAD. SID peptide selectively blocked binding of SID-containing proteins to the paired α-helix (PAH2) domain of SIN3, resulting in epigenetic and transcriptional modulation of genes associated with epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). To find small molecule inhibitor (SMI) mimetics of SID peptide, we performed an in silico screen for PAH2 domain–binding compounds. This led to the identification of the avermectin macrocyclic lactone derivatives selamectin and ivermectin (Mectizan) as candidate compounds. Both selamectin and ivermectin phenocopied the effects of SID peptide to block SIN3–PAH2 interaction with MAD, induce expression of CDH1 and ESR1, and restore tamoxifen sensitivity in MDA-MB-231 human and MMTV-Myc mouse TNBC cells in vitro. Treatment with selamectin or ivermectin led to transcriptional modulation of genes associated with EMT and maintenance of a cancer stem cell phenotype in TNBC cells. This resulted in impairment of clonogenic self-renewal in vitro and inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Underlining the potential of avermectins in TNBC, pathway analysis revealed that selamectin also modulated the expression of therapeutically targetable genes. Consistent with this, an unbiased drug screen in TNBC cells identified selamectin-induced sensitization to a number of drugs, including those targeting modulated genes.

Metabolizing cancer chemoresistance Triple-negative breast cancer is an aggressive malignancy that is not susceptible to hormone inhibition and must therefore be treated with conventional chemotherapy. This includes neoadjuvant chemotherapy, where the treatment is initiated before surgical resection, but unfortunately, patients develop resistance to this intervention, which makes it difficult to fully eradicate their tumors. By tracking individual tumor cell clones and analyzing the genomics of patient-derived xenografts, Echeverria et al. found that this resistance to neoadjuvant therapy can be mediated by a reversible mechanism targetable by a pharmacological inhibitor of mitochondrial metabolism. Eradicating triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) resistant to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is a critical unmet clinical need. In this study, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of treatment-naïve TNBC and serial biopsies from TNBC patients undergoing NACT were used to elucidate mechanisms of chemoresistance in the neoadjuvant setting. Barcode-mediated clonal tracking and genomic sequencing of PDX tumors revealed that residual tumors remaining after treatment with standard frontline chemotherapies, doxorubicin (Adriamycin) combined with cyclophosphamide (AC), maintained the subclonal architecture of untreated tumors, yet their transcriptomes, proteomes, and histologic features were distinct from those of untreated tumors. Once treatment was halted, residual tumors gave rise to AC-sensitive tumors with similar transcriptomes, proteomes, and histological features to those of untreated tumors. Together, these results demonstrated that tumors can adopt a reversible drug-tolerant state that does not involve clonal selection as an AC resistance mechanism. Serial biopsies obtained from patients with TNBC undergoing NACT revealed similar histologic changes and maintenance of stable subclonal architecture, demonstrating that AC-treated PDXs capture molecular features characteristic of human TNBC chemoresistance. Last, pharmacologic inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation using an inhibitor currently in phase 1 clinical development delayed residual tumor regrowth. Thus, AC resistance in treatment-naïve TNBC can be mediated by nonselective mechanisms that confer a reversible chemotherapy-tolerant state with targetable vulnerabilities.",doxorubicin,30.055350553505534

We evaluated brain penetrance and efficacy of carboplatin ± the PARP inhibitor ABT888, and investigated gene-expression changes in murine intracranial TNBC models stratified by BRCA and molecular subtype status. Athymic mice were inoculated intracerebrally with BRCA-mutant: SUM149 (basal), MDA-MB-436 (claudin-low); or BRCA–wild-type (wt): MDA-MB-468 (basal), MDA-MB-231BR (claudin-low). TNBC cells were treated with PBS control [intraperitoneal (IP), weekly], carboplatin (50 mg/kg/wk, IP), ABT888 (25 mg/kg/d, oral gavage), or their combination. DNA damage (γ-H2AX), apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3, cC3), and gene expression were measured in intracranial tumors. Carboplatin ± ABT888 significantly improved survival in BRCA-mutant intracranial models compared with control, but did not improve survival in BRCA-wt intracranial models. Carboplatin + ABT888 revealed a modest survival advantage versus carboplatin in BRCA-mutant models. ABT888 yielded a marginal survival benefit in the MDA-MB-436, but not in the SUM149 model.

Whether loss of the three factors contributes to deregulate genes that participate in the progress of TNBC remains unknown. Methods: We performed microRNA arrays and comprehensive analysis to screen for miRNAs that are transcriptionally regulated by ER-α, HER2 and PR. Functional assays and molecular mechanism studies were used to investigate the role of miR-4306 in TNBC. An orthotopic mouse model of TNBC was used to evaluate the therapeutic potential of a cholesterol-conjugated miR-4306 mimic. Results: We found that miR-4306 is transcriptionally regulated by ER-α, HER2 and PR, and the downregulation of miR-4306 in TNBC is caused by the loss of ER-α, HER2 and PR. Clinically, low miR-4306 expression is strongly associated with lymph node metastasis and poor survival for TNBC. Upregulation of miR-4306 greatly suppresses TNBC cell proliferation, migration and invasion and abrogates angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in vitro. According to in vivo models, miR-4306 overexpression considerably inhibits TNBC growth, lung metastasis, angiogenesis and lymph node metastasis. Mechanistic analyses indicate that miR-4306 directly targets SIX1/Cdc42/VEGFA to inactivate the signaling pathways mediated by SIX1/Cdc42/VEGFA. Finally, the orthotopic mouse model of TNBC reveals that miR-4306 mimic can be used for TNBC treatment in combination with cisplatin.

This study explores the use of hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol)-conjugated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA-PEG-NPs) as delivery system to improve the antitumor effect of antiobesity drug orlistat for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) therapy by improving its bioavailability.


MATERIALS & METHODS
PLGA-PEG-NPs were synthesized by emulsion-diffusion-evaporation method, and the experiments were conducted in vitro in MDA-MB-231 and SKBr3 TNBC and normal breast fibroblast cells.


RESULTS
Delivery of orlistat via PLGA-PEG-NPs reduced its IC50 compared with free orlistat. Combined treatment of orlistat-loaded NPs and doxorubicin or antisense-miR-21-loaded NPs significantly enhanced apoptotic effect compared with independent doxorubicin, anti-miR-21-loaded NPs, orlistat-loaded NPs or free orlistat treatments.


CONCLUSION
We demonstrate that orlistat in combination with antisense-miR-21 or current chemotherapy holds great promise as a novel and versatile treatment agent for TNBC.",orlistat,29.555350553505534

Gene expression profiling has identified at least six different triple-negative subtypes with different biology and sensitivity to therapies. The heterogeneous nature of TN tumors may justify the difficulty in treating this BC subtype. Several targeted agents have been investigated in clinical trials without demonstrating a clear survival benefit. Therefore, systemic chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of current clinical practice. Improving the knowledge of tumor biology is mandatory for patient management. In stages II and III, neoadjuvant systemic treatment is an effective option of care. The achievement of a pathological complete response represents an optimal surrogate for survival outcome as well as a test for tumor drug sensitivity. In this review, we provide a brief description of the main predictive biomarkers for tumor response to systemic treatment. Moreover, we review the treatment strategies investigated for TNBCs in neoadjuvant settings focusing on experimental drugs such as immunotherapy and poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase inhibitors that hold promise in the treatment of this aggressive disease. Therefore, the management of TNBC represents an urgent, current, unmet need in daily clinical practice.

A winning combination A phase 1/2 clinical trial tested an inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NMMA) combined with taxane in patients with chemorefractory, locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) and metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The overall response rate was 45.8% (11 of 24): 81.8% (9 of 11) for patients with LABC and 15.4% (2 of 13) for patients with metastatic TNBC. Among the patients with LABC, three patients had a pathological complete response at surgery (27.3%). There was remodeling of the immune environment in the tumors of responders that correlated with lower arginase expression. This L-NMMA and taxane chemotherapy combination warrants further investigation in larger clinical studies of patients with breast cancer. The inducible nitric oxide signaling (iNOS) pathway is associated with poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Prior studies using in vivo models showed that inhibition of the iNOS signaling pathway using the pan-NOS inhibitor NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (L-NMMA) reduced tumor growth and enhanced survival in patients with TNBC. Here, we report a first-in-class phase 1/2 trial of L-NMMA combined with taxane for treating patients with chemorefractory, locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) or metastatic TNBC. We also examined immune cell correlates of chemotherapy response. 35 patients with metastatic TNBC were recruited: 15 in the phase 1 trial and 24 in the phase 2 trial (including 4 recommended phase 2 dose patients from the phase 1 trial). The overall response rate was 45.8% (11 of 24): 81.8% (9 of 11) for patients with LABC and 15.4% (2 of 13) for patients with metastatic TNBC. Among the patients with LABC, three patients had a pathological complete response at surgery (27.3%). Grade ≥3 toxicity was noted in 21% of patients; however, no adverse events were attributed to L-NMMA. Immune cells analyzed by CyTOF indicated that chemotherapy nonresponders showed greater expression of markers associated with M2 macrophage polarization and increased concentrations of circulating IL-6 and IL-10 cytokines. In contrast, chemotherapy responders showed an increase in CD15+ neutrophils in blood, as well as a decrease in arginase (a marker of protumor N2 neutrophils) in tumor biopsies obtained at the end of treatment. L-NMMA combined with taxane warrants further investigation in larger clinical studies of patients with breast cancer.",L-NMMA,29.055350553505534

Although studies have shown an increased expression of LRP6 in several types of cancer, its function in tumor development and progression remains to be elucidated. We herein demonstrated that LRP6 expression is up‐regulated in human triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients and human TNBC cell lines, and that knockdown of LRP6 expression and treatment of recombinant Mesd protein (a specific inhibitor of LRP6) significantly decreased cell migration and invasion of TNBC MDA‐MB‐231 and BT549 cells. Interestingly, the effects of LRP6 knockdown and Mesd treatment on TNBC cell migration and invasion were more prominent than on TNBC cell proliferation/viability. Mechanistically, LRP6 knockdown and Mesd treatment inhibited Wnt/β‐catenin signaling and decreased the expression of S100A4, a mediator of cancer metastasis and a specific target of Wnt/β‐catenin signaling, in TNBC cells. Together, our data suggest that LRP6 promotes TNBC cell migration and invasion by regulating the expression and function of S100A4 via the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway. J. Cell.

Triple-negative breast cancer is one of the most aggressive types of breast cancer as it has the worst clinical outcome for patients. microRNAs are a type of small non-coding RNA and play an important role in breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential function and mechanism of miR-143-3p in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). MTT and colony formation assays, the effect of miR-143-3p modulation on MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation, revealed that increased miR-143-3p expression inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells. Moreover, miR-143-3p overexpression inhibited the movement of MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells in wound healing and transwell assays. To identify a potential miR-143-3p target, we investigated the effect of miR-143-3p modulation on LIMK1 expression level. Increased miR-143-3p expression caused a reduction in LIMK1 mRNA and protein, suggesting that LIMK1 is a target of miR-143-3p. In addition, dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that LIMK1 is a target gene of miR-143-3p. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that miR-143-3p arrested MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells at the G0/G1 phase. The TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database demonstrated that miR-143-3p was down-regulated in breast cancer tissues compared with normal breast tissues. These data demonstrated that miR-143-3p functioned as a suppressor gene in TNBC and that miR-143 targeted therapy may be a new strategy for TNBC treatment.",miR-143-3p,29.055350553505534

Using in vitro coincubation experiments with target cells and in vivo antitumor experiments in mice, we found that the coexpressed C7R can significantly improve the activation, cell proliferation, and cytotoxicity of CAR-T cells. In addition, the in vivo experiments suggested that the enhanced CAR-T cells displayed significant antitumor activity in a TNBC subcutaneous xenograft model, in which in vivo, the survival time of CAR-T cells was prolonged.

Using ChIP-seq, we demonstrate that the cistrome for the AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun is comprised of 13,800 binding regions in TNFα-stimulated TNBC cells. In addition, we show that c-Jun regulates nearly a third of the TNFα-regulated transcriptome. Interestingly, high expression level of the c-Jun-regulated pro-invasion gene program is associated with poor clinical outcome in TNBCs. We further demonstrate that c-Jun drives TNFα-mediated increase of malignant characteristics of TNBC cells by transcriptional regulation of Ninj1. As exemplified by the CXC chemokine genes clustered on chromosome 4, we demonstrate that NF-κB might be a pioneer factor required for the regulation of TNFα-inducible inflammatory genes, whereas c-Jun has little effect.

Breast cancers arising from the luminal mammary duct often express estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2). Tumors expressing ER and/or PR are treated with anti-hormonal therapies, while tumors overexpressing HER2 are targeted with monoclonal antibodies. Immunohistochemical detection of ER, PR, and HER2 receptors/proteins is a critical step in breast cancer diagnosis and guided treatment. Breast tumors that do not express these proteins are known as “triple negative breast cancer” (TNBC) and are typically basal-like. TNBCs are the most aggressive subtype, with the highest mortality rates and no targeted therapy, so there is a pressing need to identify important TNBC tumor regulators. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) transcription factor has been previously implicated as a constitutively active oncogene in TNBC. However, its direct regulatory gene targets and tumorigenic properties have not been well characterized. By integrating RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data from 2 TNBC tumors and 5 cell lines, we discovered novel gene signatures directly regulated by STAT3 that were enriched for processes involving inflammation, immunity, and invasion in TNBC. Functional analysis revealed that STAT3 has a key role regulating invasion and metastasis, a characteristic often associated with TNBC.

One such adaptive pathway is the unfolded protein (UPR) or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response mediated in part by the ER-localized transmembrane sensor IRE12 and its substrate XBP13. Previous studies report UPR activation in various human tumors4-6, but XBP1's role in cancer progression in mammary epithelial cells is largely unknown. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a form of breast cancer in which tumor cells do not express the genes for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Her2/neu, is a highly aggressive malignancy with limited treatment options7, 8. Here, we report that XBP1 is activated in TNBC and plays a pivotal role in the tumorigenicity and progression of this human breast cancer subtype. In breast cancer cell line models, depletion of XBP1 inhibited tumor growth and tumor relapse and reduced the CD44high/CD24low population. Hypoxia-inducing factor (HIF)1α is known to be hyperactivated in TNBCs 9, 10. Genome-wide mapping of the XBP1 transcriptional regulatory network revealed that XBP1 drives TNBC tumorigenicity by assembling a transcriptional complex with HIF1α that regulates the expression of HIF1α targets via the recruitment of RNA polymerase II. Analysis of independent cohorts of patients with TNBC revealed a specific XBP1 gene expression signature that was highly correlated with HIF1α and hypoxia-driven signatures and that strongly associated with poor prognosis. Our findings reveal a key function for the XBP1 branch of the UPR in TNBC and imply that targeting this pathway may offer alternative treatment strategies for this aggressive subtype of breast cancer. We determined UPR activation status in several breast cancer cell lines (BCCL). XBP1 expression was readily detected in both luminal and basal-like BCCL, but was higher in the latter which consist primarily of TNBC cells and also in primary TNBC patient samples (Fig. 1a, b). PERK but not ATF6 was also activated (Extended Data 1a) and transmission electron microscopy revealed more abundant and dilated ER in multiple TNBC cell lines (Extended Data 1b). These data reveal a state of basal ER stress in TNBC cells. XBP1 silencing impaired soft agar colony forming ability and invasiveness (Extended Data 1c) of multiple TNBC cell lines, indicating that XBP1 regulates TNBC anchorageindependent growth and invasiveness. We next used an orthotopic xenograft mouse model with inducible expression of two XBP1 shRNAs in MDA-MB-231 cells. Tumor growth and metastasis to lung were significantly inhibited by XBP1 shRNAs (Fig. 1c-e, Extended Data 1d-g). This was not due to altered apoptosis (Caspase 3), cell proliferation (Ki67) or hyperactivation of IRE1 and other UPR branches (Fig. 1e, Extended Data 1h, i). Instead, XBP1 depletion impaired angiogenesis as evidenced by the presence of fewer intratumoral blood vessels (CD31 staining) (Fig. 1e). Subcutaneous xenograft experiments using two other TNBC cell lines confirmed our findings (Extended Data 1j, k). Importantly, XBP1 Chen et al. Page 2 Nature.

N IH -P A A uhor M anscript N IH -P A A uhor M anscript N IH -P A A uhor M anscript silencing in a patient-derived TNBC xenograft model (BCM-2147) significantly decreased tumor incidence (Fig. 1f, Extended Data 1l, m). TNBC patients have the highest rate of relapse within 1-3 years despite adjuvant chemotherapy7, 8. To examine XBP1's effect on tumor relapse following chemotherapeutic treatment, we treated MDA-MB-231 xenograft bearing mice with doxorubicin and XBP1 shRNA. Strikingly, combination treatment not only blocked tumor growth but also inhibited or delayed tumor relapse (Fig. 2a). Tumor cells expressing CD44high/CD24low have been shown to mediate tumor relapse in some instances11-13. To test whether XBP1 targeted the CD44high/CD24low population, we examined the mammosphere-forming ability of cells derived from treated tumors (day 20). Mammosphere formation was increased in doxorubicin treated tumor cells, while tumors treated with doxorubicin plus XBP1 shRNA displayed substantially reduced mammosphere formation (Fig. 2b), a finding confirmed using another chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel (Extended Data 2a, b). Hypoxia activates the UPR, and XBP1 knockdown also dramatically reduced mammosphere formation in hypoxic conditions (Extended Data. 2b). Furthermore, CD44 expression was reduced in XBP1-depleted tumors (Extended Data 2c). To further interrogate XBP1's effect on CD44high/CD24low cell function, we used mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) carrying an inducible Src oncogene (ER-Src), where v-Src is fused with the estrogen receptor ligand binding domain14. Tamoxifen (TAM) treatment results in neoplastic transformation and gain of a CD44high/CD24low population that has been previously associated with tumor-initiating properties15. In transformed MCF10A-ERSrc cells, XBP1 splicing was increased in CD44high/CD24low population (Fig. 2c), while XBP1 silencing reduced the CD44high/CD24low fraction (Extended Data 2d, e) and markedly suppressed mammosphere formation (Extended Data 2f), phenotypes not attributable to a direct effect of XBP1 on cell viability (Extended Data 2g, h). Furthermore, limiting dilution experiments demonstrated loss of tumor-seeding ability in XBP1-depleted cells (Fig. 2d). CD44high/CD24low cells sorted from TNBC patient samples confirmed increased XBP1 splicing and other UPR markers, and XBP1 silencing impaired mammosphere-forming ability (Fig. 2e, f, Extended Data 3a). Conversely, XBP1s overexpression in CD44low/ CD24high cells resulted in gain of mammosphere-forming ability and increased resistance to doxorubicin treatment (Extended Data 3b, c). Strikingly, patient derived CD44low/CD24high cells overexpressing XBP1s, but not control parental cells, initiated tumor formation in immunodeficient mice (Extended Data 3d, e). These data establish a critical role of XBP1 in CD44high/CD24low cells within TNBC. ChIP-seq and motif analysis of XBP1 in MDA-MB-231 cells revealed statistically significant enrichment of both the HIF1α and XBP1 motifs (Fig. 3a, Extended Data 4a), suggesting frequent colocalization of HIF1α and XBP1 to the same regulatory elements. HIF1α is hyperactivated in TNBCs, required for the maintenance of CD44high/CD24low cells9, 10, 16, 17 and regulated in response to microenvironmental oxygen levels. XBP1 ChIPseq was therefore also performed in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells cultured under hypoxia and glucose deprivation conditions for 24h. Exposure to these stressors increased XBP1 splicing, resulting in a corresponding increase in signal intensity (Extended Data 4b-f) Chen et al. Page 3 Nature.

HIF1α motif enrichment in the XBP1 ChIP-seq dataset suggested that XBP1 and HIF1α might interact within the same transcriptional complex. Co-IP experiments revealed a physical interaction of HIF1α, but not HIF2α, with XBP1 in 293T cells co-expressing HIF1 and XBP1s cultured under hypoxic conditions, also observed with endogenous proteins in two TNBC cell lines: MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T (Fig. 3b, Extended Data 4h-j). Subcellular fractionation revealed that this interaction occurs in the nucleus, and that unspliced XBP1u protein was not detectable (Extended Data 4k, l). GST pull-down experiments showed that HIF1α interacts with the XBP1s N-terminus b-zip domain (Extended Data 4m, n). We next established that XBP1 and HIF1α co-occupied several well-known HIF1α targets using ChIP-qPCR (Extended Data 5a-c). ChIP-re-ChIP assays using anti-XBP1s followed by anti-HIF1α antibodies confirmed that XBP1s and HIF1α simultaneously co-occupy these common targets (Extended Data. 5d). DNA-pull down assays with an HIF1α18 specific probe precipitated XBP1s in MDA-MB-231 nuclear extracts under hypoxia, indicating their presence in the same complex (Extended Data 5e, f). XBP1 depletion by two independent shRNA constructs dramatically reduced hypoxia response element (HRE) luciferase activity under hypoxia (Fig. 3c). Conversely, XBP1s expression dose-dependently transactivated the HRE reporter (Extended Data 5g, h), confirming that XBP1 augments HIF1α activity. When we profiled the differential transcriptome induced by XBP1 silencing in MDAMB-231 cells, gene set enrichment analysis identified significant enrichment of HIF1α mediated hypoxia response pathway genes (Fig. 3d, Extended Data 6a). XBP1 depletion downregulated HIF1α targets VEGFA, PDK1, GLUT1, and DDIT4 expression in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Extended Data 6b), and these results were validated in breast cancer xenografts (Fig. 3e) and Hs578T cells (Extended Data 6c). However, XBP1 depletion in luminal tumors did not affect these targets (Extended Data 6d). To further explore the consequences of this cooperation, we examined how XBP1 or HIF1α loss affected the transcription of common target genes. We found that high occupancy by XBP1 was associated with increased occurrence of the HIF1α motif across the genome in TNBC (Fig. 3f). While XBP1 depletion had no immediate effect on HIF1α expression, it substantially attenuated concurrent HIF1α and RNA polymerase II occupancy (Extended Data 6e-g, Fig. 3g). Similarly, XBP1 and RNA Polymerase II occupancy at co-bound sites was likewise reduced in the absence of HIF1α under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3h, Extended Data 6h-l). These results indicate that the assembly of the XBP1-HIF1α complex on target promoters is crucial for their transcription, via the recruitment of RNA polymerase II. To establish whether HIF1α contributes to XBP1's function in TNBC, we performed rescue experiments using a HA",XBP1,27.555350553505534

It is desirable and beneficial to treat TNBC cells of different phenotypes with the most appropriate drugs. Here, we report a 78 nm, chlorin e6-, docetaxel-, and anti-Twist siRNA-containing polymeric nanoparticle (CDTN) with spatiotemporally specific activity when irradiated by light. Under conditions mimicking superficial tumor tissue with sufficient light input, TNBC cells are mainly killed by the photodynamic therapy (PDT) function of CDTNs. In contrast, under conditions mimicking deep tumor tissue with weak light input, PDT potentiates chemotherapy (CT) and gene therapy (GT) by facilitating the endolysosomal escape of CDTNs. Compared with free drugs, CDTNs improve the intratumoral exposure of docetaxel and anti-Twist siRNA by 2.5- and 2-fold, respectively. When combined with laser irradiation applied at the time of maximal intratumoral accumulation, the CDTNs significantly inhibit the growth of primary tumors and their lung metastasis (both >80%) by killing the peripheral cells, mainly through PDT and prohibiting the growth and metastasis of deep cells through PDT as enhanced CT and GT. On the contrary, dual-modality nanomedicine lacking CT, GT, or PDT showed fast primary tumor growth, poor metastasis control, or both, respectively. This study reveals the spatiotemporally specific mechanism of CDTNs in treating metastatic TNBC and highlights the importance of combined therapy in treating TNBC.",docetaxel,27.555350553505534

The resistant MDA-MB-231/IR cells were enhanced in migration, invasion, and stem cell-like characteristics. Pathway analysis by the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery revealed that the NF-κB pathway, TNF signaling pathway, and Toll-like receptor pathway were enriched in MDA-MB-231/IR cells. Among 77 differentially expressed genes revealed by transcriptome analysis, 12 genes involved in drug and radiation resistance, including interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2), were identified. We found that baicalein effectively reversed the expression of IFIT2, which is reported to be associated with metastasis, recurrence, and poor prognosis in TNBC patients. Baicalein sensitized radio- and chemoresistant cells and induced apoptosis, while suppressing stem cell-like characteristics, such as mammosphere formation, side population, expression of Oct3/4 and ABCG2, and CD44highCD24low population in MDA-MB-231/IR cells.

However, this is rapidly changing due to a variety of conceptually important clinical trials and emerging new options such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates. Evidence also increasingly supports that platinum drugs and inhibitors of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, or PARP, are particularly effective in the treatment of germline BRCA-mutant cancers, including TNBC. An important development in early-stage TNBC was the recognition that extensive residual cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy identifies patients who remain at high risk for recurrence. This has led to the design of two ongoing adjuvant trials (one testing pembrolizumab, the other investigating platinum drugs and capecitabine) that offer a ""second chance"" to improve the survival of patients with residual cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Genomic analysis of TNBC has revealed large-scale transcriptional, mutational, and copy number heterogeneity, without any frequently recurrent mutations, other than TP53. Consistent with this molecular heterogeneity, most targeted agents, so far, have demonstrated low overall activity in unselected TNBC, but important ""basket"" trials are ongoing.",pembrolizumab,27.055350553505534

To identify the mechanism by which residual cancer cells survive chemotherapy, we initially conducted gene expression profiling using the CRL2335 TNBC cell line derived from a squamous breast carcinoma before and after treatment with cisplatin plus TRAIL. We found a significant increase in the expression of FZD8, one of Wnt receptors, and its downstream targets LEF1 and TCF in residual CRL2335 tumor cells after treatment with cisplatin plus TRAIL. Increased FZD8 levels were further confirmed in other TNBC cell lines. Inhibition of FZD8 by siRNA in CRL2335 cells in the presence of cisplatin plus TRAIL reduced β-catenin and survivin levels and increased apoptosis compared with scrambled siRNA–treated cells. In vivo data show that cisplatin plus TRAIL treatment significantly reduces tumor volume in NOD/SCID mice. However, we found that cisplatin plus TRAIL treatment predominantly eliminated non–tumor-initiating cells, as shown by whole-body fluorescent imaging of mice injected with mammosphere-forming CRL2335 cells stably transfected with DsRed. This led to TIC enrichment in residual tumors, as confirmed by immunostaining for TIC markers. Moreover, an increase in FZD8 expression was observed in residual tumors treated with cisplatin and TRAIL. Taken together, our findings suggest that FZD8-mediated Wnt signaling may play a major role in mediating resistance to chemotherapy, making it a potential target to enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy in patients with TNBCs.

Here, we undertook a comprehensive evaluation of the activity of ganetespib, a potent inhibitor of HSP90, in this malignancy. Experimental Design: The antitumor and antimetastatic activity of ganetespib was investigated using TNBC cell lines and xenograft models. Combinatorial drug analyses were performed with chemotherapeutic agents and concomitant effects on DNA damage and cell-cycle disruption were assessed in vitro; antitumor efficacy was assessed in vivo. Metabolic and objective tumor responses were evaluated in patients with metastatic TNBC undergoing ganetespib treatment. Results: Ganetespib simultaneously deactivated multiple oncogenic pathways to potently reduce cell viability in TNBC cell lines, and suppressed lung metastases in experimental models. Ganetespib potentiated the cytotoxic activity of doxorubicin via enhanced DNA damage and mitotic arrest, conferring superior efficacy to the doxorubicin–cyclophosphamide regimen in TNBC xenografts. Ganetespib also promoted mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis in combination with taxanes in vitro, and these effects translated to significantly improved combinatorial activity in vivo. Marked tumor shrinkage of metastatic lung and lymphatic lesions were seen in patients on ganetespib monotherapy. Conclusion: The preclinical activity profile and clinical evidence of tumor regression suggest that ganetespib offers considerable promise as a new therapeutic candidate to target TNBC.

Increased stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) have been associated with a favorable prognosis in TNBC. However, whether this association holds for patients who are node-negative (N0), young (< 40 years), and chemotherapy-naïve, and thus can be used for chemotherapy de-escalation strategies, is unknown. METHODS We selected all patients with N0 TNBC diagnosed between 1989 and 2000 from a Dutch population–based registry. Patients were age < 40 years at diagnosis and had not received (neo)adjuvant systemic therapy, as was standard practice at the time. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks were retrieved (PALGA: Dutch Pathology Registry), and a pathology review including sTILs was performed. Patients were categorized according to sTILs (< 30%, 30%-75%, and ≥ 75%). Multivariable Cox regression was performed for overall survival, with or without sTILs as a covariate. Cumulative incidence of distant metastasis or death was analyzed in a competing risk model, with second primary tumors as competing risk. RESULTS sTILs were scored for 441 patients. High sTILs (≥ 75%; 21%) translated into an excellent prognosis with a 15-year cumulative incidence of a distant metastasis or death of only 2.1% (95% CI, 0 to 5.0), whereas low sTILs (< 30%; 52%) had an unfavorable prognosis with a 15-year cumulative incidence of a distant metastasis or death of 38.4% (32.1 to 44.6). In addition, every 10% increment of sTILs decreased the risk of death by 19% (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.81; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.87), which are an independent predictor adding prognostic information to standard clinicopathologic variables (χ2 = 46.7, P < .001). CONCLUSION Chemotherapy-naïve, young patients with N0 TNBC with high sTILs (≥ 75%) have an excellent long-term prognosis. Therefore, sTILs should be considered for prospective clinical trials investigating (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy de-escalation strategies. Young cancer patients with TNBC and high sTILs have an excellent outcome, even without systemic treatment",chemotherapy,26.555350553505534

Chemoresistance and lack of targeted therapeutics are major hindrances to effective treatments in the clinic and are crucial causes of a worse prognosis and high rate of relapse/recurrence in patients diagnosed with TNBC. In the last decade, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to perform a pivotal role in most cellular functions. The aberrant functional expression of lncRNAs plays an ever-increasing role in the progression of diverse malignancies, including TNBC. Therefore, lncRNAs have been recently studied as predictors and modifiers of chemoresistance.

New tumor-specific radiosensitizers are needed. We hypothesized that the ATR inhibitor, VX-970 (now known as M6620), would preferentially radiosensitize TNBC. Noncancerous breast epithelial and TNBC cell lines were investigated in clonogenic survival, cell cycle, and DNA damage signaling and repair assays. In addition, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models generated prospectively as part of a neoadjuvant chemotherapy study from either baseline tumor biopsies or surgical specimens with chemoresistant residual disease were assessed for sensitivity to fractionated radiotherapy, VX-970, or the combination. To explore potential response biomarkers, exome sequencing was assessed for germline and/or somatic alterations in homologous recombination (HR) genes and other alterations associated with ATR inhibitor sensitivity. VX-970 preferentially inhibited ATR-Chk1-CDC25a signaling, abrogated the radiotherapy-induced G2–M checkpoint, delayed resolution of DNA double-strand breaks, and reduced colony formation after radiotherapy in TNBC cells relative to normal-like breast epithelial cells. In vivo, VX-970 did not exhibit significant single-agent activity at the dose administered even in the context of genomic alterations predictive of ATR inhibitor responsiveness, but significantly sensitized TNBC PDXs to radiotherapy. Exome sequencing and functional testing demonstrated that combination therapy was effective in both HR-proficient and -deficient models. PDXs established from patients with chemoresistant TNBC were also highly radiosensitized. In conclusion, VX-970 is a tumor-specific radiosensitizer for TNBC. Patients with residual TNBC after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a subset at particularly high risk of relapse, may be ideally suited for this treatment intensification strategy.

Despite initial good response to chemotherapy, 30% of the patients relapse within 5 years after treatment. EGFR overexpression is a common marker in TNBC, and its expression has been correlated with poor outcome. Inhibition of fatty acid synthase (FASN) activity leads to apoptosis of human carcinoma cells overexpressing FASN. We tested the hypothesis that blocking FASN in combination with anti-EGFR signaling agents would be an effective antitumor strategy in sensitive and chemoresistant TNBC. Experimental Design: Several TNBC cell lines and 29 primary tumors were included to determine whether FASN is a potential target in TNBC. Doxorubicin-resistant TNBC cell lines (231DXR and HCCDXR) have been developed and characterized in our laboratory. Cellular and molecular interactions of anti-FASN compounds (EGCG and C75) with cetuximab were analyzed. In vivo tumor growth inhibition was evaluated after cetuximab, EGCG, or the combination in TNBC orthoxenograft models. Results: TNBC cell lines showed overexpression of FASN enzyme and its inhibition correlated to FASN levels. FASN staining was observed in all of the 29 TNBC tumor samples. In vitro, EGCG and C75 plus cetuximab showed strong synergism in sensitive and chemoresistant cells. In vivo, the combination of EGCG with cetuximab displayed strong antitumor activity against the sensitive and chemoresistant TNBC orthoxenografts, without signs of toxicity. Conclusions: Our results show that the simultaneous blockade of FASN and EGFR is effective in preclinical models of sensitive and chemoresistant TNBC.

Additionally, infiltration of tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) promotes tumor progression. Here, a terpolymer‐lipid hybrid nanoparticle (TPLN) system is designed with multiple targeting moieties to first undergo synchronized BBB crossing and then actively target TNBC cells and TAMs in microlesions of brain metastases. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that covalently bound polysorbate 80 in the terpolymer enables the low‐density lipoprotein receptor‐mediated BBB crossing and TAM‐targetability of the TPLN. Conjugation of cyclic internalizing peptide (iRGD) enhances cellular uptake, cytotoxicity, and drug delivery to brain metastases of integrin‐overexpressing TNBC cells. iRGD‐TPLN with coloaded doxorubicin (DOX) and mitomycin C (MMC) (iRGD‐DMTPLN) exhibits higher efficacy in reducing metastatic burden and TAMs than nontargeted DMTPLN or a free DOX/MMC combination. iRGD‐DMTPLN treatment reduces metastatic burden by 6‐fold and 19‐fold and increases host median survival by 1.3‐fold and 1.6‐fold compared to DMTPLN or free DOX/MMC treatments, respectively.

However, the function of AR in TNBC and the mechanisms by which AR-targeted therapy reduces tumor burden are largely unknown. We hypothesized that AR maintains a cancer stem cell (CSC)-like tumor-initiating population and serves as an antiapoptotic factor, facilitating anchorage independence and metastasis. AR levels increased in TNBC cells grown in forced suspension culture compared with those in attached conditions, and cells that expressed AR resisted detachment-induced apoptosis. Culturing TNBC cells in suspension increased the CSC-like population, an effect reversed by AR inhibition. Pretreatment with enzalutamide (Enza) decreased the tumor-initiating capacity of TNBC cells and reduced tumor volume and viability when administered simultaneously or subsequent to the chemotherapeutic paclitaxel; simultaneous treatment more effectively suppressed tumor recurrence. Overall, our findings suggest that AR-targeted therapies may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy even in TNBCs with low AR expression by targeting a CSC-like cell population with anchorage independence and invasive potential.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are associated with Dox resistance in MCF-7 estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) may functionally shift non-CSCs towards CSCs. However, whether Stat3 drives the formation of CSCs during the development of resistance in TNBC, and whether a Stat3 inhibitor reverses CSC-mediated Dox resistance, remains to be elucidated. In the present study, human MDA-MB-468 and murine 4T1 mammary carcinoma cell lines with the typical characteristics of TNBCs, were compared with estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cells as a model system. The MTT assay was used to detect cytotoxicity of Dox. In addition, the expression levels of CSC-specific markers and transcriptional factors were measured by western blotting, immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry. The mammosphere formation assay was used to detect stem cell activity. Under long-term continuous treatment with Dox at a low concentration, TNBC cultures not only exhibited a drug-resistant phenotype, but also showed CSC properties. These Dox-resistant TNBC cells showed activation of Stat3 and high expression levels of pluripotency transcription factors octamer-binding transcription factor-4 (Oct-4) and c-Myc, which was different from the high expression of superoxide dismutase 2 (Sox2) in Dox-resistant MCF-7 cells. WP1066 inhibited the phosphorylation of Stat3, and decreased the expression of Oct-4 and c-Myc, leading to a reduction in the CD44-positive cell population, and restoring the sensitivity of the cells to Dox. Taken together, a novel signal circuit of Stat3/Oct-4/c-Myc was identified for regulating stemness-mediated Dox resistance in TNBC. The Stat3 inhibitor WP1066 was able to overcome the resistance to Dox through decreasing the enrichment of CSCs, highlighting the therapeutic potential of WP1066 as a novel sensitizer of Dox-resistant TNBC.",WP1066,25.555350553505534

There are no specific treatment guidelines for TNBC patients, however, it has been postulated that their phenotypic and molecular similarity to BRCA1-associated cancers would confer sensitivity to certain cytotoxic agents, including platinum. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the clinical outcome of breast cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy who had TNBC compared with those with non-TNBC. Electronic (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases) and manual searches were conducted throughout December 2011 to identify trials evaluating the use of platinum-based chemotherapy for patients with breast cancer. The methodological quality was assessed in accordance with the QUOROM statement. Seven studies met the eligibility criteria, with a total of 717 patients. Of these patients, 225 were TNBC patients (31%), 492 were non-TNBC patients (69%), 275 received platinum-based neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and 442 had advanced/metastatic breast cancers. The results showed that during neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, the clinical complete response (cCR) rate and the pathological complete response (pCR) rates were significantly higher for the TNBC group compared with the non-TNBC group (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.69–6.57; P=0.03 and OR, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.28, 6.53; P= 0.01, respectively). However, in advanced/metastatic breast cancers, the cCR, partial response (PR) and the disease control rates for the TNBC group were not significantly different compared with the non-TNBC group. The 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate for the TNBC group was higher than that of the non-TNBC group in all patients (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.11–2.96; P= 0.02).

Specifically, this work points toward the importance of properly packaging and presenting the adjuvant and antigens such that biodistribution, dendritic cell activation, and therapeutic efficacy can be controlled. Highly heterogenous cancers, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), remain challenging immunotherapeutic targets. Herein, we describe the synthesis and evaluation of immunotherapeutic liposomal spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) for TNBC therapy. The SNAs comprise immunostimulatory oligonucleotides (CpG-1826) as adjuvants and encapsulate lysates derived from TNBC cell lines as antigens. The resulting nanostructures (Lys-SNAs) enhance the codelivery of adjuvant and antigen to immune cells when compared to simple mixtures of lysates with linear oligonucleotides both in vitro and in vivo, and reduce tumor growth relative to simple mixtures of lysate and CpG-1826 (Lys-Mix) in both Py230 and Py8119 orthotopic syngeneic mouse models of TNBC. Furthermore, oxidizing TNBC cells prior to lysis and incorporation into SNAs (OxLys-SNAs) significantly increases the activation of dendritic cells relative to their nonoxidized counterparts. When administered peritumorally in vivo in the EMT6 mouse mammary carcinoma model, OxLys-SNAs significantly increase the population of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and simultaneously decrease the population of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) within the tumor microenvironment, when compared with Lys-SNAs and simple mixtures of oxidized lysates with CpG-1826. Importantly, animals administered OxLys-SNAs exhibit significant antitumor activity and prolonged survival relative to all other treatment groups, and resist tumor rechallenge. Together, these results show that the way lysates are processed and packaged has a profound impact on their immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, this work points toward the potential of oxidized tumor cell lysate-loaded SNAs as a potent class of immunotherapeutics for cancers lacking common therapeutic targets.",OxLys-SNAs,25.555350553505534

Thus, pCR rates may be useful in evaluating novel regimens in TNBC. In advanced TNBC, platinum analogues like Cb are active and addition of B to chemotherapy increases response rates and time to progression. CALGB 40603 is a 2×2 randomized phase II study designed to determine if the addition of either Cb or B to standard NAC significantly increases pCR rates in TNBC. Methods: Pts had operable clinical stage II-III TNBC, defined as hormone receptors Results: 454 pts enrolled, median age 48, stage II 68%/stage III 32%. Of 354 pts with treatment data, 59 did not complete NAC, 30 withdrew due to AEs, more often with B vs. not (11.5% vs. 3.5%). B was discontinued in 23% of assigned pts vs. 6-13% for other agents. Grade 3-4 neutropenia (56% vs. 20%) and thrombocytopenia (22% vs. 4%) were more common with Cb vs. not, while grade 3 hypertension was more common with B vs. not (11% vs. There is no evidence of an interaction between the effects of Cb and B (p = 0.64 and 0.44, for breast and breast/axilla, respectively). Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest that adding Cb or B to standard NAC significantly increases pCR rates in stage II-III TNBC. These increases are additive, with pCR (breast) in 60.6% and pCR (breast/axilla) in 50% of pts who received both. Complete and confirmed results will be reported, including pCR rates for basal-like tumors vs. not. Pts will be followed for RFS/OS to assess the impact of pCR on these endpoints.

More than one-third of patients with TNBC will present distant metastases during the course of their disease. Although chemotherapy has been the main treatment option for metastatic TNBC for a long time, this scenario has changed recently with the advent of the polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) for patients harbouring a mutation in the BRCA genes (BRCAmut) and also with the results of immunotherapy in patients with PD-L1-positive tumours. The present manuscript proposes a treatment algorithm for patients with metastatic TNBC based on the currently available, most relevant literature on the topic. For patients with a BRCAmut and able to tolerate chemotherapy, we recommend initiating treatment with platins (carboplatin/cisplatin) and to start PARPis at disease progression. For patients with PD-L1-positive tumours (PD-L1 expression on tumour-infiltrating immune cells ≥1%), we recommend first-line treatment with nab-paclitaxel and atezolizumab, when available. In patients without a BRCA mutation and with PD-L1-negative tumours, we recommend single-agent chemotherapy with taxanes (paclitaxel or docetaxel) as a first-line treatment. In patients with a high disease burden or who are very symptomatic, combinations such as anthracyclines plus cyclophosphamide or platins with taxanes are valid options. Chemotherapy should be maintained until the occurrence of disease progression or limiting toxicities. After progression to first-line chemotherapy, anthracyclines are an option for patients who received taxanes and vice versa. For patients who progressed to taxanes and anthracyclines, or who present contraindications to these agents, fluorouracil/capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, cisplatin/carboplatin, vinorelbine and ixabepilone are alternatives. The treatment of TNBC is constantly evolving, and the inclusion of patients in ongoing trials evaluating new targeted agents, immunotherapy and predictive biomarkers should be encouraged, in an attempt to improve metastatic TNBC treatment outcomes.",PARPis,25.055350553505534

In this study, we found that fisetin dose-dependently inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion in TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells. In addition, fisetin reversed epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) as evaluated by cell morphology and EMT markers in MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells. Furthermore, fisetin suppressed phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-GSK-3β signaling pathway but upregulated the expression of PTEN mRNA and protein in a concentration-dependent manner. Further, silence of PTEN by siRNA abolished these benefits of fisetin on proliferation and metastasis of TNBCs. In vivo, using the metastatic breast cancer xenograft model bearing MDA-MB-231 cells, we found that fisetin dramatically inhibited growth of primary breast tumor and reduced lung metastasis, meanwhile, the expression of EMT molecules and PTEN/Akt/GSK-3β in primary and metastatic tissues changed in the same way as those in vitro experiments. In conclusion, all these results indicated that fisetin could effectively suppress proliferation and metastasis of TNBC and reverse EMT process, which might be mediated by PTEN/Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway.",fisetin,24.555350553505534

Chemotherapy is still the first line for the treatment of TNBC patients; however, TNBC usually gains rapid resistance and unresponsiveness to chemotherapeutic drugs. In this study, we found that TRPV2 protein is highly up-regulated in TNBC tissues compared to normal breast tissues. We also observed that TNBC and estrogen receptor alpha negative (ERβ-) patients with higher TRPV2 expression have significantly higher recurrence free survival compared to patients with lower TRPV2 expression especially those who were treated with chemotherapy. In addition, we showed that TRPV2 overexpression or activation by CBD significantly increased doxorubicin (DOX) uptake and apoptosis in TNBC cells. The induction of DOX uptake was abrogated by TRPV2 blocking or downregulation. In vivo mouse model studies showed that the TNBC tumors derived from CBD+DOX treated mice have significantly reduced weight and increased apoptosis compared to those treated with CBD or DOX alone. Overall, our studies for the first time revealed that TRPV2 might be a good prognostic marker for TNBC and ERβ- breast cancer patient especially for those who are treated with chemotherapy.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) perform multiple cytotoxic actions and are emerging as promising multifunctional agents in TNBC. Areas covered: This review focuses on the challenges so far addressed in the targeted treatment of TNBC and explores the various mechanisms by which HDACis control cancer cell growth, tumor progression and metastases. Pivotal preclinical trials on HDACis like panobinostat, vorinostat, and entinostat show that these epigenetic agents exert an anti-proliferative effect on TNBC cells and control tumor growth by multiple mechanisms of action, including apoptosis and regulation of the epithelial to mesenchimal transition (EMT). Combination studies have reported the synergism of HDACis with other anticancer agents. Expert opinion: In recent years, treatment of TNBC has recorded a high number of failures in the development of targeted agents. HDACis alone or in combination strategies show promising activity in TNBC and could have implications for the future targeted treatment of TNBC patients. Future research should identify which agent synergizes better with HDACis and which patient will benefit more from these epigenetic agents.",HDACis,24.055350553505534

Understanding the mechanisms of cancer metastasis is therefore crucial to identify new therapeutic targets and develop novel treatments to improve patient outcomes. A potential target is the TWIST1 transcription factor, which is often overexpressed in aggressive breast cancers and is a master regulator of cellular migration through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here, we demonstrate an siRNA-based TWIST1 silencing approach with delivery using a modified poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer. Our results demonstrate that SUM1315 TNBC cells efficiently take up PAMAM-siRNA complexes, leading to significant knockdown of TWIST1 and EMT-related target genes. Knockdown lasts up to one week after transfection and leads to a reduction in migration and invasion, as determined by wound healing and transwell assays. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PAMAM dendrimers can deliver siRNA to xenograft orthotopic tumors and siRNA remains in the tumor for at least four hours after treatment. These results suggest that further development of dendrimer-based delivery of siRNA for TWIST1 silencing may lead to a valuable adjunctive therapy for patients with TNBC.",siRNA,24.055350553505534

A lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2 receptor) makes TNBC more aggressive and metastatic. Wnt signaling is one of the important pathways in the cellular process; in TNBC it is aberrantly regulated, which leads to the progression and metastasis. In this study, we designed a therapeutic strategy using a combination of a low dose of paclitaxel and a Wnt signaling inhibitor (XAV939), and examined the effect of the paclitaxel-combined XAV939 treatment on diverse breast cancer lines including TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and BT549) and ER+ve cell lines (MCF-7 and T-47D). The combination treatment of paclitaxel (20 nM) and XAV939 (10 µM) exerted a comparable therapeutic effect on MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, BT549, MCF-7, and T-47D cell lines, relative to paclitaxel with a high dose (200 nM). The paclitaxel-combined XAV939 treatment induced apoptosis by suppressing Bcl-2 and by increasing the cleavage of caspases-3 and PARP. In addition, the in vivo results of the paclitaxel-combined XAV939 treatment in a mice model with the MDA-MB-231 xenograft further confirmed its therapeutic effect. Furthermore, the paclitaxel-combined XAV939 treatment reduced the expression of β-catenin, a key molecule in the Wnt pathway, which led to suppression of the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and angiogenic proteins both at mRNA and protein levels. The expression level of E-cadherin was raised, which potentially indicates the inhibition of EMT. Importantly, the breast tumor induced by pristane was significantly reduced by the paclitaxel-combined XAV939 treatment. Overall, the paclitaxel-combined XAV939 regimen was found to induce apoptosis and to inhibit Wnt signaling, resulting in the suppression of EMT and angiogenesis. For the first time, we report that our combination approach using a low dose of paclitaxel and XAV939 could be conducive to treating TNBC and an external carcinogen-induced breast cancer.",XAV939,24.055350553505534

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is most the aggressive type of breast cancer and is poorly responsive to endocrine therapeutics; however, one of the most attractive treatments is tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-based therapies. To identify compounds that enhance the efficacy of TRAIL-based therapies, we screened 55 compounds from natural products in combination with TRAIL in TNBC cells.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human TNBC cells, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231, and murine TNBC cells, 4T1, were used. Cell viability, apoptotic cells, and cell cycle were quantified by the WST-1 assay, annexin-V/7-amino-actinomycinD (7-AAD) staining and Propidium iodide (PI) staining, respectively. In vivo effects of piperine were evaluated in the orthotopic-inoculated 4T1-luc mouse model.


RESULTS
After screening, we identified piperine as the most potent adjuvant at enhancing the efficacy of TRAIL-based therapies in TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo, which might be mediated through inhibition of survivin and p65 phosphorylation.


CONCLUSION
Piperine may enhance TRAIL-based therapeutics for TNBC.",piperine,22.555350553505534

A prediction model was developed based on independent clinicopathological and miRNA covariates. The prognostic value of the model was further validated in a separate set of 41 TNBC patients diagnosed between 2007 and 2008.

Concomitant capecitabine may be beneficial, but robust data to support this are lacking. The efficacy and safety of the addition of capecitabine into the TNBC adjuvant treatment regimen was evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS This randomized, open-label, phase III trial was conducted in China. Eligible female patients with early TNBC after definitive surgery were randomly assigned (1:1) to either capecitabine (3 cycles of capecitabine and docetaxel followed by 3 cycles of capecitabine, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide) or control treatment (3 cycles of docetaxel followed by 3 cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide). Randomization was centralized without stratification. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS Between June 2012 and December 2013, 636 patients with TNBC were screened, and 585 were randomly assigned to treatment (control, 288; capecitabine, 297). Median follow-up was 67 months. The 5-year DFS rate was higher for capecitabine than for control treatment (86.3% v 80.4%; hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.99; P = .044). Five-year overall survival rates were numerically higher but not significantly improved (capecitabine, 93.3%; control, 90.7%). Overall, 39.1% of patients had capecitabine dose reductions, and 8.4% reported grade ≥ 3 hand-foot syndrome. The most common grade ≥ 3 hematologic toxicities were neutropenia (capecitabine, 136 [45.8%]; control, 118 [41.0%]) and febrile neutropenia (capecitabine, 50 [16.8%]; control, 46 [16.0%]). Safety data were similar to the known capecitabine safety profile and generally comparable between arms. CONCLUSION Capecitabine when added to 3 cycles of docetaxel followed by 3 cycles of a 3-drug anthracycline combination containing capecitabine instead of fluorouracil significantly improved DFS in TNBC without new safety concerns.",capecitabine,22.555350553505534

Overexpression of cyclin E and phosphorylated-CDK2 are correlated with poor survival in patients with TNBC, and the absence of CDK2 desensitizes cells to inhibition of Wee1 kinase, a key cell-cycle regulator. We hypothesize that cyclin E expression can predict response to therapies, which include the Wee1 kinase inhibitor, AZD1775. Experimental Design: Mono- and combination therapies with AZD1775 were evaluated in TNBC cell lines and multiple patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with different cyclin E expression profiles. The mechanism(s) of cyclin E–mediated replicative stress were investigated following cyclin E induction or CRISPR/Cas9 knockout by a number of assays in multiple cell lines. Results: Cyclin E overexpression (i) is enriched in TNBCs with high recurrence rates, (ii) sensitizes TNBC cell lines and PDX models to AZD1775, (iii) leads to CDK2-dependent activation of DNA replication stress pathways, and (iv) increases Wee1 kinase activity. Moreover, treatment of cells with either CDK2 inhibitors or carboplatin leads to transient transcriptional induction of cyclin E (in cyclin E–low tumors) and result in DNA replicative stress. Such drug-mediated cyclin E induction in TNBC cells and PDX models sensitizes them to AZD1775 in a sequential treatment combination strategy. Conclusions: Cyclin E is a potential biomarker of response (i) for AZD1775 as monotherapy in cyclin E–high TNBC tumors and (ii) for sequential combination therapy with CDK2 inhibitor or carboplatin followed by AZD1775 in cyclin E–low TNBC tumors.",AZD1775,22.555350553505534

It is highly heterogeneous and exhibits considerable overlap with basal-like and BRCA-related breast cancers.

This review summarizes recent progress and studies in TNBC and discusses some of the ongoing clinical trials and emerging therapies for the treatment of TNBC. Recent findings Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy and DNA damaging agents continue to be the mainstay for treatment of this disease. The use of targeted agents such as bevacizumab, epidermal growth factor receptor and polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitors have led to conflicting results. However, recent research has prompted evaluation of additional drugs targeting multiple signaling pathways and epigenetic modifications for the treatment of this disease.

The identification of biomarkers predicting the response to NAC could be helpful for personalized treatment. This systematic review provides an overview of putative biomarkers at baseline that are predictive for a pCR following NAC. Embase, Medline and Web of Science were searched for articles published between January 2010 and August 2022. The articles had to meet the following criteria: patients with primary invasive TNBC without distant metastases and patients must have received NAC. In total, 2045 articles were screened by two reviewers resulting in the inclusion of 92 articles. Overall, the most frequently reported biomarkers associated with a pCR were a high expression of Ki-67, an expression of PD-L1 and the abundance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, particularly CD8+ T cells, and corresponding immune gene signatures. In addition, our review reveals proteomic, genomic and transcriptomic markers that relate to cancer cells, the tumor microenvironment and the peripheral blood, which also affect chemo-sensitivity.

In order for CD44 to be induced, YB‐1 must be phosphorylated at S102 by p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK). We therefore questioned whether RSK might be a tractable molecular target to eliminate TICs. In support of this idea, injection of MDA‐MB‐231 cells expressing Flag‐YB‐1 into mice increased tumor growth as well as enhanced CD44 expression. Despite enrichment for TICs, these cells were sensitive to RSK inhibition when treated ex vivo with BI‐D1870. Targeting RSK2 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) or small molecule RSK kinase inhibitors (SL0101 and BI‐D1870) blocked TNBC monolayer cell growth by ∼100%. In a diverse panel of breast tumor cell line models RSK2 siRNA predominantly targeted models of TNBC. RSK2 inhibition decreased CD44 promoter activity, CD44 mRNA, protein expression, and mammosphere formation. CD44+ cells had higher P‐RSKS221/227, P‐YB‐1S102, and mitotic activity relative to CD44− cells. Importantly, RSK2 inhibition specifically suppressed the growth of TICs and triggered cell death. Moreover, silencing RSK2 delayed tumor initiation in mice. In patients, RSK2 mRNA was associated with poor disease‐free survival in a cohort of 244 women with breast cancer that had not received adjuvant treatment, and its expression was highest in the basal‐like breast cancer subtype. Taking this further, we report that P‐RSKS221/227 is present in primary TNBCs and correlates with P‐YB‐1S102 as well as CD44. In conclusion, RSK2 inhibition provides a novel therapeutic avenue for TNBC and holds the promise of eliminating TICs. STEM CELLS2012;30:1338–1348",RSK2,21.555350553505534

Previous preclinical models of chemoresistance in TNBC have suffered from a lack of clinical relevance. Using a single high dose chemotherapy treatment, we developed a novel MDA-MB-436 cell-based model of chemoresistance characterized by a unique and complex morphologic phenotype, which consists of polyploid giant cancer cells giving rise to neuron-like mononuclear daughter cells filled with smaller but functional mitochondria and numerous lipid droplets. This resistant phenotype is associated with metabolic reprogramming with a shift to a greater dependence on fatty acids and oxidative phosphorylation. We validated both the molecular and histologic features of this model in a clinical cohort of primary chemoresistant TNBCs and identified several metabolic vulnerabilities including a dependence on PLIN4, a perilipin coating the observed lipid droplets, expressed both in the TNBC-resistant cells and clinical chemoresistant tumors treated with neoadjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy. These findings thus reveal a novel mechanism of chemotherapy resistance that has therapeutic implications in the treatment of drug-resistant cancer. Implications: These findings underlie the importance of a novel morphologic–metabolic phenotype associated with chemotherapy resistance in TNBC, and bring to light novel therapeutic targets resulting from vulnerabilities in this phenotype, including the expression of PLIN4 essential for stabilizing lipid droplets in resistant cells.",PLIN4,21.055350553505534

TNBC carries a worse prognosis than other breast cancer subtypes, and with the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of TNBC, there is a lack of effective therapeutic targets available. Identification of molecular targets for TNBC subtypes is crucial towards personalized patient stratification. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) has been shown to induce p53 mutation accumulation, basal-like gene signature enrichment and transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) via s-nitrosylation. Herein we report that iNOS is associated with disease recurrence, distant metastasis and decreased breast cancer specific survival in 209 cases of TNBC. Employing TNBC cell lines representing normal basal breast, and basal-like 1 and basal-like 2 tumors, we demonstrate that nitric oxide (NO) induces EGFR-dependent ERK phosphorylation in basal-like TNBC cell lines. Moreover NO mediated cell migration and cell invasion was found to be dependent on EGFR and ERK activation particularly in basal-like 2 TBNC cells. This occurred in conjunction with NF-κB activation and increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8, IL-1β and TNF-α. This provides substantial evidence for EGFR as a therapeutic target to be taken into consideration in the treatment of a specific subset of basal-like TNBC overexpressing iNOS.",EGFR,21.055350553505534

The absence of clinically efficient molecular targets is of great concern in treatment of patients with TNBC. In light of the complexity of TNBC, we applied a systematic and integrative transcriptomics and interactomics approach utilizing transcriptional regulatory and protein-protein interaction networks to discover putative transcriptional control mechanisms of TNBC. To this end, we identified TNBC-driven molecular pathways such as the Janus kinase-signal transducers, and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathways.

Here, we analyzed the transcriptome of two different TNBC cell lines to define a comprehensive list of Wnt target genes. The treatment of cells with Wnt3a for 6h up-regulated the expression (fold change > 1.3) of 59 genes in MDA-MB-468 cells and 241 genes in HCC38 cells. Thirty genes were common to both cell lines. Beta-catenin may also be a transcriptional repressor and we found that 18 and 166 genes were down-regulated in response to Wnt3a treatment for 6h in MDA-MB-468 and HCC38 cells, respectively, of which six were common to both cell lines. Only half of the activated and the repressed transcripts have been previously described as Wnt target genes. Therefore, our study reveals 137 novel genes that may be positively regulated by Wnt3a and 104 novel genes that may be negatively regulated by Wnt3a. These genes are involved in the Wnt pathway itself, and also in TGFβ, p53 and Hedgehog pathways. Thorough characterization of these novel potential Wnt target genes may reveal new regulators of the canonical Wnt pathway. The comparison of our list of Wnt target genes with those published in other cellular contexts confirms the notion that Wnt target genes are tissue-, cell line- and treatment-specific. Genes up-regulated in Wnt3a-stimulated cell lines were more strongly expressed in TNBC than in luminal A breast cancer samples. These genes were also overexpressed, but to a much lesser extent, in HER2+ and luminal B tumors.

The aim of this study was to characterize the mechanism of action of FLU on breast cancer stem cell (BCSC)‐like properties and metastasis in TNBC. FLU treatment caused a significant induction of apoptosis, accompanied by G2/M phase accumulation, caspase‐3/‐7 activation and the dysregulation of STAT3 activation in TNBC cells. The latter phenomenon was associated with impairment of cancer stem‐like traits, concomitant with a reduction in the CD24low/CD44high, CD24high/CD49fhigh subpopulation, ALDH1 activity and mammosphere formation. The BCSC‐enriched populations exhibited enhanced metastasis with higher STAT3 activation, while FLU administration inhibited tumor growth, angiogenesis and lung and liver metastasis, coinciding with decreased MMP‐2 and MMP‐9 levels in circulating blood. FLU kills not only rapid proliferating tumor cells but also effectively eradicates BCSC‐like cells in vitro and in vivo.

LDGI can be efficiently taken up into the stem cells with good biocompatibility to maintain the cellular functions. In addition, CXCR4 on the MSCs is upregulated by iron oxide nanoparticles in the LDGI. Importantly, the drug release and photothermal therapy can be simultaneously achieved upon light irradiation. The released drug can enter the cell nucleus and promote cell apoptosis. Interestingly, light irradiation can control the secretion of cellular microvehicles carrying LDGI for targeted treatment. A remarkable in vitro anticancer effect is observed in MDA‐MB‐231 with near‐infrared laser irradiation. In vivo studies show that the MSCs‐LDGI has the enhanced migration and penetration abilities in the tumor area via both intratumoral and intravenous injection approaches compared with LDGI. Subsequently, MSCs‐LDGI shows the best antitumor efficacy via chemo‐photothermal therapy compared to other treatment groups in the TNBC model of nude mice.

Inhibition of SPHK1 was found to attenuate ERK1/2 and AKT signaling and reduce growth of TNBC cells in vitro and in a xenograft SCID mouse model. Moreover, SPHK1 inhibition by siRNA knockdown or treatment with SKI-5C sensitizes TNBCs to chemotherapeutic drugs.

HFn nanocage improved the solubility, chemical stability, and bioavailability of curcumin, allowing us to reliably carry out several experiments in the attempt to establish the potential of this molecule as a therapeutic agent and elucidate the mechanism of action in TNBC.

However, TNBC is known to be more immunogenic compared to other breast cancer subtypes, with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes playing an important prognostic and predictive role. Furthermore, TNBC has a higher level of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Therapeutic blockade of PD-L1 using atezolizumab is thus expected to activate and enhance tumor-speciﬁc T-cell responses, resulting in improved anti-tumor activity. Areas covered: This review summarizes the development and the impact of the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab in advanced TNBC; it examines the mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics and the available preclinical and clinical data. Expert opinion: Atezolizumab, a novel immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-L1, is an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for metastatic TNBC. In general, TNBC has a high unmet medical need, hence the clinical development of atezolizumab should continue, particularly for TNBC. Indeed, atezolizumab has the potential to substantially augment the therapeutic armamentarium for TNBC. This should lead to improved immunotherapeutic strategies and the enhancement of the outcome for this group of breast cancer patients.",atezolizumab,17.555350553505534

We investigated whether higher peripheral lymphocyte counts are associated with lower breast cancer–specific mortality (BCM) and overall mortality (OM) in TNBC. Experimental Design: Data on treatments and diagnostic tests from electronic medical records of two health care systems were linked with demographic, clinical, pathologic, and mortality data from the California Cancer Registry. Multivariable regression models adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, cancer stage, grade, neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy use, radiotherapy use, and germline BRCA1/2 mutations were used to evaluate associations between absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), BCM, and OM. For a subgroup with TIL data available, we explored the relationship between TILs and peripheral lymphocyte counts. Results: A total of 1,463 stage I–III TNBC patients were diagnosed from 2000 to 2014; 1,113 (76%) received neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy within 1 year of diagnosis. Of 759 patients with available ALC data, 481 (63.4%) were ever lymphopenic (minimum ALC <1.0 K/μL). On multivariable analysis, higher minimum ALC, but not absolute neutrophil count, predicted lower OM [HR = 0.23; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.16–0.35] and BCM (HR = 0.19; CI, 0.11–0.34). Five-year probability of BCM was 15% for patients who were ever lymphopenic versus 4% for those who were not. An exploratory analysis (n = 70) showed a significant association between TILs and higher peripheral lymphocyte counts during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Conclusions: Higher peripheral lymphocyte counts predicted lower mortality from early-stage, potentially curable TNBC, suggesting that immune function may enhance the effectiveness of early TNBC treatment.

The role played by the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and its cognate receptor IGF-1R in TNBC has been reported. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms by which the IGF-1/IGF-1R system may contribute to TNBC progression still remains to be fully understood. By computational analysis of the vast cancer genomics information in public databases (TCGA and METABRIC), we obtained evidence that high IGF-1 or IGF-1R levels correlate with a worse clinical outcome in TNBC patients. Further bioinformatics analysis revealed that both the focal adhesion and the Hippo pathways are enriched in TNBC harboring an elevated expression of IGF-1 or IGF-1R. Mechanistically, we found that in TNBC cells, the IGF-1/IGF-1R system promotes the activation of the FAK signal transduction pathway, which in turn regulates the nuclear accumulation of YAP (yes-associated protein/yes-related protein) and the expression of its target genes. At the biological level, we found that the IGF-1/IGF-1R-FAK-YAP network cascade triggers the growth potential of TNBC cells, as evaluated in different experimental systems.

The loss of tumor suppressor gene PTEN is the most common first event associated with basal-like subtype (Martins, De, Almendro, Gonen, and Park, 2012). Here we report for the first time that the functional upregulation of secreted-MMP7, a transcriptional target of Wnt-β-catenin signature pathway in TNBC is associated to the loss of PTEN. We identified differential expression of mRNAs in several key-components genes, and transcriptional target genes of the Wnt-β-catenin pathway (WP), including beta-catenin, FZD7, DVL1, MMP7, c-MYC, BIRC5, CD44, PPARD, c-MET, and NOTCH1 in FFPE tumors samples from TNBC patients of two independent cohorts. A similar differential upregulation of mRNA/protein for beta-catenin, the functional readout of WP, and for MMP7, a transcriptional target gene of beta-catenin was observed in TNBC cell line models. Genetic or pharmacological attenuation of beta-catenin by SiRNA or WP modulators (XAV939 and sulindac sulfide) and pharmacological mimicking of PTEN following LY294002 treatment downregulated MMP7 levels as well as enzymatic function of the secreted MMP7 in MMP7 positive PTEN-null TNBC cells. Patient data revealed that MMP7 mRNA was high in only a subpopulation of TNBC, and this subpopulation was characterized by a concurrent low expression of PTEN mRNA.

A similar inverse relationship between MMP7 and PTEN mRNA levels was observed in the PAM50 data set (a correlation coefficient of -0.54). The PAM50 subtype and outcome data revealed that the high MMP7 group had low pCR (25%) and High Rd (74%) in clinical stage T3 pathologic response in contrast to the high pCR (40%) and low residual disease (RD) (60%) of the low MMP7 group.",MMP7,17.055350553505534

We exploited genomics data to identify commonly occurring alterations in G-protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subset of breast cancer with poor prognosis and lacking effective targeted therapy. We have discovered that the orphan GPCR, G-protein–coupled receptor 161 (GPR161), is overexpressed specifically in TNBC and correlates with poor prognosis. We identify GPR161 as a regulator of mammary epithelial cell proliferation and invasion in a mammalian target of rapamycin signaling-pathway–dependent manner. Down-regulation of GPR161 in a TNBC-derived cell line impairs cell growth, suggesting that GPR161 is a drug target for breast cancer. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 20% of breast cancer in women and lacks an effective targeted therapy. Therefore, finding common vulnerabilities in these tumors represents an opportunity for more effective treatment. Despite the growing appreciation of G-protein–coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated signaling in cancer pathogenesis, very little is known about the role GPCRs play in TNBC. Using genomic information of human breast cancer, we have discovered that the orphan GPCR, G-protein–coupled receptor 161 (GPR161) is overexpressed specifically in TNBC and correlates with poor prognosis. Knockdown of GPR161 impairs proliferation of human basal breast cancer cell lines. Overexpression of GPR161 in human mammary epithelial cells increases cell proliferation, migration, intracellular accumulation of E-cadherin, and formation of multiacinar structures in 3D culture. GPR161 forms a signaling complex with the scaffold proteins β-arrestin 2 and Ile Gln motif containing GTPase Activating Protein 1, a regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 and E-cadherin. Consistently, GPR161 amplified breast tumors and cells overexpressing GPR161 activate mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and decrease Ile Gln motif containing GTPase Activating Protein 1 phosphorylation. Thus, we identify the orphan GPCR, GPR161, as an important regulator and a potential drug target for TNBC.",GPR161,16.555350553505534

Increasing evidences support that aberrantly expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in tumorigenesis and may serve as biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes of various cancers. In current study, we found that miR-455-3p and miR-196a-5p were intensively overexpressed in TNBC compared with the hormone receptor (HR) positive breast cancer whereas miR-425-5p was down-regulated by miRNA microarray analysis. qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that the expression of miR-455-3p in TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 was higher than that in HR positive breast cancer cell line MCF-7(p<0.01). Functional experiments in vitro showed that miR-455-3p enhanced cell proliferative, invasive and migrational abilities in TNBC cell lines. miRNA targets prediction showed SMAD2, LTBR and etoposide induced 2.4 (EI24) were potential target genes of miR-455-3p, and then it was confirmed by qRT-PCR assay. Dual luciferase reporter assay showed the specific binding of miR-455-3p to 3′ UTR of EI24 in TNBC. Then we found miR-455-3p inhibited the EI24 expression at the levels of mRNA and protein. Through small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting EI24 gene, there were strengthened capabilities of invasion and migration of TNBC cells, and increased expression of EI24 had the inverse effects. In conclusion, the data suggest that miRNA455-3p promotes invasion and migration by targeting tumor suppressor EI24 and might be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in TNBC.",miR-455-3p,16.555350553505534

Experimental Design: We analyzed 165 TNBC samples and 33 paired normal breast tissues using transcriptome microarrays. Tumor-specific mRNAs and lncRNAs were identified and correlated with patients' recurrence-free survival (RFS). Using Cox regression model, we built two multigene signatures incorporating mRNAs and lncRNAs. The prognostic and predictive accuracy of the signatures were tested in a training set of 165 TNBC patients and validated in other 101 TNBC patients. Results: We successfully developed an mRNA and an integrated mRNA–lncRNA signature based on eight mRNAs and two lncRNAs. In the training set, patients in the high-risk group were more likely to suffer from recurrent disease than patients in the low-risk group in both signatures [HR, 10.00; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.53–39.47, P = 0.001; HR = 4.46, 95% CI, 1.34–14.91, P = 0.015 for integrated signature and mRNA signature, respectively). Results were validated in the validation set (P = 0.019 and 0.030, respectively). In addition, time-dependent receiver operating curve showed that the integrated mRNA–lncRNA signature had a better prognostic value than both the eight-mRNA-only signature and the clinicopathologic risk factors in both sets. We also found through interaction analysis that patients classified into the low-risk group by the integrated mRNA–lncRNA signature had a more favorable response to adjuvant taxane chemotherapy. Conclusions: The multigene signature we developed can accurately predict clinical outcome and benefit of taxane chemotherapy in TNBC patients.

A second aim was to characterize the clinical behavior at the time of relapse of TNBC. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical outcomes of patients with metastatic breast cancer who received taxane–platinum chemotherapy as the first‐ or second‐line treatment, focusing on the TN phenotype. In total, 257 patients with metastatic breast cancer received platinum‐containing chemotherapy at Samsung Medical Center from 1999 to 2006. Of these patients, 106 patients with available data on estrogen (ER), progesterone (PgR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor‐2 (HER2) receptor status received taxane–platinum regimen as the first‐ or second‐line treatment. The overall RR of patients with TNBC was 39%. This rate did not differ significantly from those of patients with other phenotypes. The time to death after chemotherapy (19 vs. 50 months, p = 0.037) and overall survival (OS) (21 vs. 56 months, p = 0.030) differed significantly between patients with TNBC and non‐TNBC. TNBC showed a unique locoregional infiltration pattern at relapse, which might reflect its aggressive clinical behavior. Despite the similar response to platinum‐containing chemotherapy, patients with TNBC had a shorter OS than patients with non‐TNBC. The implication of TN phenotype as poor prognostic factor is uncertain, because it needs to be defined whether poor outcome is related to the rapid growing characteristics of tumor itself or the resistance to drug therapy.

RADV displays good colloidal stability to prevent premature drug leakage during the blood circulation and inert photochemotoxicity to avoid nonspecific side effect. RADV passively accumulates at tumor site through the enhanced permeability and retention effect when administrated systemically. Once deposited at the tumor site, RADV generates fluorescent and photoacoustic signals to guide near‐infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, which can induce localized ROS generation, not only to trigger prodrug activation and ultrafast drug release but also conduct photodynamic therapy in a spatiotemporally controlled manner.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in the development of radioresistance due to their functions in regulating the expression of target genes at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Exploring key lncRNAs and elucidating the mechanisms contributing to radioresistance are crucial for the development of effective strategies to reverse radioresistance, which however remains challenging. Here, actin filament‐associated protein 1 antisense RNA1 (lncAFAP1‐AS1) is identified as a key factor in inducing radioresistance of triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) via activating the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway. Considering the generation of a high concentration of reduction agent glutathione (GSH) under radiation, a reduction‐responsive nanoparticle (NP) platform is engineered for effective lncAFAP1‐AS1 siRNA (siAFAP1‐AS1) delivery. Systemic delivery of siAFAP1‐AS1 with the reduction‐responsive NPs can synergistically reverse radioresistance by silencing lncAFAP1‐AS1 expression and scavenging intracellular GSH, leading to a dramatically enhanced radiotherapy effect in both xenograft and metastatic TNBC tumor models. The findings indicate that lncAFAP1‐AS1 can be used to predict the outcome of TNBC radiotherapy and combination of systemic siAFAP1‐AS1 delivery with radiotherapy can be applied for the treatment of recurrent TNBC patients.",siAFAP1-AS1,15.555350553505534

Breast cancers have been categorized into four major molecular subtypes based on the immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression of classic hormone and growth factor receptors including the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), as well as a proliferation marker Ki-67 protein expression. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a breast cancer subtype lacking ER, PR, and HER2 expression, is associated with a high metastatic potential and poor prognosis. TNBC accounts for approximately only 15%–20% of new breast cancer diagnoses; it is responsible for most breast cancer–related deaths due to the lack of targeted treatment options for this patient population, and currently, systemic chemotherapy, radiation, and surgical excision remain the major treatment modalities for these patients with TNBC. Although breast cancer patients in general do not have a robust response to the immunotherapy, a subset of TNBC has been demonstrated to have high tumor mutation burden and high tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, resembling the features observed on melanoma or lung cancers, which can benefit from the treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Therefore, the immunogenic nature of this aggressive disease has presented an opportunity for the development of TNBC-targeting immunotherapies. The recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of atezolizumab in combination with the chemotherapeutic agent nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of PD-L1-positive unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic TNBC has led to a new era of immunotherapy in TNBC treatment.

Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) have been linked to cancer initiation, progression and chemotherapy resistance. Notch signaling is a key pathway regulating TNBC CSC survival. Treatment of TNBC with PI3K or mTORC1/2 inhibitors results in drug-resistant, Notch-dependent CSC. However, downstream mechanisms and potentially druggable Notch effectors in TNBC CSCs are largely unknown. We studied the role of the AKT pathway and mitochondrial metabolism downstream of Notch signaling in TNBC CSC from cell lines representative of different TNBC molecular subtypes as well as a novel patient-derived model. We demonstrate that exposure of TNBC cells to recombinant Notch ligand Jagged1 leads to rapid AKT phosphorylation in a Notch1-dependent but RBP-Jκ independent fashion. This requires mTOR and IKKα. Jagged1 also stimulates mitochondrial respiration and fermentation in an AKT- and IKK-dependent fashion. Notch1 co-localizes with mitochondria in TNBC cells. Pharmacological inhibition of Notch cleavage by gamma secretase inhibitor PF-03084014 in combination with AKT inhibitor MK-2206 or IKK-targeted NF-κB inhibitor Bay11-7082 blocks secondary mammosphere formation from sorted CD90hi or CD44+CD24low (CSCs) cells. A TNBC patient-derived model gave comparable results. Besides mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, Jagged1 also triggers nuclear, NF-κB-dependent transcription of anti-apoptotic gene cIAP-2. This requires recruitment of Notch1, IKKα and NF-κB to the cIAP-2 promoter. Our observations support a model where Jagged1 triggers IKKα-dependent, mitochondrial and nuclear Notch1 signals that stimulate AKT phosphorylation, oxidative metabolism and transcription of survival genes in PTEN wild-type TNBC cells. These data suggest that combination treatments targeting the intersection of the Notch, AKT and NF-κB pathways have potential therapeutic applications against CSCs in TNBC cases with Notch1 and wild-type PTEN expression.",MK-2206,15.555350553505534

Furthermore, the majority of deaths in breast cancer patients are from metastases instead of from primary tumors. In this study, MCF-7 (an estrogen receptor-positive human breast cancer cell line), MDA-MB-231 (a human TNBC cell line) and 4T1 (a mouse TNBC cell line) were used to investigate the anti-cancer effects of ionizing radiation (IR) combined with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC)) and to determine the underlying mechanisms of these effects in vitro and in vivo. We also evaluated the ability of SAHA to inhibit the metastasis of 4T1 cells. We found that IR combined with SAHA showed increased therapeutic efficacy when compared with either treatment alone in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells. Moreover, the combined treatment enhanced DNA damage through the inhibition of DNA repair proteins. The combined treatment was induced primarily through autophagy and ER stress. In an orthotopic breast cancer mouse model, the combination treatment showed a greater inhibition of tumor growth. In addition, SAHA inhibited the migration and invasion abilities of 4T1 cells and inhibited breast cancer cell migration by inhibiting the activity of MMP-9. In an in vivo experimental metastasis mouse model, SAHA significantly inhibited lung metastasis. SAHA not only enhances radiosensitivity but also suppresses lung metastasis in breast cancer. These novel findings suggest that SAHA alone or combined with IR could serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for breast cancer.",SAHA,15.055350553505534

Near infrared photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT) is a cancer treatment that employs an antibody-photosensitizer conjugate (APC) followed by exposure of NIR light for activating selective cytotoxicity on targeted cancer cells and may have application to TNBC. In order to minimize the dose of APC while maximizing the therapeutic effects, dosing of the APC and NIR light need to be optimized. In this study, we investigate in vitro and in vivo efficacy of cetuximab (cet)-IR700 NIR-PIT on two breast cancer models MDAMB231 (TNBC, EGFR moderate) and MDAMB468 (TNBC, EGFR high) cell lines, and demonstrate a method to optimize the dosing APC and NIR light. Method After validating in vitro cell-specific cytotoxicity, NIR-PIT therapeutic effects were investigated in mouse models using cell lines derived from TNBC tumors. Tumor-bearing mice were separated into 4 groups for the following treatments: (1) no treatment (control); (2) 300 μg of cet-IR700 i.v., (APC i.v. only); (3) NIR light exposure only, NIR light was administered at 50 J/cm2 on day 1 and 100 J/cm2 on day 2 (NIR light only); (4) 300 μg of cet-IR700 i.v., NIR light was administered at 50 J/cm2 on day 1 after injection and 100 J/cm2 of light on day 2 after injection (one shot NIR-PIT). To compare different treatment regimens with a fixed dose of APC, we added the following treatments (5) 100 μg of cet-IR700 i.v., NIR light administered at 50 J/cm2 on day 1 and 50 μg of cet-IR700 i.v. immediately after NIR-PIT, then NIR light was administered at 100 J/cm2 on day 2, which were performed two times every week (“two split” NIR-PIT) and (6) 100 μg of cet-IR700 i.v., NIR light was administered at 50 J/cm2 on day 1 and 100 J/cm2 on day 2, which were performed three times per week (“three split” NIR-PIT). Result Both specific binding and NIR-PIT effects were greater with MDAMB468 than MDAMB231 cells in vitro. Tumor accumulation of cet-IR700 in MDAMB468 tumors was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in MDAMB231 tumors in vivo. Tumor growth and survival of MDAMB231 tumor bearing mice was significantly lower in the NIR-PIT treatment group (p < 0.05). In MDAMB468 bearing mice, tumor growth and survival was significantly improved in the NIR-PIT treatment groups in all treatment regimens (one shot NIR-PIT; p < 0.05, “two split” NIR-PIT; p < 0.01, “three split” NIR-PIT; p < 0.001) compared with control groups. Conclusion NIR-PIT for TNBC was effective regardless of expression of EGFR, however, greater cell killing was shown with higher EGFR expression tumor in vitro. In all treatment regimens, NIR-PIT suppressed tumor growth, resulting in significantly prolonged survival that further improved by splitting the APC dose and using repeated light exposures.",cetuximab,15.055350553505534

It comprises approximately 15-20% of breast cancers (BCs). Unfortunately, TNBC's treatment continues to be a clinical problem because of its relatively poor prognosis, its aggressiveness and the lack of targeted therapies, leaving chemotherapy as the mainstay of treatment. It is essential to find new therapies against TNBC, in order to surpass the resistance and the invasiveness of already existing therapies. Given the fact that epigenetic processes control both the initiation and progression of TNBC, there is an increasing interest in the mechanisms, molecules and signaling pathways that participate at the epigenetic modulation of genes expressed in carcinogenesis. The acetylation of histone proteins provokes the transcription of genes involved in cell growth, and the expression of histone deacetylases (HDACs) is frequently up-regulated in many malignancies. Unfortunately, in the field of BC, HDAC inhibitors have shown limited effect as single agents. Nevertheless, their use in combination with kinase inhibitors, autophagy inhibitors, ionizing radiation, or two HDAC inhibitors together is currently being evaluated. HDAC inhibitors such as suberoylanilidehydroxamic acid (SAHA), sodium butyrate, mocetinostat, panobinostat, entinostat, YCW1 and N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propylpentanamide have shown promising therapeutic outcomes against TNBC, especially when they are used in combination with other anticancer agents. More studies concerning HDAC inhibitors in breast carcinomas along with a more accurate understanding of the TNBC's pathobiology are required for the possible identification of new therapeutic strategies.",HDAC,15.055350553505534

Chemotherapy is the main therapeutic strategy for such patients with breast cancer, although the outcome is often unsatisfactory. Thus, the development of combination adjuvant therapies is essential for improved prognosis in patients with TNBC. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of a sequential combination of cytokine-induced killer cell (CIK) infusion and chemotherapy for patients with post-mastectomy TNBC. Experimental Design: From 2008 to 2012, 90 patients with post-mastectomy TNBC were included in this retrospective study: 45 cases received chemotherapy alone or with sequential radiotherapy; a further 45 cases received chemotherapy with/without radiotherapy and sequential CIK infusion. Results: Survival analysis showed significantly higher disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates in the CIK treatment group compared with the control group (P = 0.0382, P = 0.0046, respectively; log-rank test). Multivariate survival analysis showed that CIK adjuvant treatment was an independent prognostic factor for OS of patients with TNBC. In subgroup analyses, CIK adjuvant treatment significantly increased the DFS rate of patients with pathologic grade 3, and significantly increased the OS rate of patients in N1, N2, N3, IIB, III TNM (tumor–node–metastasis) stages, and with pathologic grade 3. Conclusions: These data indicate that adjuvant CIK treatment combined with chemotherapy is an effective therapeutic strategy to prevent disease recurrence and prolong survival of patients with TNBC, particularly those with lymph node metastasis, advanced TNM stage, and poor pathologic grade.

Furthermore, TNBCs are relatively more prevalent among African-American women and can account for some of the health disparities associated with breast cancer. We approached a molecular understanding of how TNBC differs from ER(+) breast cancer through a comprehensive gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography (LC)/MS/MS-based and unbiased metabolomic analysis of a series of breast carcinomas from African-American patients. Remarkably, global metabolomic profiling of tumor tissues identified a total of 418 distinct metabolites, out of which 133 (31.8%) were shown to differ between the ER(+) and TNBC tumors with statistical probability of p<0.05. Specific biochemical pathways affected included those reflecting general increases in energy metabolism and transmethylation in the TNBC tumors when compared to ER(+) tumors. Additionally, biochemicals associated with increased proliferation, redox balance and the recently proposed oncometabolites, sarcosine and 2-hydroxyglutarate, were also detected at higher levels in the TNBC versus ER(+) tumors. These studies demonstrate that TNBC tumors have metabolic signatures that distinguish them from ER(+) tumors and suggest that distinctive metabolic characteristics of these tumors might offer new targets for treatment.",sarcosine,14.555350553505534

Taxane and anthracycline-containing chemotherapy (CT) is currently the main systemic treatment option for TNBC, while platinum-based chemotherapy showed promising results in the neoadjuvant and metastatic settings. An early arising of intrinsic or acquired CT resistance is common and represents the main hurdle for successful TNBC treatment. Numerous mechanisms were uncovered that can lead to the development of chemoresistance. These include cancer stem cells (CSCs) induction after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, hypoxia and avoidance of apoptosis, single factors such as tyrosine kinase receptors (EGFR, IGFR1), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10), and a few pathological molecular pathways. Some biomarkers capable of predicting resistance to specific chemotherapeutic agents were identified and are expected to be validated in future studies for a more accurate selection of drugs to be employed and for a more tailored approach, both in neoadjuvant and advanced settings. Recently, based on specific biomarkers, some therapies were tailored to TNBC subsets and became available in clinical practice: olaparib and talazoparib for BRCA1/2 germline mutation carriers larotrectinib and entrectinib for neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusion carriers, and anti-trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (Trop2) antibody drug conjugate therapy for heavily pretreated metastatic TNBC (mTNBC). Further therapies targeting some pathologic molecular pathways, apoptosis, miRNAS, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), and androgen receptor (AR) are under investigation. Among them, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and EGFR inhibitors as well as antiandrogens showed promising results and are under evaluation in Phase II/III clinical trials.

Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)-causing alterations have been reported in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We hypothesized that TNBCs with HRD alterations might be more sensitive to anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy and report on HRD status and BRCA1 promoter methylation (PM) as prognostic markers in TNBC patients treated with adjuvant doxorubicin (A) and cyclophosphamide (C) in SWOG9313.


Patients and methods
In total, 425 TNBC patients were identified from S9313. HRD score, tumor BRCA1/2 sequencing, and BRCA1 PM were carried out on DNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. Positive HRD status was defined as either a deleterious tumor BRCA1/2 (tBRCA) mutation or a pre-defined HRD score ≥42. Markers were tested for prognostic value on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) using Cox regression models adjusted for treatment assignment and nodal status.


Results
HRD status was determined in 89% (379/425) of cases. Of these, 67% were HRD positive (27% with tBRCA mutation, 40% tBRCA-negative but HRD score ≥42). HRD-positive status was associated with a better DFS [hazard ratio (HR) 0.72; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-1.00; P = 0.049] and non-significant trend toward better OS (HR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.48-1.03; P = 0.073). High HRD score (≥42) in tBRCA-negative patients (n = 274) was also associated with better DFS (HR = 0.64; 95% CI 0.43-0.94; P = 0.023) and OS (HR = 0.65; 95% CI 0.42-1.00; P = 0.049). BRCA1 PM was evaluated successfully in 82% (348/425) and detected in 32% of cases. The DFS HR for BRCA1 PM was similar to that for HRD but did not reach statistical significance (HR = 0.79; 95% CI 0.54-1.17; P = 0.25).


Conclusions
HRD positivity was observed in two-thirds of TNBC patients receiving adjuvant AC and was associated with better DFS. HRD status may identify TNBC patients who receive greater benefit from AC-based chemotherapy and should be evaluated further in prospective studies.

In this study, we examined the utility of [18F](2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine ([18F]4F-Gln) PET to measure tumor cellular glutamine pool size, whose change might reveal the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of drugs targeting this cancer-specific metabolic pathway. High glutaminase (GLS) activity in TNBC tumors resulted in low cellular glutamine pool size assayed via high-resolution 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). GLS inhibition significantly increased glutamine pool size in TNBC tumors. MCF-7 tumors, with inherently low GLS activity compared with TNBC, displayed a larger baseline glutamine pool size that did not change as much in response to GLS inhibition. The tumor-to-blood-activity ratios (T/B) obtained from [18F]4F-Gln PET images matched the distinct glutamine pool sizes of both tumor models at baseline. After a short course of GLS inhibitor treatment, the T/B values increased significantly in TNBC, but did not change in MCF-7 tumors. Across both tumor types and after GLS inhibitor or vehicle treatment, we observed a strong positive correlation between T/B values and tumor glutamine pool size measured using MRS (r2 = 0.71). In conclusion, [18F]4F-Gln PET tracked cellular glutamine pool size in breast cancers with differential GLS activity and detected increases in cellular glutamine pool size induced by GLS inhibitors.

This study aims to examine the cytotoxic effects of CD and investigate the underlying mechanism in human TNBC cells. The results show that CD exhibits cytotoxicity by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in TNBC cells via modulation of Bcl-2, Bax, cyt-C, cleaved caspase-3, and PARP. We find that CD significantly increases expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin, while reciprocally decreasing expression of mesenchymal markers such as snail, slug, and vimentin in BT-549 cells. In parallel with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) reversal, CD down regulates invasion and migration of BT-549 cells. CD markedly reduces stability and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, accompanied with downregulation of β-catenin target genes. Using the TopFlash luciferase reporter assay, we reveal CD as a specific inhibitor of the Wnt3a-induced signaling. These results suggest the involvement of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the CD-induced EMT reversion of BT-549 cells. Notably, CD restores the glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) activity, required for β-catenin destruction via the proteasome-mediated system, by inhibiting the phosphorylation of GSK3β by Akt. These occurrences ultimately lead to the blockage of EMT and the invasion of TNBC cells. Further antitumor activity of CD was tested in 4T1 (TNBC cells) induced tumor and it was found that CD significantly inhibited the tumor volume at dose of 5 mg/kg-treated mice. © 2016 BioFactors, 43(2):152-169, 2017.",Cardamonin,13.055350553505534

However, clinical trials using these 2 strategies have not reached their promise. In this study, we used EGFR as a target for radioimmunotherapy and hypothesized that EGFR-directed radioimmunotherapy can deliver a continuous lethal radiation dose to residual tumors that are radiosensitized by PARP inhibitors and chemotherapy. Methods: We analyzed EGFR messenger RNA in published gene expression array studies and investigated EGFR protein expression by immunohistochemistry in a cohort of breast cancer patients to confirm EGFR as a target in TNBC. Preclinically, using orthotopic and metastatic xenograft models of EGFR-positive TNBC, we investigated the effect of the novel combination of 177Lu-labeled anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, chemotherapy, and PARP inhibitors on cell death and the survival of breast cancer stem cells. Results: In this first preclinical study of anti-EGFR radioimmunotherapy in breast cancer, we found that anti-EGFR radioimmunotherapy is safe and that TNBC orthotopic tumors and established metastases were eradicated in mice treated with anti-EGFR radioimmunotherapy combined with chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors. We showed that the superior response to this triple-agent combination therapy was associated with apoptosis and eradication of putative breast cancer stem cells.

However, the current chemotherapeutic drugs have limited effects on TNBC, and often lead to serious side effects as well as drug resistance. Thus, more effective therapeutic options are sorely needed. As c-MYC oncogene is highly expressed during TNBC pathogenesis, inhibiting c-MYC expression would be an alternative anti-TNBC strategy. In this study, we designed and synthesized a serial of quinoxaline analogs that target c-MYC promoter G-quadruplex (G4), which is believed to be a repressor of c-MYC transcription. Among them, a difluoro-substituted quinoxaline QN-1 was identified as the most promising G4-stabilizing ligand with high selectivity to c-MYC G4 over other G4s, which is distinguished from many other reported ligands. Intracellular studies indicated that QN-1 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, repressed metastasis and inhibited TNBC cell growth, primarily due to the downregulation of c-MYC transcription by a G4-dependent mechanism. Notably, inhibition by QN-1 was significantly greater for c-MYC than other G4-driven genes. Cancer cells with c-MYC overexpression were more sensitive to QN-1, relative to normal cells. Furthermore, QN-1 effectively suppressed tumor growth in a TNBC mouse model. Accordingly, this work provides an alternative strategy for treating TNBC.",QN-1,13.055350553505534

In this study, we investigated the effect of fisetin on triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. TNBC has a poorer prognosis than other types of breast cancer and treatment options for this disease are limited. Fisetin inhibited the growth of MDA‐MB‐468 and MDA‐MB‐231 TNBC cells, as well as their ability to form colonies, without substantially affecting the growth of non‐malignant cells. In addition, fisetin inhibited the growth of estrogen receptor‐bearing MCF‐7 breast cancer cells and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2‐overexpressing SK‐BR‐3 breast cancer cells. Fisetin inhibited TNBC cell division and induced apoptosis, which was associated with mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and the activation of caspase‐9 and caspase‐8, as well as the cleavage of poly(ADP‐ribose) polymerase‐1. Induction of caspase‐dependent apoptosis by fisetin was confirmed by reduced killing of TNBC cells in the presence of the pan‐caspase inhibitors Z‐VAD‐FMK and BOC‐D‐FMK. Decreased phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 in fisetin‐treated TNBC cells at G2/M phase of the cell cycle suggested that fisetin‐induced apoptosis was the result of Aurora B kinase inhibition. Interestingly, the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin, 5‐fluorouracil, and 4‐hydroxycyclophosphamide metabolite of cyclophosphamide on TNBC cells was increased in the presence of fisetin.

We report the development of a new ap-tamer-drug conjugate (ApDC), AS1411-triptolide conjugate (ATC), as targeted therapy for the treatment of TNBC with high efficacy. The coupling of triptolide with aptamer conferred it with excellent specificity and significantly increased cytotoxicity against the MDA-MB-231 cell line.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) refers to any breast cancer that does not express ER, PR, and HER2.1 Studies have shown it accounts for about 15-20% of all breast cancer cases.2 TNBC is much easier to spread to other healthy organs and more likely to relapse after treatment than the other breast cancer types, it thus has been considered to be the most malignant subtype of breast cancer.3 Currently, the treatment of TNBC usually relies on a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. It is of interest that TNBC tumors respond well to chemotherapy compared with other subtypes, however, the lack of ER, PR, and HER2 makes it more difficult to apply commonly used targeted cancer therapy approach-es such as endocrine therapy.

During the last two decades, the use of targeted therapies has emerged in clinical research in order to increase treatment efficiency, improve prognosis and reduce recurrence. However, the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype remains a clinical challenge, with poor prognosis since no therapeutic targets have been identified. This aggressive breast cancer entity lacks expression of oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), and it does not overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The major reason for TNBC poor prognosis is early therapeutic escape from conventional treatments, leading to aggressive metastatic relapse. Metastases occur after an epithelial-mesenchymal transition EMT of epithelial cells, allowing them to break free from the primary tumour site and to colonize distant organs. Cancer-associated EMT consists not only of acquired migration and invasion ability, but involves complex and comprehensive reprogramming, including changes in metabolism, expression levels and epigenetic. Recently, many studies have considered epigenetic alterations as the primary initiator of cancer development and metastasis. This review builds a picture of the epigenetic modifications implicated in the EMT of breast cancer. It focuses on TNBC and allows comparisons with other subtypes. It emphasizes the role of the main epigenetic modifications lncRNAs, miRNAs, histone and DNA- modifications in tumour invasion and appearance of metastases.

To investigate parameters based on fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging that are best correlated with pathologic complete response (PCR) in human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-positive cancer and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and with partial or complete response in ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was approved by institutional review board with waivers of informed written consent and included consecutive patients treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Five PET examination-derived parameters were tested: standard uptake value (SUV) maximum (SUV(max)), peak (SUV(peak)), and mean (SUV(mean)), metabolically active tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis (TLG). Absolute values at baseline PET, at PET imaging after two cycles of chemotherapy, and variation (ie, change) were measured. Correlations with pathologic response (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) and predictive power assessed (area under the curve [AUC] on the basis of receiver operating characteristic analysis) were examined.


RESULTS
Included were 169 consecutive patients (mean age, 50 years). PCR was more frequent in HER2-positive tumors (16 of 33 patients [48.5%]) and TNBCs (20 of 54 patients [37%]) than in ER positive/HER2-negative tumors (four of 82 [4.9%]) (P < .001). Among patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative cancers, 33 patients had partial response. In TNBC, best association with PCR was obtained with change in SUV(max) (AUC, 0.86) or change in TLG (AUC, 0.88). In HER2-positive phenotype, absolute SUV(max) (or SUV(peak)) values at PET imaging after two cycles of chemotherapy (AUC for each cycle, 0.93) were better correlated with PCR than change in SUV(max) (AUC, 0.78; P = .11) or change in TLG (AUC, 0.62; P = .005). Regarding ER-positive/HER2-negative cancers, change in SUV(max) or change in TLG (AUC, 0.75) were parameters best correlated with partial or complete response. Baseline SUV(max) was higher in lymph nodes than in primary tumor in 31 patients. Findings were similar considering the site with highest FDG uptake.


CONCLUSION
Quantitative indexes of tumor glucose use that are best correlated with pathologic response vary by phenotype: change in SUV(max) or TLG are most adequate for TNBCs and ER-positive/ HER2-negative cancers and absolute SUV(max) after two cycles of chemotherapy for HER2-positive breast cancers.",chemotherapy,12.055350553505534

However, its utility as a therapeutic target in this subtype of breast cancer is poorly understood. To evaluate MET fully as a potential therapeutic target for TNBC/BLBC, we investigated the relationship between MET expression and clinical outcomes of patients with breast cancer and the functional effect of MET inhibition. Using automated immunohistochemistry (Ventana), we analyzed MET expression in 924 breast cancer patients with relevant clinicopathologic parameters. BLBC showed the strongest relationship with MET expression (57.5%, p < 0.001). High expression of MET in breast cancer resulted in poor overall survival (p = 0.001) and disease‐free survival (DFS, p = 0.010). MET expression was relatively high in TNBC cell lines, and the silencing of MET via small interfering RNA reduced cell proliferation and migration. We observed reduced TNBC cell viability after treatment with the MET inhibitor PHA‐665752. In the most drug‐resistant cell line, MDA‐MB‐468, which showed elevated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression, silencing of EGFR resulted in increased sensitivity to PHA‐665752 treatment. We confirmed that PHA‐665752 synergizes with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib to decrease the viability of MDA‐MB‐468 cells. TNBC patients coexpressing MET and EGFR showed significantly worse DFS than that in patients expressing EGFR alone (p = 0.021). Our findings strongly suggest that MET may be a therapeutic target in TNBC and that the combined therapy targeting MET and EGFR may be beneficial for the treatment of TNBC/BLBC patients.",PHA-665752,11.555350553505534

Patients diagnosed with TNBC, compared to those diagnosed with other breast cancer subtypes, have relatively poor outcomes due to high tumor aggressiveness and lack of targeted treatment. Metabolic reprogramming, an emerging hallmark of cancer, is hijacked by TNBC to fulfill bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands; maintain the redox balance; and further promote oncogenic signaling, cell proliferation, and metastasis. Understanding the mechanisms of metabolic remodeling may guide the design of metabolic strategies for the effective intervention of TNBC.

We reviewed this concept considering recent results in the field. Areas covered Herein, the authors cover neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without biologics in triple-negative and HER2-positive operable breast cancer with a focus on rates of complete pathological remission (pCR) in the breast and axilla. The impact of the CREATE X and KATERINE randomized clinical trials of post-surgical treatments in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is also discussed. Expert opinion The CREATE X and KATERINE clinical trials show for the first time and with methodological strengths that, in TNBC and HER2-positive breast cancer patients, post-surgical capecitabine and T-DM1, respectively, can improve prognosis when the disease persists after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, the role of pCR as a treatment endpoint and a guide for further treatment decisions is now demonstrated. On account of these results, neoadjuvant chemotherapy becomes not an option, but rather the preferred treatment strategy for more and more TNBC and HER2-positive breast cancer patients in clinical practice.",capecitabine,11.555350553505534

Because of the lack of therapeutic targets and limited treatment options, the prognosis for patients with TNBC remains the poorest of all patients with breast cancer. Here we report the synthesis and application of a novel CRISPR nanotherapeutic to effectively knock out Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), a breast cancer-promoting gene, in TNBC tumors via in vivo genome editing, leading to a significant suppression of TNBC tumor growth. Our studies demonstrate that CRISPR genome editing is a promising targeted gene therapy approach for TNBC. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which has the highest mortality rate of all breast cancer, is in urgent need of a therapeutic that hinders the spread and growth of cancer cells. CRISPR genome editing holds the promise of a potential cure for many genetic diseases, including TNBC; however, its clinical translation is being challenged by the lack of safe and effective nonviral delivery systems for in vivo therapeutic genome editing. Here we report the synthesis and application of a noncationic, deformable, and tumor-targeted nanolipogel system (tNLG) for CRISPR genome editing in TNBC tumors. We have demonstrated that tNLGs mediate a potent CRISPR knockout of Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), a known breast cancer oncogene, in human TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo. The loss of Lcn2 significantly inhibits the migration and the mesenchymal phenotype of human TNBC cells and subsequently attenuates TNBC aggressiveness. In an orthotopic TNBC model, we have shown that systemically administered tNLGs mediated >81% CRISPR knockout of Lcn2 in TNBC tumor tissues, resulting in significant tumor growth suppression (>77%). Our proof-of-principle results provide experimental evidence that tNLGs can be used as a safe, precise, and effective delivery approach for in vivo CRISPR genome editing in TNBC.",CRISPR,11.055350553505534

Androgen receptor (AR) is one of newly emerging biomarker in TNBC. In recent years, ARs have been demonstrated to play an important role in the genesis and in the development of breast cancer, although their prognostic role is still debated. In the present study, we explored the correlation of AR expression with clinical, pathological and molecular features and its impact on prognosis in early TNBC. Patients and Methods: ARs were considered positive in case of tumors with >10% nuclear-stained. Survival distribution was estimated by the Kaplan Meier method. The univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. The difference among variables were calculated by chi-square test. Results: 81 TNBC patients diagnosed between January 2006 and December 2011 were included in the analysis. Slides were stained immunohistochemically for estrogen and progesterone receptors, HER-2, Ki-67, ALDH1, e-cadherin and AR. Of the 81 TNBC samples, 18.8% showed positive immunostaining for AR, 23.5% and 44.4% of patients were negative for e-cadherin and ALDH1, respectively. Positive AR immunostaining was inversely correlated with a higher Ki-67 (p < 0.0001) and a lympho-vascular invasion (p = 0.01), but no other variables. Univariate survival analysis revealed that AR expression was not associated with disease-free survival (p = 0.72) or overall survival (p = 0.93). Conclusions: The expression of AR is associated with some biological features of TNBC, such as Ki-67 and lympho-vascular invasion; nevertheless the prognostic significance of AR was not documented in our analysis.

Doxorubicin is considered to be one of the most effective agents in the treatment of TNBC. Unfortunately, resistance to this agent is common. In some drug-resistant cells, drug efflux is mediated by adenosine triphosphate-dependent membrane transporter termed adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, which can drive the substrates across membranes against concentration gradient. In the tumor microenvironment, upon interaction with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), tumor cells exhibit altered biological functions of certain gene clusters, hence increasing stemness of tumor cells, migration ability, angiogenesis, and drug resistance. In our present study, we investigated the mechanism of TNBC drug resistance induced by adipose-derived MSCs. Upon exposure of TNBC to MSC-secreted conditioned medium (CM), noticeable drug resistance against doxorubicin with markedly increased BCRP protein expression was observed. Intracellular doxorubicin accumulation of TNBC was also decreased by MSC-secreted CM. Furthermore, we found that doxorubicin resistance of TNBC was mediated by IL-8 presented in the MSC-secreted CM. These findings may enrich the list of potential targets for overcoming drug resistance induced by MSCs in TNBC patients.",doxorubicin,10.555350553505534

Its treatment has been challenging due to its heterogeneity and absence of well-defined molecular targets. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify novel agents with therapeutic application. NF-κB is over-expressed in many breast cancers; thus, inactivation of the NF-κB pathway could serve as a therapeutic target. Here we report for the first time the anti-tumor activity of panepoxydone (PP), a NF-κB inhibitor isolated from an edible mushroom, in several breast cancer cell lines. Methods We investigated the effects of PP on cell growth, migration-invasion, apoptosis and EMT-related proteins expression in MCF-7 and TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-453. Results Significant antitumor activity was seen in all cell lines, with differential responses noted in cell-line specific manner. Treatment with PP resulted in significant cytotoxicity, decreased invasion, migration and increased apoptosis in all cell lines tested. Up-regulation of Bax and cleaved PARP and down-regulation of Bcl-2, survivin, cyclin D1 and caspase 3 were noted in PP-treated breast cancer cells. The antitumor effect of PP appeared related to its ability to inhibit the phosphorylation of inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBα) with cytoplasmic accumulation. PP treatment also down-regulated FOXM1 which resulted in a reversal of EMT. Similar results were obtained after silencing of NF-kB and FOXM1. Conclusion Altogether, these studies show, for the first time the antitumor activity of PP against breast cancer cells, in particular TNBC cells. Furthermore, it highlights the concept that optimal treatment of TNBC warrants attention to the differential sensitivity of various TNBC subtypes to therapeutic agents. These results suggest that the PP may be a potentially effective chemopreventive or therapeutic agent against breast cancer. However, additional studies are required to more fully elucidate the mechanism of antitumor effect of PP.",panepoxydone,10.555350553505534

In TNBC patients with Aur-A high expression, the risk of distant recurrence peaked at the first 3 years and declined rapidly thereafter, whereas patients with Aur-A low expression showed a relatively constant risk of recurrence during the entire follow-up period. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that overexpression of Aur-A predicted poor overall survival (P = 0.002) and progression-free survival (P = 0.012) in TNBC. Furthermore, overexpression of Aur-A, associated with high Ki-67, predicted an inferior prognosis compared with low expression of both Aur-A and Ki-67. Importantly, we further found that Aur-A was overexpressed in TNBC cells, and inhibition of this kinase inhibited cell proliferation and prevented cell migration in TNBC. Our findings demonstrated that Aur-A was a potential therapeutic target for TNBC and inhibition of Aur-A kinase was a promising regimen for TNBC cancer therapy.",Aurora-A,10.055350553505534

Until now, clinical trials for TNBCs using EGFR inhibitors (EGFRis) as single agents have yielded disappointing results. Here, we report that combinatorial treatment using EGFRis, such as gefitinib or erlotinib, with PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors (PI3K/AKTis) demonstrated a synergistic, anti‐proliferative effect in cell lines of the basal‐like (BL) subtype, a subtype of TNBC. Western blot analysis revealed that the gefitinib/PI‐103 combination significantly reduced the level of both phospho‐AKT and phospho‐ERK in two susceptible BL subtype cell lines, SUM149PT and MDA‐MB‐468, whereas it had little or no effect on the level of phospho‐ERK in two non‐susceptible cell lines (HS578T and MDA‐MB‐231) of mesenchymal stem‐like (MSL) TNBC subtype. The gefitinib/PI‐103 combination also significantly induced caspase‐3/7‐mediated PARP cleavage and reduced two anti‐apoptotic proteins, XIAP and Bcl‐2 in the susceptible cell lines. In addition, the level of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl‐1) protein was markedly decreased by gefitinib/PI‐103 combination in the BL TNBC cells, but showed no significant change by this combination in MSL subtype cells. These results suggest that pharmacological inhibition of EGFR used in combination of PI3K/AKTis is a potential therapeutic approach to treat a subtype of TNBCs.",gefitinib,10.055350553505534

Preclinical models support the use of platinum agents in the TNBC basal subtype. The EA1131 trial hypothesized that invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) would not be inferior but improved in patients with basal subtype TNBC treated with adjuvant platinum compared with capecitabine. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with clinical stage II or III TNBC with ≥ 1 cm RD in the breast post-NAC were randomly assigned to receive platinum (carboplatin or cisplatin) once every 3 weeks for four cycles or capecitabine 14 out of 21 days every 3 weeks for six cycles. TNBC subtype (basal v nonbasal) was determined by PAM50 in the residual disease. A noninferiority design with superiority alternative was chosen, assuming a 4-year iDFS of 67% with capecitabine. RESULTS Four hundred ten of planned 775 participants were randomly assigned to platinum or capecitabine between 2015 and 2021. After median follow-up of 20 months and 120 iDFS events (61% of full information) in the 308 (78%) patients with basal subtype TNBC, the 3-year iDFS for platinum was 42% (95% CI, 30 to 53) versus 49% (95% CI, 39 to 59) for capecitabine. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were more common with platinum agents. The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee recommended stopping the trial as it was unlikely that further follow-up would show noninferiority or superiority of platinum. CONCLUSION Platinum agents do not improve outcomes in patients with basal subtype TNBC RD post-NAC and are associated with more severe toxicity when compared with capecitabine. Participants had a lower than expected 3-year iDFS regardless of study treatment, highlighting the need for better therapies in this high-risk population.",capecitabine,9.055350553505534

Here, we report evidence highlighting the cell-cycle-related kinase CDK7 as a driver and candidate therapeutic target in TNBC. Using publicly available transcriptomic data from a collated set of TNBC patients (n = 383) and the METABRIC TNBC dataset (n = 217), we found CDK7 mRNA levels to be correlated with patient prognosis. High CDK7 protein expression was associated with poor prognosis within the RATHER TNBC cohort (n = 109) and the METABRIC TNBC cohort (n = 203). The highly specific CDK7 kinase inhibitors, BS-181 and THZ1, each downregulated CDK7-mediated phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II, indicative of transcriptional inhibition, with THZ1 exhibiting 500-fold greater potency than BS-181. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the survival of MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells relied heavily on the BCL-2/BCL-XL signaling axes in cells. Accordingly, we found that combining the BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitors ABT-263/ABT199 with the CDK7 inhibitor THZ1 synergized in producing growth inhibition and apoptosis of human TNBC cells. Collectively, our results highlight elevated CDK7 expression as a candidate biomarker of poor prognosis in TNBC, and they offer a preclinical proof of concept for combining CDK7 and BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitors as a mechanism-based therapeutic strategy to improve TNBC treatment.

To modulate BRCA1 expression, we tested two different dietary components to find out if any would induce tumor suppressor genes. We detected that quercetin and curcumin dose‐dependently enhanced the BRCA1 expression. Further, a synergistic action of quercetin and curcumin was observed in modulating the BRCA1 level and in inhibiting the cell survival and migration of TNBC cell lines. Quercetin and curcumin appeared to induce BRCA1 promoter histone acetylation. Furthermore, BRCA1 knockdown induced cell survival and cell migration in ER + cells were significantly decreased by the combined treatment of quercetin and curcumin.

Although diallyl disulfide (DADS), an important garlic (Allium sativum) derivative, has exhibited potential anticancer activity, the molecular mechanism of this activity remains unknown. In this study, we evaluated the antitumor activity of DADS in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines based in vitro and in vivo models.


METHODS AND RESULTS
We found that treatment with DADS resulted in decreased viability, increased apoptosis, and suppression of metastatic potential in TNBC cells. Furthermore, DADS induced dysregulation of B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 family members, downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and reversal of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Interestingly, DADS significantly inhibited activation of the β-catenin signaling pathway, which regulated Bcl-2 family members, MMP-9 and EMT in TNBC cells. Consistent with these in vitro findings, we also verified the anticancer potential of DADS in MDA-MB-231 xenograft mice. Treatment with DADS significantly reduced tumor volume and weight and increased apoptosis in these mice, while the expression of active β-catenin was decreased, and the downstream molecules were dysregulated.


CONCLUSION
Our results show that the antitumor effect of DADS on TNBC cells is mediated by the β-catenin pathway, suggesting that DADS could be used as a potential therapeutic agent for treating or preventing breast cancer.",diallyl-disulfide,8.055350553505534

To identify novel targets for TNBC, we evaluated phosphatase expression in breast tumors and characterized their contributions to in vitro and in vivo growth of TNBC. Using Affymetrix microarray analysis of 102 breast cancers, we identified 146 phosphatases that were significantly differentially expressed in TNBC compared with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors. Of these, 19 phosphatases were upregulated (0.66-fold; FDR = 0.05) in TNBC compared with ER-positive breast cancers. We knocked down 17 overexpressed phosphatases in four triple-negative and four ER-positive breast cancer lines using specific siRNAs and found that depletion of six of these phosphatases significantly reduced growth and anchorage-independent growth of TNBC cells to a greater extent than ER-positive cell lines. Further analysis of the phosphatase PTP4A3 (also known as PRL-3) demonstrated its requirement for G1-S cell-cycle progression in all breast cancer cells, but PTP4A3 regulated apoptosis selectively in TNBC cells. In addition, PTP4A3 inhibition reduced the growth of TNBC tumors in vivo Moreover, in silico analysis revealed the PTP4A3 gene to be amplified in 29% of basal-like breast cancers, and high expression of PTP4A3 could serve as an independent prognostic indicator for worse overall survival. Collectively, these studies define the importance of phosphatase overexpression in TNBC and lay the foundation for the development of new targeted therapies directed against phosphatases or their respective signaling pathways for TNBC patients.

Recent studies have demonstrated that this drug resistance is associated with a group of cells known as cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are believed to determine the sensitivity of tumor cells to cancer treatment. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that play significant roles in normal and cancer cells. MiR-223 reportedly acts as a tumor suppressor in a range of cancers. However, the role of miR-223 in TNBC, especially in triple-negative breast cancer stem cells (TNBCSCs), remains unknown. Here, we found that miR-223 expression was down-regulated in CD44+CD24-/low TNBCSCs compared with non-CSCs. Furthermore, we found that miR-223 overexpression resensitized TNBCSCs to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis. The HAX-1 gene, which is located in the mitochondria and functions as an anti-apoptotic protein, was found to be directly regulated by miR-223 in MDA-MB-231 cells. We demonstrated that miR-223 overexpression promoted TRAIL-induced apoptosis through the mitochondria/ROS pathway. In conclusion, our results suggest that miR-223 increases the sensitivity of TNBCSCs to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by targeting HAX-1. Our findings have improved our understanding of the role of miR-223 in TNBC and may contribute to TNBC treatment.",TRAIL,7.555350553505534

The retinoblastoma (RB1) tumor suppressor is frequently lost in human TNBC. Knockdown of RB1 in luminal BC cells was shown to affect response to endocrine, radiation and several antineoplastic drugs. However, the effect of RB1 status on radiation and chemo-sensitivity in TNBC cells and whether RB1 status affects response to divergent or specific treatment are unknown. Using multiple basal-like and claudin-low cell lines, we hereby demonstrate that RB-negative TNBC cell lines are highly sensitive to gamma-irradiation, and moderately more sensitive to doxorubicin and methotrexate compared to RB-positive TNBC cell lines. In contrast, RB1 status did not affect sensitivity of TNBC cells to multiple other drugs including cisplatin (CDDP), 5-fluorouracil, idarubicin, epirubicin, PRIMA-1met, fludarabine and PD-0332991, some of which are used to treat TNBC patients. Moreover, a non-biased screen of ∼3400 compounds, including FDA-approved drugs, revealed similar sensitivity of RB-proficient and -deficient TNBC cells. Finally, ESA+/CD24−/low/CD44+ cancer stem cells from RB-negative TNBC lines were consistently more sensitive to gamma-irradiation than RB-positive lines, whereas the effect of chemotherapy on the cancer stem cell fraction varied irrespective of RB1 expression.

The inability of anticancer agents to cross the blood-brain-barrier represents a critical challenge for successful treatment. In the current study, we investigated the antimetastatic potential of penfluridol, an antipsychotic drug frequently prescribed for schizophrenia with anticancer activity. We show that penfluridol induced apoptosis and reduced the survival of several metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines. In addition, penfluridol treatment significantly reduced the expression of integrin α6, integrin β4, Fak, paxillin, Rac1/2/3, and ROCK1 in vitro. We further evaluated the efficacy of penfluridol in three different in vivo tumor models. We demonstrate that penfluridol administration to an orthotopic model of breast cancer suppressed tumor growth by 49%. On the other hand, penfluridol treatment inhibited the growth of metastatic brain tumors introduced by intracardiac or intracranial injection of breast cancer cells by 90% and 72%, respectively. Penfluridol-treated tumors from all three models exhibited reduced integrin β4 and increased apoptosis. Moreover, chronic administration of penfluridol failed to elicit significant toxic or behavioral side effects in mice.

However, the response rate of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 is still unsatisfactory, partly due to immunosuppressive factors such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β). In our previous pilot study, the bispecific antibody targeting TGF-β and murine PD-L1 (termed YM101) showed potent antitumor effect. In this work, we constructed a bispecific antibody targeting TGF-β and human PD-L1 (termed BiTP) and explored the antitumor effect of BiTP in TNBC. Methods BiTP was developed using Check-BODYTM bispecific platform. The binding affinity of BiTP was measured by surface plasmon resonance, ELISA, and flow cytometry. The bioactivity was assessed by Smad and NFAT luciferase reporter assays, immunofluorescence, western blotting, and superantigen stimulation assays. The antitumor activity of BiTP was explored in humanized epithelial-mesenchymal transition-6-hPDL1 and 4T1-hPDL1 murine TNBC models. Immunohistochemical staining, flow cytometry, and bulk RNA-seq were used to investigate the effect of BiTP on immune cell infiltration. Results BiTP exhibited high binding affinity to dual targets. In vitro experiments verified that BiTP effectively counteracted TGF-β-Smad and PD-L1-PD-1-NFAT signaling. In vivo animal experiments demonstrated that BiTP had superior antitumor activity relative to anti-PD-L1 and anti-TGF-β monotherapy. Mechanistically, BiTP decreased collagen deposition, enhanced CD8+ T cell penetration, and increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. This improved tumor microenvironment contributed to the potent antitumor activity of BiTP. Conclusion BiTP retains parent antibodies’ binding affinity and bioactivity, with superior antitumor activity to parent antibodies in TNBC. Our data suggest that BiTP might be a promising agent for TNBC treatment.",BiTP,5.555350553505534

Experimental Design: We evaluate the antitumor efficacy of the anti-AXL monoclonal antibody 20G7-D9 in several TNBC cell xenografts or patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and decipher the underlying mechanisms. In a dataset of 254 basal-like breast cancer samples, genes correlated with AXL expression are enriched in EMT, migration, and invasion signaling pathways. Results: Treatment with 20G7-D9 inhibited tumor growth and bone metastasis formation in AXL-positive TNBC cell xenografts or PDX, but not in AXL-negative PDX, highlighting AXL role in cancer growth and invasion. In vitro stimulation of AXL-positive cancer cells by its ligand GAS6 induced the expression of several EMT-associated genes (SNAIL, SLUG, and VIM) through an intracellular signaling implicating the transcription factor FRA-1, important in cell invasion and plasticity, and increased their migration/invasion capacity. 20G7-D9 induced AXL degradation and inhibited all AXL/GAS6–dependent cell signaling implicated in EMT and in cell migration/invasion. Conclusions: The anti-AXL antibody 20G7-D9 represents a promising therapeutic strategy in TNBC with mesenchymal features by inhibiting AXL-dependent EMT, tumor growth, and metastasis formation.

These patients are often treated with primary systemic chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of BRCA1/2 mutations on pathologic complete response (pCR) and disease-free survival (DFS) in a cohort of patients with TNBC treated with anthracycline and taxane-containing chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab. Patients and Methods Germline DNA was sequenced to identify mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in 493 patients with TNBC from the GeparQuinto study. The pCR rates were compared in patients with and without mutation, as well as in patients treated with and without bevacizumab. In addition, the influence of BRCA1/2 mutation status and pCR status on DFS was evaluated relative to treatment. Results BRCA1/2 mutations were detected in 18.3% of patients with TNBC. Overall, patients with mutations had a pCR rate of 50%, compared with 31.5% in patients without a mutation (odds ratio [OR], 2.17; 95% CI, 1.37 to 3.46; P = .001). The pCR rate among patients treated with bevacizumab was 61.5% for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and 35.6% for those without mutations (OR, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.43 to 5.89; P = .004). pCR was a strong predictor of DFS for patients without BRCA1/2 mutations (hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.31) but not for patients with BRCA1/2 mutations (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.32 to 1.69). Conclusion The addition of bevacizumab may increase the pCR after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with TNBC with BRCA1/2 mutations. In patients treated with anthracycline and taxane-based chemotherapy (with or without bevacizumab), pCR was a weaker predictor of DFS for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers than for patients without mutations.",bevacizumab,5.555350553505534

Thus, there is a critical need to develop new therapeutic agents that can effectively eliminate drug-resistant CSCs and improve the efficacy of cancer therapy. Here, we report that Triptolide (C1572), a small-molecule natural product, selectively depletes CSCs in a dose-dependent fashion in human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines. Nanomolar concentrations of C1572 markedly reduced c-MYC (MYC) protein levels via a proteasome-dependent mechanism.

Limited dilution assays revealed that ex vivo treatment of TNBC cells with C1572 reduced CSC levels by 28-fold. In mouse xenograft models of human TNBC, administration of C1572 suppressed tumor growth and depleted CSCs in a manner correlated with diminished MYC expression in residual tumor tissues.

The study was conducted from July 2019 to November 2020. The analyses were performed from July 2019 to June 2020.


Exposures
Race and ethnicity, including non-Hispanic African American and non-Hispanic White race.


Main Outcomes and Measures
Using logistic regression analysis and competing risk regression analysis, we estimated odds ratios (ORs) of receipt of treatment and hazard ratios (HRs) of breast cancer mortality in African American patients compared with White patients.


Results
Of 23 213 participants, 5881 (25.3%) were African American women and 17 332 (74.7%) were White women. Compared with White patients, African American patients had lower odds of receiving surgery (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.60-0.79) and chemotherapy (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81-0.99) after adjustment for sociodemographic, clinicopathologic, and county-level factors. During a 43-month follow-up, 3276 patients (14.2%) died of breast cancer. The HR of breast cancer mortality was 1.28 (95% CI, 1.18-1.38) for African American individuals after adjustment for sociodemographic and county-level factors. Further adjustment for clinicopathological and treatment factors reduced the HR to 1.16 (95% CI, 1.06-1.25). This association was observed in patients living in socioeconomically less deprived counties (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.14-1.39), urban patients (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.11-1.32), patients having stage II (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.02-1.39) or III (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01-1.31) tumors that were treated with chemotherapy, and patients younger than 65 years (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.12-1.37).


Conclusions and Relevance
In this retrospective cohort study, African American women with nonmetastatic TNBC had a significantly higher risk of breast cancer mortality compared with their White counterparts, which was partially explained by their disparities in receipt of surgery and chemotherapy.",chemotherapy,5.055350553505534

Historically, TNBC has been characterized by an aggressive natural history and worse disease-specific outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has allowed for the dissection of TNBC into molecular subtypes (i.e., basal-like, claudin-low). Within TNBC, several subtypes have emerged as ""immune-activated,"" consistently illustrating better disease outcome. In addition, NGS has revealed a host of molecular features characteristic of TNBC, including high rates of TP53 mutations, PI3K and MEK pathway activation, and genetic similarities to serous ovarian cancers, including inactivation of the BRCA pathway. Identified genetic vulnerabilities of TNBC have led to promising therapeutic approaches, including DNA-damaging agents (i.e., platinum salts and PARP inhibitors), as well as immunotherapy. Platinum salts are routinely incorporated into the treatment of metastatic TNBC; however, best outcomes are observed among those with deficiencies in the BRCA pathway. Although the incorporation of platinum in the neoadjuvant care of patients with TNBC yields higher pathologic complete response (pCR) rates, the impact on longer-term outcome is less clear. The presence of immune infiltrate in TNBC has shown both a predictive and prognostic role. Checkpoint inhibitors, including PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors, are under investigation in the setting of metastatic TNBC and have shown responses in initial clinical trials. Finally, matching emerging therapeutic strategies to optimal subtype of TNBC is of utmost importance as we design future research strategies to improve patient outcome.",PARP,4.555350553505534

In solid tumors, however, sustained antitumor responses after CAR T-cell therapy remain to be demonstrated both in the pre-clinical and clinical setting. A perceived barrier to the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy in solid tumors is the hostile tumor microenvironment where immunosuppressive soluble factors like transforming growth factor (TGF)-β are thought to inhibit the cellular immune response. Here, we analyzed whether CAR T-cells specific for the receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) antigen, that is frequently expressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), are susceptible to inhibition by TGF-β and evaluated TGF-β-receptor signaling blockade as a way of neutralizing the inhibitory effect of this cytokine. Methods CD8+ and CD4+ ROR1-CAR T-cells were prepared from healthy donors and their antitumor function analyzed using the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 in vitro and in a microphysiologic 3D tumor model. Analyses were performed in co-culture assays of ROR1-CAR T-cells and MDA-MB-231 cells with addition of exogenous TGF-β. Results The data show that exposure to TGF-β engages TGF-β-receptor signaling in CD8+ and CD4+ ROR1-CAR T-cells as evidenced by phosphorylation of small mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2. In the presence of TGF-β, the cytolytic activity, cytokine production and proliferation of ROR1-CAR T-cells in co-culture with MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells were markedly impaired, and the viability of ROR1-CAR T-cells reduced. Blockade of TGF-β-receptor signaling with the specific kinase inhibitor SD-208 was able to protect CD8+ and CD4+ ROR1-CAR T-cells from the inhibitory effect of TGF-β, and sustained their antitumor function in vitro and in the microphysiologic 3D tumor model. Combination treatment with SD-208 also led to increased viability and lower expression of PD-1 on ROR1-CAR T-cells at the end of the antitumor response. Conclusion We demonstrate the TGF-β suppresses the antitumor function of ROR1-CAR T-cells against TNBC in preclinical models. Our study supports the continued preclinical development and the clinical evaluation of combination treatments that shield CAR T-cells from TGF-β, as exemplified by the TGF-β-receptor kinase inhibitor SD-208 in this study.",SD-208,4.555350553505534

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive disease, nevertheless exhibiting a high response rate to chemotherapy. Since the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) loss confers a high sensitivity to chemotherapy regimens, we evaluated the prevalence of pRb loss in TNBCs and its relevance on the clinical outcome of patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
pRb status was prospectively evaluated by immunocytochemistry in 518 consecutive patients with complete receptor information. The predictive value of pRb status in TNBCs was determined according to the adjuvant therapeutic treatments.


RESULTS
Fifty-three tumors were identified as TNBCs. The prevalence of pRb loss was significantly higher in TNBCs than in the other cancer subtypes. All patients with TNBCs lacking pRb and treated with systemic chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil) were disease free at a medium follow-up time of 109 months, whereas the clinical outcome of those expressing pRb was significantly poorer (P = 0.008). Analysis of disease-free survival including the established anatomo-clinical prognostic parameters indicated pRb loss as the only significant predictive factor.


CONCLUSIONS
pRb loss is much more frequent in TNBCs than in the other breast cancer subtypes. Patients with TNBCs lacking pRb had a very favorable clinical outcome if treated with conventional adjuvant chemotherapy.",cyclophosphamide,4.055350553505534

Molecular studies demonstrated that TNBCs are a heterogeneous group of tumors with different clinical and pathologic features, prognosis, genetic-molecular alterations and treatment responsivity. The PI3K/AKT is a major pathway involved in the regulation of cell survival and proliferation, and is the most frequently altered pathway in breast cancer, apparently with different biologic impact on specific cancer subtypes. The most common genetic abnormality is represented by PIK3CA gene activating mutations, with an overall frequency of 20–40%. The aims of our study were to investigate PIK3CA gene mutations on a large series of TNBC, to perform a wider analysis on genetic alterations involving PI3K/AKT and BRAF/RAS/MAPK pathways and to correlate the results with clinical-pathologic data. Materials and Methods PIK3CA mutation analysis was performed by using cobas® PIK3CA Mutation Test. EGFR, AKT1, BRAF, and KRAS genes were analyzed by sequencing. Immunohistochemistry was carried out to identify PTEN loss and to investigate for PI3K/AKT pathways components. Results PIK3CA mutations were detected in 23.7% of TNBC, whereas no mutations were identified in EGFR, AKT1, BRAF, and KRAS genes. Moreover, we observed PTEN loss in 11.3% of tumors. Deregulation of PI3K/AKT pathways was revealed by consistent activation of pAKT and p-p44/42 MAPK in all PIK3CA mutated TNBC. Conclusions Our data shows that PIK3CA mutations and PI3K/AKT pathway activation are common events in TNBC. A deeper investigation on specific TNBC genomic abnormalities might be helpful in order to select patients who would benefit from current targeted therapy strategies.",PIK3CA,4.055350553505534

TNBC tumors express molecular markers of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), but its requirement during spontaneous TNBC metastasis in vivo remains incompletely understood. We demonstrated that spontaneous TNBC tumors from a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM), multiple patient-derived xenografts, and archival patient samples exhibited large populations in vivo of hybrid E/M cells that lead invasion ex vivo while expressing both epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics. The mesenchymal marker vimentin promoted invasion and repressed metastatic outgrowth. We next tested the requirement for five EMT transcription factors and observed distinct patterns of utilization during invasion and colony formation. These differences suggested a sequential activation of multiple EMT molecular programs during the metastatic cascade. Consistent with this model, our longitudinal single-cell RNA analysis detected three different EMT-related molecular patterns. We observed cancer cells progressing from epithelial to hybrid E/M and strongly mesenchymal patterns during invasion and from epithelial to a hybrid E/M pattern during colony formation. We next investigated the relative epithelial versus mesenchymal state of cancer cells in both GEMM and patient metastases. In both contexts, we observed heterogeneity between and within metastases in the same individual. We observed a complex spectrum of epithelial, hybrid E/M, and mesenchymal cell states within metastases, suggesting that there are multiple successful molecular strategies for distant organ colonization. Together, our results demonstrate an important and complex role for EMT programs during TNBC metastasis. Description TNBC uses a vimentin-dependent hybrid EMT to generate metastases with diverse epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics. The dynamics of TNBC metastasis In breast cancer lacking expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, estrogen receptor, or progesterone receptor [triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)], the roles of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition in metastasis are unclear. Here, Grasset and colleagues characterized genetically engineered mouse models of TNBC, patient-derived xenografts, and TNBC tumor tissues from patients, identifying that the mesenchymal protein vimentin was required for TNBC invasion and metastasis formation. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that TNBC cancer cells progressed from epithelial to hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal states during both invasion and colony formation, with different transcription factors being required for invasion versus colony formation. This work suggests that EMT programs in TNBC metastasis are complex and might contribute to the development of treatment resistance.",vimentin,3.5553505535055336

Our bioinformatics analysis demonstrates a unique alternative splicing pattern in TNBC compared with those of other breast cancers. In analyzing the underlying mechanism of the distinct alternative splicing profile, TDP43, a critical gene previously implicated in neurodegenerative disease, is found to promote TNBC progression. Mechanistically, TDP43 regulates extensive alternative splicing events, including downstream gene PAR3, by forming a complex with SRSF3 to regulate alternative splicing events coordinately. Splicing factors TDP43 and SRSF3, which are likely responsible for the unique alternative splicing, could serve as potential targets for TNBC therapy. Aberrant alternative splicing has been highlighted as a potential hallmark of cancer. Here, we identify TDP43 (TAR DNA-binding protein 43) as an important splicing regulator responsible for the unique splicing profile in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Clinical data demonstrate that TDP43 is highly expressed in TNBC with poor prognosis. Knockdown of TDP43 inhibits tumor progression, including proliferation and metastasis, and overexpression of TDP43 promotes proliferation and malignancy of mammary epithelial cells. Deep sequencing analysis and functional experiments indicate that TDP43 alters most splicing events with splicing factor SRSF3 (serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3), in the regulation of TNBC progression. The TDP43/SRSF3 complex controls specific splicing events, including downstream genes PAR3 and NUMB. The effect of reduced metastasis and proliferation upon the knockdown of TDP43 or SRSF3 is mediated by the splicing regulation of PAR3 and NUMB exon 12, respectively. The TDP43/SRSF3 complex and downstream PAR3 isoform are potential therapeutic targets for TNBC.",TDP43,3.5553505535055336

We investigated whether there were significant numbers of FOXP3-positive Tregs in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) using immunohistochemistry, and whether the presence of FOXP3-positive Tregs was associated with other prognostic factors, such as stage or histologic grade. We investigated the number of tumor-infiltrating FOXP3-positive Tregs in formalin-fixed TNBC specimens obtained from patients who received palliative treatment between 1999 and 2007. Material and methods. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess the number of CD4+, CD25+, and FOXP3+ Tregs in tumor tissue and normal breast tissue from 86 TNBC patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses evaluated outcomes according to the number of FOXP3-positive Tregs. Results. Of the 86 tumor specimens, 22 (25.6%) expressed more than 15 FOXP3-positive Tregs per 10 high power fields in the peritumoral area. On multivariate analysis, staining showing ≥ 15 FOXP3-positive Tregs was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and progression free survival with hazard ratios of 2.4 (95% CI 1.0–5.6; p = 0.049) and 2.0 (95% CI 1.1–3.6; p = 0.032), respectively. In TNBC, FOXP3-positive Tregs had stronger prognostic significance than did FOXP3-negative Tregs. The finding of improved survival associated with highly infiltrating FOXP3-positive Tregs in TNBC contrasted with several other types of solid cancer. Conclusion. TNBC may be differently driven by FOXP3 via an immune mechanism. The inclusion of FOXP3+ Tregs may help to improve prognostication for TNBC.",FOXP3,3.0553505535055336

Secondary outcome measures included overall survival (OS) and safety. Results After 56 months’ median follow-up, 293 of 2591 randomized patients had died. There was no statistically significant difference in OS between treatment arms in either the total population (hazard ratio 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74–1.17; P = 0.52) or pre-specified subgroups. The 5-year OS rate was 88% (95% CI 86–90%) in both treatment arms. Updated IDFS results were consistent with the primary IDFS analysis. Five-year IDFS rates were 77% (95% CI 75–79%) with chemotherapy alone versus 80% (95% CI 77–82%) with bevacizumab. From 18 months after first study dose to study end, new grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 4.6% and 4.5% of patients in the two arms, respectively. Conclusion Final OS results showed no significant benefit from bevacizumab therapy for early TNBC. Late-onset toxicities were rare in both groups. Five-year OS and IDFS rates suggest that the prognosis for patients with TNBC is better than previously thought. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00528567",bevacizumab,2.5553505535055336

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are extremely intricate in tumorigenesis and cancerous metastasis. Nonetheless, their roles in the initiation and augmentation of TNBC remain elusive. Here, in silico analysis and validation experiments were utilized to analyze the expression pattern of clinically effective lncRNAs in TNBC, among which a protective lncRNA LYPLAL1-DT was essentially curbed in TNBC samples and indicated a favorable prognosis. Gain- and loss-of-function assays elucidated that LYPLAL1-DT considerably attenuated the proliferative and metastatic properties along with epithelial-mesenchymal transition of TNBC cells. Moreover, forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) was validated to modulate the transcription of LYPLAL1-DT. Mechanistically, LYPLAL1-DT impinged on the malignancy of TNBC mainly by restraining the aberrant reactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, explicitly destabilizing and diminishing β-catenin protein by interacting with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK) and constricting the formation of the hnRNPK/β-catenin complex. Conclusively, our present research revealed the anti-oncogenic effects of LYPLAL1-DT in TNBC, unraveling the molecular mechanisms of the FOXO1/LYPLAL1-DT/hnRNPK/β-catenin signaling axis, which shed innovative light on the potential curative medicine of TNBC.",LYPLAL1-DT,2.0553505535055336

The trial investigated the safety and efficacy of the AR-antagonist enzalutamide alone or in combination with the PI3K inhibitor taselisib in patients with metastatic AR+ (≥10%) breast cancer. Patients and Methods: Phase Ib patients [estrogen receptor positive (ER+) or TNBC] with AR+ breast cancer received 160 mg enzalutamide in combination with taselisib to determine dose-limiting toxicities and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Phase II TNBC patients were randomized to receive either enzalutamide alone or in combination with 4 mg taselisib until disease progression. Primary endpoint was clinical benefit rate (CBR) at 16 weeks. Results: The combination was tolerated, and the MTD was not reached. The adverse events were hyperglycemia and skin rash. Overall, CBR for evaluable patients receiving the combination was 35.7%, and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.4 months. Luminal AR (LAR) TNBC subtype patients trended toward better response compared with non-LAR (75.0% vs. 12.5%, P = 0.06), and increased PFS (4.6 vs. 2.0 months, P = 0.082). Genomic analyses revealed subtype-specific treatment response, and novel FGFR2 fusions and AR splice variants. Conclusions: The combination of enzalutamide and taselisib increased CBR in TNBC patients with AR+ tumors. Correlative analyses suggest AR protein expression alone is insufficient for identifying patients with AR-dependent tumors and knowledge of tumor LAR subtype and AR splice variants may identify patients more or less likely to benefit from AR antagonists.",enzalutamide,2.0553505535055336

It is a relatively uncommon subgroup of breast cancers, accounting for approximately 15% of all types, and overlaps substantially with basal tumours (defined by gene expression pattern) that are the predominant tumour that develops in BRCA1 mutation carriers.1 TNBCs usually have a worse prognosis and no clear options for receptor targeted treatment.2 The recent development of drugs that target the homologous recombination repair deficiency typical of BRCA-null cancer cells has led to an increased referral of women who have developed TNBC to genetic services for (rapid) genetic testing.3 We have tested 63 isolated cases of TNBC <41 years and only eight (12.7%) had a BRCA1 mutation.

The decision to test women affected with breast cancer for BRCA mutations has traditionally been based on clinical utility (clarifying the future risks of contralateral breast cancer/ovarian cancer for the index case). Equally importantly the result may help develop a genetic test for the wider family facilitating their risk assessment and management. However, recently the utility of testing to the oncologist treating the cancer in the index case has come sharply into focus with the advent of treatments such as the PARP (poly ADP ribose polymerase) inhibitors.3 Despite the fact that treatment with PARP inhibitors is still only available through research trials, our experience in the genetic clinic is of unrealistically high expectations about the likelihood of an underlying BRCA1 mutation …",PARP,2.0553505535055336

We hypothesized that intrinsic resistance to TORC1/2 inhibition is driven by cancer stem cell (CSC)-like populations that could be targeted to enhance the antitumor action of these drugs. Therefore, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which PI3K/mTOR inhibitors affect the stem-like properties of TNBC cells. Treatment of established TNBC cell lines with a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor or a TORC1/2 inhibitor increased the expression of CSC markers and mammosphere formation. A CSC-specific PCR array revealed that inhibition of TORC1/2 increased FGF1 and Notch1 expression. Notch1 activity was also induced in TNBC cells treated with TORC1/2 inhibitors and associated with increased mitochondrial metabolism and FGFR1 signaling. Notably, genetic and pharmacologic blockade of Notch1 abrogated the increase in CSC markers, mammosphere formation, and in vivo tumor-initiating capacity induced by TORC1/2 inhibition. These results suggest that targeting the FGFR-mitochondrial metabolism-Notch1 axis prevents resistance to TORC1/2 inhibitors by eradicating drug-resistant CSCs in TNBC, and may thus represent an attractive therapeutic strategy to improve drug responsiveness and efficacy.",Notch1,1.5553505535055336

We show that EPHA2 expression is correlated with poor survival specifically in basal-like breast cancer and that its expression is repressed by miR-200a through direct interaction with the 3'UTR of EPHA2. This regulation subsequently affects the downstream activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and results in decreased cell migration of TNBC.

Blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway through monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) appears to be a promising therapeutic strategy for TNBC patients. Avelumab is a human IgG1 anti-PD-L1 mAb being tested in clinical trials that may also trigger antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against cancer cells as an additional antitumor activity. In the present work, we studied in vitro Avelumab-mediated ADCC against a panel of TNBC cells with different PD-L1 expression using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or purified NK cells from healthy donors. We determined that Avelumab significantly enhanced NK-cell mediated cytotoxicity against TNBC cells and that tumor cells expressing higher levels of PD-L1 were more sensitive to Avelumab-mediated ADCC. IFN-γ treatment upregulated PD-L1 expression in tumor cells but had a variable impact on Avelumab-mediated ADCC, which could be related to the simultaneous effect of IFN-γ on the expression of NK cell ligands. Moreover, IL-2 and IL-15 stimulation of NK cells enhanced Avelumab-triggered cytokine production and degranulation along with increased lytic activity against tumor cells. Improving the treatment of TNBC remains still a considerable challenge. This in vitro study suggests that Avelumab-mediated ADCC, independently of the blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, could be a valuable mechanism for tumor cell elimination in TNBC. Avelumab combination with immunomodulators such as IL-15 or IL-2 could be taken into consideration to increase the therapeutic efficacy of Avelumab in TNBC.",Avelumab,0.5553505535055336

Germ-line mutations may occur in up to 20% of unselected patients with TNBC, which may serve as a biomarker identifying which patients may have tumors that are particularly sensitive to platinums and/or inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase. A substantial proportion of patients with TNBCs not associated with germ-line BRCA mutations may have tumors that are ‘BRCA-like’, rendering those individuals potential candidates for similar strategies. Areas covered: The purpose of this review is to highlight the current standard and experimental treatment strategies. Expert opinion: Recent research that has illuminated the molecular heterogeneity of the disease rationalizes its diverse biological behavior and differential response to chemotherapy. Modern technology platforms provide molecular signatures that can be mined for therapeatic interventions. Target pathways that are commonly dysregulated in cancer cells control cellular processes such as apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis, DNA repair, cell cycle progression, immune modulation and invasion, and metastasis. Novel trial design and re-defined endpoints as surrogates to clinical outcome have been introduced to expedite the development of breakthrough therapies to treat high-risk early-stage breast cancer.",platinums,0.05535055350553364

Likewise, HER2-targeted therapy significantly improved the survival of HER2-positive breast cancer patients, indicating that targeted therapy is a powerful therapeutic strategy for breast cancer. However, for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive breast cancer subtype, there are no clinically approved targeted therapies, and thus, an urgent need to identify potent, highly effective therapeutic targets. In this mini-review, we describe general strategies to inhibit tumor growth by targeted therapies and briefly discuss emerging resistance mechanisms.

However, the triple negative subgroup of breast cancer (TNBC) (estrogen-, progesterone- and HER2-receptor negative) still lacks targeted treatment options. TNBC is a type of breast cancer that often affects younger women, and generally has a worse prognosis than other types of breast cancer. Recently, the complex role of the immune system in cancer growth, elimination and metastasis has been the object of increased attention. There is hope that a more detailed understanding of the intricate roles of the constituents of the immune system, will hold potential both as prognostic or predictive markers of cancer progression, but also as treatment targets for a wide range of tumors, including TNBC. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the cellular immune microenvironment in TNBC, and to highlight areas in which TNBC may differ from other types of breast cancer. Material and methods: A search of PubMed was made using the terms ‘triple negative breast cancer’ and ‘tumor infiltrating lymphocytes’, ‘CD8’, ‘CD4’, ‘B cells’, ‘natural killer cells’, ‘macrophages’, myeloid derived suppressor cells’, ‘dendritic cells’, ‘immune check point inhibitor’, ‘CTLA-4’ and ‘PD-L1’. Results: We find that whilst factors such as TILs and certain subgroups of TILs (e.g., CD8 + and regulator T-cells) have been extensively researched, none of these markers are currently applicable to routine clinical practice. Also, TNBC differs from other types of breast cancer with regards to cellular composition of the immune infiltrate and PD-L1 expression, and the prognostic significance of these. Conclusions: Immune-related factors have the potential as both prognostic and predictive biomarkers for new treatments targeting the immune system in breast cancer. However, multivariate analyses, taking other well-known factors into account, are required to determine the true value of these biomarkers. Also, differences between TNBC and other types of breast cancer may have implications for treatment and use of immune-related factors as biomarkers.",PD-L1,-0.44464944649446636

MiRNAs, ncRNAs of approximately 19–25 nucleotides in length, are involved in gene expression regulation either via degradation or silencing of the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and have roles in multiple biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. LncRNAs, which are longer than 200 nucleotides, comprise one of the largest and most heterogeneous RNA families. LncRNAs can activate or repress gene expression through various mechanisms, acting alone or in combination with miRNAs and other molecules as part of various pathways. Until recently, most research has focused on individual lncRNA and miRNA functions as regulators, and there is limited available data on ncRNA interactions relating to the tumor growth, metastasis, and therapy of cancer, acting either on mRNA alone or as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents approximately 10%–20% of all breast cancers (BCs) and is highly heterogenous and more aggressive than other types of BC, for which current targeted treatment options include hormonotherapy, PARP inhibitors, and immunotherapy; however, no targeted therapies for TNBC are available, partly because of a lack of predictive biomarkers. With advances in proteomics, new evidence has emerged demonstrating the implications of dysregulation of ncRNAs in TNBC etiology. Here, we review the roles of lncRNAs and miRNAs implicated in TNBC, including their interactions and regulatory networks. Our synthesis provides insight into the mechanisms involved in TNBC progression and has potential to aid the discovery of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",miRNAs,-1.4446494464944664

Dual targeting of EGFR using one monoclonal antibody (mAb; cetuximab or panitumumab) and one tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI; gefitinib or erlotinib) is a potential therapeutic approach. We investigated the effect of these therapies in EGFR-expressing TNBC cell lines that do or do not harbor the main activating mutations of EGFR pathways. Cell lines were sensitive to EGFR-TKIs, whereas mAbs were active only in MDA-MB-468 (EGFR amplification) and SUM-1315 (KRAS and PTEN wild-type) cells. MDA-MB-231 (KRAS mutated) and HCC-1937 (PTEN deletion) cells were resistant to mAbs. The combined treatment resulted in a synergistic effect on cell proliferation and superior inhibition of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway in mAb-sensitive cells. The anti-proliferative effect was associated with G1 cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis. Sensitivity to therapies was characterized by induction of positive regulators and inactivation of negative regulators of cell cycle. These results suggest that dual EGFR inhibition might result in an enhanced antitumor effect in a subgroup of TNBC. The status of EGFR, KRAS and PTEN could be used as a molecular marker for predicting the response to this therapeutic strategy.",cetuximab,-2.4446494464944664
Caloric restriction augments radiation efficacy in breast cancer,[],91,2013.0,bb62988c9b114ad9b23dd7f0abdfde00a4e0533a,"Dietary modification such as caloric restriction (CR) has been shown to decrease tumor initiation and progression. We sought to determine if nutrient restriction could be used as a novel therapeutic intervention to enhance cytotoxic therapies such as radiation (IR) and alter the molecular profile of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which displays a poor prognosis. In two murine models of TNBC, significant tumor regression is noted with IR or diet modification, and a greater regression is observed combining diet modification with IR. Two methods of diet modification were compared, and it was found that a daily 30% reduction in total calories provided more significant tumor regression than alternate day feeding. At the molecular level, tumors treated with CR and IR showed less proliferation and more apoptosis. cDNA array analysis demonstrated the IGF-1R pathway plays a key role in achieving this physiologic response, and multiple members of the IGF-1R pathway including IGF-1R, IRS, PIK3ca and mTOR were found to be downregulated. The innovative use of CR as a novel therapeutic option has the potential to change the biology of tumors and enhance the opportunity for clinical benefit in the treatment of patients with TNBC.",radiation,-2.9446494464944664

However, it is not well understood owing to the high levels of spatial heterogeneity within tumours, which is difficult to analyse by traditional pathological assessment. This paper describes an unbiased methodology to statistically model the spatial distribution of lymphocytes among tumour cells based on automated analysis of haematoxylin-and-eosin-stained whole-tumour section images, which is applied to two independent TNBC cohorts of 181 patients with matched microarray gene expression data. The novelty of the proposed methodology is the fusion of image analysis and statistical modelling for an integrative understanding of intratumour heterogeneity of lymphocytic infiltration. Using this methodology, a quantitative measure of intratumour lymphocyte ratio is developed and found to be significantly associated with disease-specific survival in both TNBC cohorts independent to standard clinical parameters. The proposed image-based measure compares favourably to a number of gene expression signatures of immune infiltration. In addition, heterogeneous immune infiltration at the morphological level is reflected at the molecular scale and correlated with increased expression of CTLA4, the target of ipilimumab. Taken together, these results support the fusion of high-throughput image analysis and statistical modelling to offer reproducible and robust biomarkers for the objective identification of patients with poor prognosis and treatment options.",ipilimumab,-3.9446494464944664

Deubiquitinases (DUB) are emerging drug targets. The identification of highly active DUBs in TNBC may lead to novel therapies. Experimental Design: Using DUB activity probes, we profiled global DUB activities in 52 breast cancer cell lines and 52 patients' tumor tissues. To validate our findings in vivo, we employed both zebrafish and murine breast cancer xenograft models. Cellular and molecular mechanisms were elucidated using in vivo and in vitro biochemical methods. A specific inhibitor was synthesized, and its biochemical and biological functions were assessed in a range of assays. Finally, we used patient sera samples to investigate clinical correlations. Results: Two DUB activity profiling approaches identified UCHL1 as being highly active in TNBC cell lines and aggressive tumors. Functionally, UCHL1 promoted metastasis in zebrafish and murine breast cancer xenograft models. Mechanistically, UCHL1 facilitates TGFβ signaling–induced metastasis by protecting TGFβ type I receptor and SMAD2 from ubiquitination. We found that these responses are potently suppressed by the specific UCHL1 inhibitor, 6RK73. Furthermore, UCHL1 levels were significantly increased in sera of patients with TNBC, and highly enriched in sera exosomes as well as TNBC cell–conditioned media. UCHL1-enriched exosomes stimulated breast cancer migration and extravasation, suggesting that UCHL1 may act in a paracrine manner to promote tumor progression. Conclusions: Our DUB activity profiling identified UCHL1 as a candidate oncoprotein that promotes TGFβ-induced breast cancer metastasis and may provide a potential target for TNBC treatment.",UCHL1,-4.944649446494466

One of the key reasons for the failure to develop a new therapy for this subgroup of breast cancer patients has been the difficulty in identifying a highly prevalent, targetable molecular alteration in these tumors. Recently however, the p53 gene was found to be mutated in approximately 80% of basal/TNBC, raising the possibility that targeting the mutant p53 protein product might be a new approach for the treatment of this form of breast cancer. In this study, we investigated the anti‐cancer activity of PRIMA‐1 and PRIMA‐1MET (APR‐246), two compounds which were previously reported to reactivate mutant p53 and convert it to a form with wild‐type (WT) properties. Using a panel of 18 breast cancer cell lines and 2 immortalized breast cell lines, inhibition of proliferation by PRIMA‐1 and PRIMA‐1MET was found to be cell‐line dependent, but independent of cell line molecular subtype. Although response was independent of molecular subtype, p53 mutated cell lines were significantly more sensitive to PRIMA‐1MET than p53 WT cells (p = 0.029). Furthermore, response (measured as IC50 value) correlated significantly with p53 protein level as measured by ELISA (p = 0.0089, r=−0.57, n = 19). In addition to inhibiting cell proliferation, PRIMA‐1MET induced apoptosis and inhibited migration in a p53 mutant‐dependent manner. Based on our data, we conclude that targeting mutant p53 with PRIMA‐1MET is a potential new approach for treating p53‐mutated breast cancer, including the subgroup with triple‐negative (TN) disease.",PRIMA-1MET,-4.944649446494466

However, the effect and mechanisms of chrysin on cancer metastasis are still enigmatic. In this study, metastatic triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines were used to evaluate the antimetastatic activity of chrysin. The results showed that chrysin (5, 10 and 20 μM) significantly suppressed TNBC cell migration and invasion in a dose‐dependent manner. Human matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) antibody array demonstrated that MMP‐10 was downregulated by chrysin, which was further verified by Western blotting and ELISA. Moreover, it was shown that chrysin induced increased E‐cadherin expression and decreased expression of vimentin, snail and slug in TNBC cells, suggesting that chrysin had a reversal effect on epithelial–mesenchymal transition. More importantly, it was demonstrated that inhibiting the Akt signal pathway might play a central role in chrysin‐induced antimetastatic activity by regulating MMP‐10 and epithelial–mesenchymal transition. In conclusion, our study indicates that chrysin exerts antimetastatic activities in TNBC cells, which suggests that chrysin might be a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

Here, we show that mammary‐specific deletion of Pten via WAP‐Cre, which targets alveolar progenitors, induced tumors with shortened latency compared to those induced by MMTV‐Cre, which targets basal/luminal progenitors. Combined Pten‐p53 mutations accelerated formation of claudin‐low, triple‐negative‐like breast cancer (TNBC) that exhibited hyper‐activated AKT signaling and more mesenchymal features relative to Pten or p53 single‐mutant tumors. Twenty‐four genes that were significantly and differentially expressed between WAP‐Cre:Pten/p53 and MMTV‐Cre:Pten/p53 tumors predicted poor survival for claudin‐low patients. Kinome screens identified eukaryotic elongation factor‐2 kinase (eEF2K) inhibitors as more potent than PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors on both mouse and human Pten/p53‐deficient TNBC cells. Sensitivity to eEF2K inhibition correlated with AKT pathway activity. eEF2K monotherapy suppressed growth of Pten/p53‐deficient TNBC xenografts in vivo and cooperated with doxorubicin to efficiently kill tumor cells in vitro. Our results identify a prognostic signature for claudin‐low patients and provide a rationale for using eEF2K inhibitors for treatment of TNBC with elevated AKT signaling.",eEF2K,-5.444649446494466

In contrast to other molecular subtypes, they have no identified specific target and chemotherapy remains the only available systemic treatment. The adhesion molecule nectin-4 represents a new potential therapeutic target in different cancer models. Here, we have tested the prognostic value of nectin-4 expression and assessed the therapeutic efficiency of an anti-nectin 4 antibody drug conjugate (ADC) on localised and metastatic TNBC in vitro and in vivo. Materials and methods We analysed nectin-4/PVRL4 mRNA expression in 5673 invasive breast cancers and searched for correlations with clinicopathological features including metastasis-free survival (MFS). Immunohistochemistry was carried out in 61 TNBCs and in samples of primary TNBC Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDXs). An anti-nectin-4 antibody eligible for ADC was produced and tested in vitro and in vivo in localised and metastatic TNBC PDXs. Results High nectin-4/PVRL4 mRNA expression was associated with poor-prognosis features including the TN and basal subtypes. High PVRL4 mRNA expression showed independent negative prognostic value for MFS in multivariate analysis in TNBCs. Nectin-4 protein expression was not detected in adult healthy tissues including mammary tissue. Membranous protein expression was found in 62% of TNBCs, with strong correlation with mRNA expression. We developed an ADC (N41mab-vcMMAE) comprising a human anti-nectin-4 monoclonal antibody conjugated to monomethyl auristatin-E (MMAE). In vitro, this ADC bound to nectin-4 with high affinity and specificity and induced its internalisation as well as dose-dependent cytotoxicity on nectin-4-expressing breast cancer cell lines. In vivo, this ADC induced rapid, complete and durable responses on nectin-4-positive xenograft TNBC samples including primary tumours, metastatic lesions, and local relapses; efficiency was dependent on both the dose and the nectin-4 tumour expression level. Conclusion Nectin-4 is both a new promising prognostic biomarker and specific therapeutic target for ADC in the very limited armamentarium against TNBC.",nectin-4,-5.444649446494466

Although PARP inhibitors represent a promising treatment in TNBC with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations, there is great interest in identifying drug combinations that can extend the use of PARP inhibitors to a majority of TNBC patients with wild-type BRCA1/BRCA2. Here we explored whether mTOR inhibitors, through modulating homologous recombination (HR) repair, would provide therapeutic benefit in combination with PARP inhibitors in preclinical models of BRCA-proficient TNBC. Experimental Design: We have studied the effects of mTOR inhibitors on HR repair following DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). We further demonstrated the in vitro and in vivo activities of combined treatment of mTOR inhibitors with PARP inhibitors in BRCA-proficient TNBC. Moreover, microarray analysis and rescue experiments were used to investigate the molecular mechanisms of action. Results: We found that mTOR inhibitors significantly suppressed HR repair in two BRCA-proficient TNBC cell lines. mTOR inhibitors and PARP inhibitors in combination exhibited strong synergism against these TNBC cell lines. In TNBC xenografts, we observed enhanced efficacy of everolimus in combination with talazoparib (BMN673) compared with either drug alone. We further identified through microarray analysis and by rescue assays that mTOR inhibitors suppressed HR repair and synergized with PARP inhibitors through regulating the expression of SUV39H1 in BRCA-proficient TNBCs. Conclusions: Collectively, these findings strongly suggest that combining mTOR inhibitors and PARP inhibitors would be an effective therapeutic approach to treat BRCA-proficient TNBC patients.

The survival rate for TNBC is generally worse than other breast cancer subtypes. TNBC treatment has made significant advances, but certain limitations remain. Treatment for TNBC can be challenging since the disease has various molecular subtypes. A variety of treatment options are available, such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. Chemotherapy is the most common of these options. TNBC is generally treated with systemic chemotherapy using drugs such as anthracyclines and taxanes in neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings. Developing resistance to anticancer drugs and off-target toxicity are the primary hindrances to chemotherapeutic solutions for cancer. It is imperative that researchers, clinicians, and pharmaceutical companies work together to develop effective treatment options for TNBC. Several studies have suggested nanotechnology as a potential solution to the problem of suboptimal TNBC treatment. In this review, we summarized possible treatment options for TNBC, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, combination therapy, and nanoparticle-based therapy, and some solutions for the treatment of TNBC in the future.

When Treatment Promotes Metastasis In cancer, therapy aims to kill the primary tumor and prevent metastasis. Truong et al. found that although strategies blocking β1 integrin are effective at treating primary breast tumors, they may cause metastatic disease in certain patients. In E-cadherin–positive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines, blocking β1 integrin function by gene silencing or with antibodies induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)–associated signaling and the loss of E-cadherin, enabling TNBC cells to migrate individually and invade a three-dimensional collagen matrix in culture. When injected into zebrafish, the β1 integrin–deficient cells disseminated further than the parent TNBC cells. When implanted in mice, these cells formed more lung metastases, despite producing smaller primary tumors compared with those produced by implanted parent cells. Thus, therapies targeted against β1 integrin may not be suitable for some TNBC patients. Interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) through integrin adhesion receptors provide cancer cells with physical and chemical cues that act together with growth factors to support survival and proliferation. Antagonists that target integrins containing the β1 subunit inhibit tumor growth and sensitize cells to irradiation or cytotoxic chemotherapy in preclinical breast cancer models and are under clinical investigation. We found that the loss of β1 integrins attenuated breast tumor growth but markedly enhanced tumor cell dissemination to the lungs. When cultured in three-dimensional ECM scaffolds, antibodies that blocked β1 integrin function or knockdown of β1 switched the migratory behavior of human and mouse E-cadherin–positive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells from collective to single cell movement. This switch involved activation of the transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ) signaling network that led to a shift in the balance between miR-200 microRNAs and the transcription factor zinc finger E-box–binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2), resulting in suppressed transcription of the gene encoding E-cadherin. Reducing the abundance of a TGFβ receptor, restoring the ZEB/miR-200 balance, or increasing the abundance of E-cadherin reestablished cohesion in β1 integrin–deficient cells and reduced dissemination to the lungs without affecting growth of the primary tumor. These findings reveal that β1 integrins control a signaling network that promotes an epithelial phenotype and suppresses dissemination and indicate that targeting β1 integrins may have undesirable effects in TNBC.",β1-integrin,-7.444649446494466

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) was an aggressive type of breast cancer with high rates of cancer recurrence and metastasis. The pathogenesis of TNBC is largely unknown. Recent studies suggested that lncRNA HCP5 plays an important role in carcinogenesis. The purpose of this study was to examine the function and mechanism of HCP5 in TNBC. We observed that HCP5 was upregulated in TNBC cell lines and specimens. HCP5 knockdown induced TNBC cell apoptosis, and inhibited cell proliferation and orthotopic xenograft tumor growth. RNA sequencing and antibody array suggested that HCP5 achieves its functions through regulating apoptosis pathway. Bioinformatics, luciferase and RIP experiments proved that both HCP5 and BIRC3 could competitively bind to miR‐219a‐5p. Increased BIRC3 and decreased miR‐219a‐5p were observed in TNBC tissues and cell lines. We then performed gain‐ and loss‐of‐function studies as well as rescue experiments in TNBC cells. The decrease of proliferation and migration due to HCP5 knockdown could be rescued when miR‐219a‐5p inhibitor or BIRC3 was transfected and vice versa. Our study suggested that lncRNA HCP5 promotes TNBC progression as a ceRNA to regulate BIRC3 by sponging miR‐219a‐5p.

In a mouse orthotopic model, tumors derived from TNBC cells with ADAM8 knockdown failed to grow beyond a palpable size and displayed poor vascularization. Circulating tumor cells and brain metastases were also significantly reduced. Mechanistically, ADAM8 stimulated both angiogenesis through release of VEGF‐A and transendothelial cell migration via β1‐integrin activation. In vivo, treatment with an anti‐ADAM8 antibody from the time of cell inoculation reduced primary tumor burden and metastases.

This review evaluates the activity of available chemotherapy and targeted agents in TNBC. A systematic review of PubMed and conference databases was carried out to identify randomised clinical trials reporting outcomes in women with TNBC treated with chemotherapy and targeted agents. Our review identified TNBC studies of chemotherapy and targeted agents with different mechanisms of action, including induction of synthetic lethality and inhibition of angiogenesis, growth and survival pathways. TNBC is sensitive to taxanes and anthracyclins. Platinum agents are effective in TNBC patients with BRCA1 mutation, either alone or in combination with poly adenosine diphosphate polymerase 1 inhibitors. Combinations of ixabepilone and capecitabine have added to progression-free survival (PFS) without survival benefit in metastatic TNBC. Antiangiogenic agents, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and EGFR inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy produced only modest gains in PFS and had little impact on survival. TNBC subgroups respond differentially to specific targeted agents. In future, the treatment needs to be tailored for a specific patient, depending on the molecular characteristics of their malignancy. TNBC being a chemosensitive entity, combination with targeted agents have not produced substantial improvements in outcomes.

Bevacizumab adds to the efficacy of chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer; however, there is limited data on the safety or efficacy of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. Thus, we sought to explore the safety and efficacy of the addition of bevacizumab to cisplatin in the treatment of TNBC.


METHODS
51 patients (pts) with confirmed TNBC provided informed consent and were enrolled in a single arm phase II trial of neoadjuvant cisplatin 75 mg/m2 q 3 weeks x 4 cycles and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg q 3 weeks x 3 cycles prior to definitive surgery. Only 3 cycles of bevacizumab were delivered to allow 6 weeks between the last dose of bevacizumab and surgery. Research biopsies were obtained and breast MRI performed before treatment and at surgery. Postoperatively, pts received doxorubicin and cytoxan (AC) plus bevacizumab or AC/Taxol plus bevacizumab. Median age was 50 yrs (range 30 to 66 yrs); tumors were clinical T1 (2%), T2 (80%), T3 (18%).


RESULTS
Forty-six pts are evaluable for response and 5 pts are still receiving neoadjuvant therapy. Clinical responses to date: 12/46 (26%) clinical complete response (cCR), 24/46 (52%) clinical partial response (cPR), 5/46 (11%) stable disease (SD), and 1/46 (2%) progressive disease (PD). Non-responders included 4/46 (9%) pts who discontinued protocol therapy for toxicity. To date, 7/46 (15%) pts achieved a complete pathological response (Miller-Payne 5) and an additional 10/46 (22%) were Miller-Payne 4. Five pts did not complete neoadjuvant therapy, 2 with tinnitus/hearing loss and 3 with grade 4 toxicities consisting of refractory hypertension in 1 pt and pulmonary embolism (PE) in 2 pts. Tissue-based assays to predict platinum/bevacizumab responses, including BRCA1/2 status, are underway.


CONCLUSIONS
Cisplatin and bevacizumab has some activity in TNBC as demonstrated by 37% of evaluable pts with a Miller-Payne 4 or 5 pathological response.

The microRNA-200 (miR-200) family is found to inhibit or promote breast cancer metastasis; however, the underlying mechanism is not well understood. This study was performed to investigate the effect and mechanism of miR-200b on TNBC metastasis and identify targets for developing more efficient treatment for TNBC. We found that miR-200 family expression levels are significantly lower in highly migratory TNBC cells and metastatic TNBC tumors than other types of breast cancer cells and tumors. Ectopically expressing a single member (miR-200b) of the miR-200 family drastically reduces TNBC cell migration and inhibits tumor metastasis in an orthotopic mouse mammary xenograft tumor model. We identified protein kinase Cα (PKCα) as a new direct target of miR-200b and found that PKCα protein levels are inversely correlated with miR-200b levels in 12 kinds of breast cancer cells. Inhibiting PKCα activity or knocking down PKCα levels significantly reduces TNBC cell migration. In contrast, forced expression of PKCα impairs the inhibitory effect of miR-200b on cell migration and tumor metastasis. Further mechanistic studies revealed that PKCα downregulation by miR-200b results in a significant decrease of Rac1 activation in TNBC cells. These results show that loss of miR-200b expression plays a crucial role in TNBC aggressiveness and that miR-200b suppresses TNBC cell migration and tumor metastasis by targeting PKCα. Our findings suggest that miR-200b and PKCα may serve as promising therapeutic targets for metastatic TNBC.",miR-200b,-9.444649446494466

Atezolizumab (atezo) is a humanized mAb that inhibits the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 and B7.1, thus restoring tumor-specific T-cell immunity. Atezo was evaluated in an expansion cohort of mTNBC patients (pts) in a Phase Ia study (NCT01375842). Methods. Enrollment was initially limited to TNBC pts with PD-L1 on ≥5% of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (IC2/3), then opened to pts regardless of PD-L1 status. Pts received atezo IV in 1L or 2L+ q3w at 15 or 20 mg/kg or 1200 mg for 1 y with option to be retreated at PD, or until loss of clinical benefit. ORR was assessed by RECIST v1.1 and irRC, to capture non-conventional responses. Baseline PD-L1 expression on IC was centrally scored as IC0/1/2/3 (VENTANA SP142 assay). Pretreatment tumors and on-therapy biopsies were evaluated for TILs, CD8 T cells and macrophages by IHC. Results. As of Mar 31, 2016, 115 mTNBC pts were safety evaluable; atezo was generally well tolerated. There were no additional safety signals from prior report (Emens AACR 2015). 112 pts with FU ≥12 wk were evaluable for response. Based on irRC, ORR in 1L and 2L+ pts were 26% and 11%, respectively. ORR for PD-L1 IC2/3 pts were 17% vs 8% in IC0/1. mDoR was 21.1 mo (3 to 34+). mOS of responders (n=15) was not reached (4+ to 37+ mo) with no deaths as of data cutoff. mOS of non-responders who lived ≥ 6 wk (n=87) was 9 mo (1+ to 19+ mo). OS rates in all pts at 1, 2, and 3 y were 41%, 22% and 22%, respectively. OS rates at 1, 2, and 3 y for PD-L1 IC2/3 were 45%, 28% and 28%, respectively. Pts whose tumors had >10% TILs or ≥1.35% CD8 in the tumor center trended toward higher ORR and longer OS. Atezo increased intratumoral TILs, CD8, macrophages and IC PD-L1 expression, but no response association was observed. Conclusions. In mTNBC, atezo was well tolerated. Responders showed durable clinical benefit. Response rates were higher in 1L or PD-L1 IC2/3 pts. Baseline TILs and CD8 were associated with greater clinical benefit.

Compared with patients with hormone receptor positive or Her-2 positive breast cancer, patients with TNBC are more commonly young (age <50 years), African-American and have a higher incidence of BRCA1/2 mutations. The clinical course is frequently characterized by early relapse and poor overall survival. The TNBC phenotype is impervious to therapies commonly used in other breast cancer subtypes, including hormonal therapy and Her-2 receptor antagonism. Cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the only approved treatment. With its aggressive clinical course and paucity of effective treatment options, TNBC represents an unmet clinical need. This review will focus on updates of the biologic underpinnings of TNBC and the associated treatment advances. Recent findings Numerous advancements have been made toward understanding the biologic framework of TNBC. Gene expression profiling has revealed six clinically relevant subsets of TNBC. Further study has demonstrated a portion of TNBC exhibits a strong immune gene signature. Lastly, it is now appreciated that a subgroup of sporadic TNBC shares biologic characteristics with BRCA1/2-mutated breast cancer, notably homologous repair deficiency. Recent studies focus on incorporation of platinum salts and new combinations of conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Targeted agents, including poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors, antiangiogenic agents, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway inhibitors, and androgen antagonist are also being evaluated. Most recently, checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated a modest degree of activity in a subset of TNBC. Summary These discoveries are informing novel treatment paradigms and identification of correlative biomarkers in TNBC. Improved understanding of the biologic heterogeneity of TNBC is allowing for a more effective and individualized approach to treatment.",chemotherapy,-10.944649446494466

These biological characteristics confer to TNBC a higher aggressiveness and relapse risk along with poorer prognosis compared to other subtypes. Indeed, 5-years survival rate is still low and almost all patients die, despite any adjuvant treatment which at moment represents the heading pharmacological approach. To date, several clinical trials have been designed to investigate the potential role of some molecular markers, such as VEGF, EGFR, Src and mTOR, for targeted treatments in TNBC. In fact, many inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, frequently de-regulated in TNBC, are acquiring a growing interest and several inhibitors are in preclinical development or already in early phase clinical trials. In this Review, we investigated the role of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in TNBC patients, by summarizing the molecular features that led to the distinction of different histotypes of TNBC.

The main treatment option remains chemotherapy, despite limited efficacy. New biologic and targeted agents are increasingly emerging for the treatment of TNBC. Given the continuous advances in the field of TNBC, this review assesses the latest developments in basic characterization, subtyping, and treatment of TNBC, including novel drug developments with antibody-drug conjugates, immune checkpoint inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and androgen receptor targeted agents. Abstract Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy affecting women. It is a highly heterogeneous disease broadly defined by the differential expression of cell surface receptors. In the United States, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents 15 to 20% of all BC. When compared with other subtypes of BC, TNBC tends to present in younger women, and has a higher mortality rate of 40% in advanced stages within the first 5 years after diagnosis. TNBC has historically had limited treatment options when compared to other types of BC. The mainstay of treatment for TNBC remains cytotoxic chemotherapy despite the emergence of new biologic and targeted agents. Defining the specific tumor molecular profile including PDL-1 and androgen receptor testing is expanding treatment options in the clinical setting. Identifying more targetable, novel biomarkers that may better define therapeutic targets or prognostic markers is currently underway. TNBC nomenclature is expected to be updated in favor of other nomenclature which would help direct therapy, and further redefine TNBC’s heterogeneity. Given the continuous advances in the field of TNBC, this review assesses the latest developments in basic characterization, subtyping, and treatment of TNBC, including novel drug developments with antibody-drug conjugates, immune checkpoint inhibitors, PARP inhibitors and androgen receptor targeted agents. Future trials are necessary in the face of these innovations to further support the use of new therapies in TNBC and the detection of the appropriate biomarkers.",chemotherapy,-11.444649446494466

Here, we determined the in vitro and in vivo activity of the combination of the pan-HDI panobinostat and the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine against human estrogen/progesterone receptor and HER2 (triple)-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Treatment of MB-231 and SUM159PT cells with panobinostat disrupted the hsp90/histone deacetylase 6/HSF1/p97 complex, resulting in the upregulation of hsp. This was accompanied by the induction of enhanced autophagic flux as evidenced by increased expression of LC3B-II and the degradation of the autophagic substrate p62. Treatment with panobinostat also induced the accumulation and colocalization of p62 with LC3B-II in cytosolic foci as evidenced by immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. Inhibition of panobinostat-induced autophagic flux by chloroquine markedly induced the accumulation of polyubiquitylated proteins and p62, caused synergistic cell death of MB-231 and SUM159PT cells, and inhibited mammosphere formation in MB-231 cells, compared with treatment with each agent alone. Finally, in mouse mammary fat pad xenografts of MB-231 cells, a tumor size–dependent induction of heat shock response, ER stress and autophagy were observed. Cotreatment with panobinostat and chloroquine resulted in reduced tumor burden and increased the survival of MB-231 breast cancer xenografts. Collectively, our findings show that cotreatment with an autophagy inhibitor and pan-HDI, for example, chloroquine and panobinostat results in accumulation of toxic polyubiquitylated proteins, exerts superior inhibitory effects on TNBC cell growth, and increases the survival of TNBC xenografts.

Because they cannot be treated with targeted therapies, and many do not respond to chemotherapy, they represent a clinically underserved group. TNBC is characterized by reduced expression of metastasis suppressors such as Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP), which inhibits tumor invasiveness. Mechanisms by which metastasis suppressors alter tumor cells are well characterized; however, their ability to regulate the tumor microenvironment and the importance of such regulation to metastasis suppression are incompletely understood. Here, we use species-specific RNA sequencing to show that RKIP expression in tumors markedly reduces the number and metastatic potential of infiltrating tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). TAMs isolated from nonmetastatic RKIP(+) tumors, relative to metastatic RKIP(-) tumors, exhibit a reduced ability to drive tumor cell invasion and decreased secretion of prometastatic factors, including PRGN, and shed TNFR2. RKIP regulates TAM recruitment by blocking HMGA2, resulting in reduced expression of numerous macrophage chemotactic factors, including CCL5. CCL5 overexpression in RKIP(+) tumors restores recruitment of prometastatic TAMs and intravasation, whereas treatment with the CCL5 receptor antagonist Maraviroc reduces TAM infiltration. These results highlight the importance of RKIP as a regulator of TAM recruitment through chemokines such as CCL5. The clinical significance of these interactions is underscored by our demonstration that a signature comprised of RKIP signaling and prometastatic TAM factors strikingly separates TNBC patients based on survival outcome. Collectively, our findings identify TAMs as a previously unsuspected mechanism by which the metastasis-suppressor RKIP regulates tumor invasiveness, and further suggest that TNBC patients with decreased RKIP activity and increased TAM infiltration may respond to macrophage-based therapeutics.",Maraviroc,-12.444649446494466

Identifying and engaging signaling pathways that regulate E-M/CSC plasticity within TNBC therefore remains an unmet critical clinical need. Recent evidence demonstrates that presence of E-M/CSC plasticity in TNBC correlates with a repressed interferon/STAT gene signature. Our data demonstrate that exogenous IFN-β targets and represses E-M/CSC plasticity by reengaging type I IFN signaling in CSC. Our findings have clinical relevance, as IFN-β signaling correlates with improved patient survival and repressed CSC in TNBC. Thus, our work suggests a therapeutic use for IFN-β in the repression of E-M/CSC–driven tumor recurrence and metastasis in TNBC. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the deadliest form of this disease, lacks a targeted therapy. TNBC tumors that fail to respond to chemotherapy are characterized by a repressed IFN/signal transducer and activator of transcription (IFN/STAT) gene signature and are often enriched for cancer stem cells (CSCs). We have found that human mammary epithelial cells that undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) following transformation acquire CSC properties. These mesenchymal/CSCs have a significantly repressed IFN/STAT gene expression signature and an enhanced ability to migrate and form tumor spheres. Treatment with IFN-beta (IFN-β) led to a less aggressive epithelial/non–CSC-like state, with repressed expression of mesenchymal proteins (VIMENTIN, SLUG), reduced migration and tumor sphere formation, and reexpression of CD24 (a surface marker for non-CSCs), concomitant with an epithelium-like morphology. The CSC-like properties were correlated with high levels of unphosphorylated IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (U-ISGF3), which was previously linked to resistance to DNA damage. Inhibiting the expression of IRF9 (the DNA-binding component of U-ISGF3) reduced the migration of mesenchymal/CSCs. Here we report a positive translational role for IFN-β, as gene expression profiling of patient-derived TNBC tumors demonstrates that an IFN-β metagene signature correlates with improved patient survival, an immune response linked with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and a repressed CSC metagene signature. Taken together, our findings indicate that repressed IFN signaling in TNBCs with CSC-like properties is due to high levels of U-ISGF3 and that treatment with IFN-β reduces CSC properties, suggesting a therapeutic strategy to treat drug-resistant, highly aggressive TNBC tumors.",IFN-β,-12.944649446494466

Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed representing tumors from 303 patients previously screened for BRCA1 germline mutations, of which a subset of 111 sporadic tumors had previously been analyzed with respect to BRCA1 methylation. Additionally, a set of eight tumors from BRCA1 mutation carriers were included on the TMAs. Expression analysis was performed on TMAs by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for BRCA1, pRb, p16, p53, PTEN, ER, PR, HER2, CK5/6, EGFR, MUC1 and Ki-67. Data on BRCA1 aberrations and IHC expression was examined with respect to breast cancer-specific survival. The results demonstrate that CpG island hypermethylation of BRCA1 significantly associates with the basal/triple-negative subtype. Low expression of pRb, and high/intense p16, were associated with BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation, and the same effects were seen in BRCA1 mutated tumors. The expression patterns of BRCA1, pRb, p16 and PTEN were highly correlated, and define a subgroup of TNBCs characterized by BRCA1 aberrations, high Ki-67 (≥40%) and favorable disease outcome.

Additionally, a set of eight tumors from BRCA1 mutation carriers were included on the TMAs. Expression analysis was performed on TMAs by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for BRCA1, pRb, p16, p53, PTEN, ER, PR, HER2, CK5/6, EGFR, MUC1 and Ki-67. Data on BRCA1 aberrations and IHC expression was examined with respect to breast cancer-specific survival. The results demonstrate that CpG island hypermethylation of BRCA1 significantly associates with the basal/triple-negative subtype. Low expression of pRb, and high/intense p16, were associated with BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation, and the same effects were seen in BRCA1 mutated tumors. The expression patterns of BRCA1, pRb, p16 and PTEN were highly correlated, and define a subgroup of TNBCs characterized by BRCA1 aberrations, high Ki-67 (≥40%) and favorable disease outcome. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that epigenetic inactivation of the BRCA1 gene associates with RB/p16 dysfunction in promoting TNBCs. The clinical implications relate to the potential use of targeted treatment based on PARP inhibitors in sporadic TNBCs, wherein CpG island hypermethylation of BRCA1 represents a potential marker of therapeutic response.",PARP-inhibitors,-12.944649446494466

It also has a distinct epidemiology. TNBCs are frequently of high histologic grade, typically more aggressive and difficult to treat than hormone receptor‐positive tumors, and they are associated with a higher risk of early relapse with visceral metastasis after surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. The lack of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 expression precludes the use of targeted therapies in advanced stages, and the only approved systemic treatment option is chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. In patients with advanced TNBC, responses to chemotherapy occur, but are often of short duration and it is associated with poor prognosis. The median overall survival for patients with metastatic TNBC is about 9–12 months with conventional cytotoxic agents. Given the suboptimal outcomes with chemotherapy, new targeted therapies for TNBC are urgently needed. This review summarizes the clinical efficacy, perspectives and future challenges of using new treatment options for metastatic TNBC, such as poly‐ADP‐ribose‐polymerase inhibitors, antiandrogen therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors (antiprogrammed death receptor‐1/PD‐L1 monoclonal antibodies).",bevacizumab,-13.444649446494466

Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) are considered the most aggressive type of breast cancer, for which no targeted therapy exists at the moment. These tumors are characterized by having a high degree of chromosome instability and often overexpress the spindle assembly checkpoint kinase TTK. To explore the potential of TTK inhibition as a targeted therapy in TNBC, we developed a highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of TTK, NTRC 0066-0.


RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The compound is characterized by long residence time on the target and inhibits the proliferation of a wide variety of human cancer cell lines with potency in the same range as marketed cytotoxic agents. In cell lines and in mice, NTRC 0066-0 inhibits the phosphorylation of a TTK substrate and induces chromosome missegregation. NTRC 0066-0 inhibits tumor growth in MDA-MB-231 xenografts as a single agent after oral application. To address the effect of the inhibitor in breast cancer, we used a well-defined mouse model that spontaneously develops breast tumors that share key morphologic and molecular features with human TNBC. Our studies show that combination of NTRC 0066-0 with a therapeutic dose of docetaxel resulted in doubling of mouse survival and extended tumor remission, without toxicity. Furthermore, we observed that treatment efficacy is only achieved upon co-administration of the two compounds, which suggests a synergistic in vivo effect. Therefore, we propose TTK inhibition as a novel therapeutic target for neoadjuvant therapy in TNBC.",TTK,-13.944649446494466

In this study, when analyzing the influence of m6A modulators (METTL3, METTL14, WTAP, FTO, and ALKBH5) on the prognosis of breast cancer, especially in TNBC using several on-line databases, methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) was found to have low expression in breast cancer, and was closely associated with short-distance-metastasis-free survival in TNBC. Further investigation showed that knockdown of METTL3 could enhance the ability of migration, invasion, and adhesion by decreasing m6A level in TNBC cell lines. Collagen type III alpha 1 chain (COL3A1) was identified and verified as a target gene of METTL3. METTL3 could down-regulate the expression of COL3A1 by increasing its m6A methylation, ultimately inhibiting the metastasis of TNBC cells. Finally, with immunohistochemistry staining in breast cancer tissues, it was proved that METTL3 expression was negatively correlated with COL3A1 in TNBC, but not in non-TNBC.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous group of tumors for some of which the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway may play an important role. We investigated the efficacy and toxicity of an anti-EGFR antibody (panitumumab) combined with a standard neoadjuvant anthracycline-taxane-based chemotherapy in patients with operable, stage II-III, TNBC.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Treatment in this multicentric neoadjuvant pilot study consisted of panitumumab (9 mg/kg) for eight cycles q.3 weeks combined with four cycles of 5-fluorouracil, epidoxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC100: 500/100/500 mg/m(2)) q.3 weeks, followed by four cycles of docetaxel (T: 100 mg/m(2)) q.3 weeks. Following therapy, all patients underwent surgical resection. Pathologic complete response (pCR) in assessable patients was the main end point while clinical response, toxicity and ancillary studies were secondary end points. Paraffin-embedded and frozen tumor samples were systematically collected with the aim to identify predictive biomarkers of efficacy and resistance in order to select biologically defined subpopulations for potential further clinical development of the anti-EGFR antibody.


RESULTS
Sixty patients were included with 47 assessable for pathologic response. The pCR rates were 46.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 32.5% to 61.1%] and 55.3% [95% CI: 41.1% to 69.5%] according, respectively, to Chevallier and Sataloff classifications. The complete clinical response (cCR) rate was 37.5%. Conservative surgery was carried out in 87% of cases. Toxicity was manageable. The association of high EGFR and low cytokeratin 8/18 expression in tumor cells on one hand and high density of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes on the other hand were significantly predictive of pCR.


CONCLUSIONS
Panitumumab in combination with FEC100 followed by docetaxel appears efficacious, with acceptable toxicity, as neoadjuvant therapy of operable TNBC. Several biomarkers could help define large subsets of patients with a high probability of pCR, suggesting a potential interest to further develop this combination in biologically defined subgroups of patients with TNBC.

Preclinical studies demonstrated that antiangiogenic therapy could sensitize breast cancer to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade via reprogramming tumor microenvironment. Combinational treatment of checkpoint blockade and antiangiogenesis for TNBC has not been reported. Methods Patients with advanced TNBC with less than three lines of systemic therapy were enrolled in an open-label, non-comparative, two-arm, phase II trial at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital. Camrelizumab (intravenously every 2 weeks) with apatinib orally at either continuous dosing (d1–d14) or intermittent dosing (d1–d7) was given until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities. Primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Results From January 2018 to April 2019, 40 patients were enrolled, including 10 in the apatinib intermittent dosing cohort and 30 in the apatinib continuous dosing cohort. The ORR was 43.3% (13 of 30) in the continuous dosing cohort, while no objective response was observed in the intermittent dosing cohort. The disease control rate was 63.3% (19 of 30) in the apatinib continuous dosing cohort, and 40.0% (4 of 10) in the apatinib intermittent dosing cohort, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.7 (95% CI 2.0 to 6.4) months and 1.9 (95% CI 1.8 to 3.7) months in the continuous dosing and intermittent dosing cohort, respectively. In the continuous dosing cohort, the median PFS of patients with partial response (8.3 months, 95% CI 5.9 to not reached) was significantly longer than that of patients with stable disease/progressive disease/not evaluable (2.0 months, 95% CI 1.7 to 3.0). The most common adverse events (AEs) included elevated aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase and hand-foot syndrome. Overall, 26.7% and 20.0% of patients experienced grade ≥3 AEs in the continuous dosing and intermittent dosing cohort, respectively. In the continuous dosing cohort, a high percentage of baseline tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (>10%) was associated with higher ORR and favorable PFS (p=0.029, 0.054, respectively). Conclusions The ORR by this chemo-free regimen was dramatically higher than previously reported ORR by anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody or apatinib monotherapy.

Although the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene (RB1) is frequently lost together with TP53 in TNBC, it is not directly targetable. There is thus great interest in identifying vulnerabilities downstream of RB1 that can be therapeutically exploited. Here, we determined that combined inactivation of murine Rb and p53 in diverse mammary epithelial cells induced claudin-low-like TNBC with Met, Birc2/3-Mmp13-Yap1, and Pvt1-Myc amplifications. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that Rb/p53-deficient tumors showed elevated expression of the mitochondrial protein translation (MPT) gene pathway relative to tumors harboring p53 deletion alone. Accordingly, bioinformatic, functional, and biochemical analyses showed that RB1-E2F complexes bind to MPT gene promoters to regulate transcription and control MPT. Additionally, a screen of US Food and Drug Administration-approved (FDA-approved) drugs identified the MPT antagonist tigecycline (TIG) as a potent inhibitor of Rb/p53-deficient tumor cell proliferation. TIG preferentially suppressed RB1-deficient TNBC cell proliferation, targeted both the bulk and cancer stem cell fraction, and strongly attenuated xenograft growth. It also cooperated with sulfasalazine, an FDA-approved inhibitor of cystine xCT antiporter, in culture and xenograft assays.

Recent studies have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNA) play vital roles in the development of TNBC. In this study, we found that miR-185 was strongly downregulated in TNBC tissues and cell lines and that its expression levels were associated with lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, overall survival, and relapse-free survival in TNBC. We also found that ectopic expression of miR-185 inhibited TNBC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. We further identified that miR-185 directly targeted DNMT1 and E2F6, which resulted in a marked increase in the expression of BRCA1 at the mRNA and protein levels in TNBC. Our data suggest that miR-185 functions as a tumor suppressor in TNBC development. It is a promising prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for TNBC.

Methods TNBC cells were pretreated with Noscapine or Doxorubicin or combination and combination index values were calculated using isobolographic method. Apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL staining. Female athymic Nu/nu mice were xenografted with MDA-MB-231 cells and the efficacy of Noscapine, Doxorubicin and combination was determined. Protein expression, immunohistochemical staining were evaluated in harvested tumor tissues. Results Noscapine inhibited growth of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells with the IC50 values of 36.16±3.76 and 42.7±4.3 µM respectively. The CI values (<0.59) were suggestive of strong synergistic interaction between Noscapine and Doxorubicin and combination treatment showed significant increase in apoptotic cells. Noscapine showed dose dependent reduction in the tumor volumes at a dose of 150–550 mg/kg/day compared to controls. Noscapine (300 mg/kg), Doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg) and combination treatment reduced tumor volume by 39.4±5.8, 34.2±5.7 and 82.9±4.5 percent respectively and showed decreased expression of NF-KB pathway proteins, VEGF, cell survival, and increased expression of apoptotic and growth inhibitory proteins compared to single-agent treatment and control groups. Conclusions Noscapine potentiated the anticancer activity of Doxorubicin in a synergistic manner against TNBC tumors via inactivation of NF-KB and anti-angiogenic pathways while stimulating apoptosis. These findings suggest potential benefit for use of oral Noscapine and Doxorubicin combination therapy for treatment of more aggressive TNBC.",Noscapine,-19.944649446494466

EndoTAG-1, composed of paclitaxel embedded in liposomal membranes targeting tumor endothelial cells, was evaluated for safety and efficacy in advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
One hundred and forty patients were treated with weekly EndoTAG-1 (22 mg/m(2)) plus paclitaxel (70 mg/m(2)), twice weekly EndoTAG-1 (2× 44 mg/m(2)), or weekly paclitaxel (90 mg/m(2)) for greater than or equal to four cycles (3-week treatment + 1-week rest) or until progression/toxicity. Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) rate evaluated centrally after four cycles of therapy (week 16). The study was not powered for intergroup comparisons.


RESULTS
The PFS rate at week 16 was 59.1% [one-sided 95% CI: 45.6, ∞] on combination treatment, 34.2% [21.6, ∞] on EndoTAG-1, and 48.0% [30.5, ∞] on paclitaxel. Median PFS reached 4.2, 3.4, and 3.7 months, respectively. After complete treatment (week 41 analysis), median overall survival (OS) was 13.0, 11.9, and 13.1 months for the modified Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population and 15.1, 12.5, and 8.9 months for the per-protocol population, respectively. The clinical benefit rate was 53%, 31%, and 36% for the treatment groups. Safety analysis revealed known toxicities of the drugs with slight increases of grade 3/4 neutropenia on combination therapy.


CONCLUSION
Treatment of advanced TNBC with a combination of EndoTAG-1 and standard paclitaxel [Taxol® (Bristol-Myers Squibb GmbH), or equivalent generic formulation] was well tolerated and showed antitumor efficacy. The positive trend needs to be confirmed in a randomized phase III trial.

Furthermore, the benefit of PARP inhibitors (PARPi) in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) remains unknown. Recent evidence indicates that in TNBCs, cells that display “cancer stem cell” properties are resistant to conventional treatments, mediate tumor metastasis, and contribute to recurrence. The sensitivity of breast cancer stem cells (CSC) to PARPi is unknown. Experimental Design: We determined the sensitivity of breast CSCs to PARP inhibition in BRCA1-mutant and -wild-type TNBC cell lines and tumor xenografts. We also investigated the role of RAD51 in mediating CSC resistance to PARPi in these in vitro and in vivo models. Results: We demonstrated that the CSCs in BRCA1-mutant TNBCs were resistant to PARP inhibition, and that these cells had both elevated RAD51 protein levels and activity. Downregulation of RAD51 by shRNA sensitized CSCs to PARP inhibition and reduced tumor growth. BRCA1–wild-type cells were relatively resistant to PARP inhibition alone, but reduction of RAD51 sensitized both CSC and bulk cells in these tumors to PARPi treatment. Conclusions: Our data suggest that in both BRCA1-mutant and BRCA1–wild-type TNBCs, CSCs are relatively resistant to PARP inhibition. This resistance is mediated by RAD51, suggesting that strategies aimed at targeting RAD51 may increase the therapeutic efficacy of PARPi.

Immunotherapy brings hope and opportunity to solve this challenge, while its clinical applications are greatly inhibited by the tumor immunosuppressive environment. Here, an intelligent biomimetic nanoplatform was designed based on dendritic large-pore mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DLMSNs) for suppressing metastatic TNBC by combining photothermal ablation and immune remodeling. Taking advantage of the ordered large-pore structure and easily chemically modified property of DLMSNs, the copper sulfide (CuS) nanoparticles with high photothermal conversion efficiency were in situ deposited inside the large pores of DLMSNs, and the immune adjuvant resiquimod (R848) was loaded controllably. A homogenous cancer cell membrane was coated on the surfaces of these DLMSNs, followed by conjugation with the anti-PD-1 peptide AUNP-12 through a polyethylene glycol linker with an acid-labile benzoic-imine bond. The thus-obtained AM@DLMSN@CuS/R848 was applied to holistically treat metastatic TNBC in vitro and in vivo. The data showed that AM@DLMSN@CuS/R848 had a high TNBC-targeting ability and induced efficient photothermal ablation on primary TNBC tumors under 980 nm laser irradiation. Tumor antigens thus generated and increasingly released R848 by response to the photothermal effect, combined with AUNP-12 detached from AM@DLMSN@CuS/R848 in the weakly acidic tumor microenvironment, synergistically exerted tumor vaccination, and T lymphocyte activation functions on immune remodeling to prevent TNBC recurrence and metastasis. Taken together, this study provides an intelligent biomimetic nanoplatform to enhance therapeutic outcomes in metastatic TNBC.",resiquimod,-21.444649446494466

The TNBC subtype primarily occurs in younger women of African American or Hispanic descent and tumors tend to be high grade and initially responsive to chemotherapy. However, TNBC is characteristically aggressive with high recurrence, metastatic, and mortality rates. Treatment options are limited since the hormonal receptor and HER-2 antagonists typically used for other breast cancers are ineffective. As such, the mainstay of treatment of TNBC is traditional systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy. Potential future therapies for TNBC include targeted molecular strategies including poly (adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase (PARP) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors and antiangiogenic agents.

However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we showed that knockdown of LSD1 expression (LSD1-KD) by RNAi decreased mRNA levels of HDAC isozymes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of HDAC5 expression induced the most significant accumulation of H3K4me2, a specific substrate of LSD1. Combined treatment with LSD1 inhibitor, pargyline, and HDAC inhibitor, SAHA (Vorinostat), led to superior growth inhibition and apoptotic death in TNBC cells, but exhibited additive or antagonistic effect on growth inhibition in non-TNBC counterparts or non-tumorigenic breast cells. Additionally, LSD1-KD enhanced SAHA-induced reexpression of a subset of aberrantly silenced genes, such as NR4A1, PCDH1, RGS16, BIK, and E-cadherin whose reexpression may be tumor suppressive. Genome-wide microarray study in MDA-MB-231 cells identified a group of tumor suppressor genes whose expression was induced by SAHA and significantly enhanced by LSD1-KD. We also showed that concurrent depletion of RGS16 by siRNA reduced overall cytotoxicity of SAHA and blocked the reexpression of E-cadherin, CDKN1C and ING1 in LSD1-deficient MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, cotreatment with RGS16 siRNA reversed the downregulation of nuclear factor-kappaB expression induced by combined inhibition of LSD1 and HDACs, suggesting a crucial role of RGS16 in controlling key pathways of cell death in response to combination therapy. Taken together, these results provide novel mechanistic insight into the breast cancer subtype-dependent role of LSD1 in mediating HDAC activity and therapeutic efficacy of HDAC inhibitor.",SAHA,-24.944649446494466

Intracellular PD-L1 can also protect messenger RNAs of several DNA damage repair–related genes from degradation and enhance tumor resistance to DNA-damaging therapy. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has the worst prognosis and highest risk of distant relapse in breast cancer and shows resistance to immunotherapy and radiotherapy. In this study, we found that D-mannose can promote the degradation of PD-L1 and significantly enhance immunotherapy and radiotherapy of TNBC. Since TNBC treatment is still a clinical challenge, our findings provide strategies to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of TNBC and may have clinical application. Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in women worldwide, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients have the worst prognosis and highest risk of recurrence. The therapeutic strategies for TNBC are limited. It is urgent to develop new methods to enhance the efficacy of TNBC treatment. Previous studies demonstrated that D-mannose, a hexose, can enhance chemotherapy in cancer and suppress the immunopathology of autoimmune diseases. Here, we show that D-mannose can significantly facilitate TNBC treatment via degradation of PD-L1. Specifically, D-mannose can activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to phosphorylate PD-L1 at S195, which leads to abnormal glycosylation and proteasomal degradation of PD-L1. D-mannose–mediated PD-L1 degradation promotes T cell activation and T cell killing of tumor cells. The combination of D-mannose and PD-1 blockade therapy dramatically inhibits TNBC growth and extends the lifespan of tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, D-mannose–induced PD-L1 degradation also results in messenger RNA destabilization of DNA damage repair–related genes, thereby sensitizing breast cancer cells to ionizing radiation (IR) treatment and facilitating radiotherapy of TNBC in mice. Of note, the effective level of D-mannose can be easily achieved by oral administration in mice. Our study unveils a mechanism by which D-mannose targets PD-L1 for degradation and provides methods to facilitate immunotherapy and radiotherapy in TNBC. This function of D-mannose may be useful for clinical treatment of TNBC.",D-mannose,-25.444649446494466

Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) do not express HER2 or the receptors for estrogen or progesterone, and so often have a poor prognosis. Tumor-infiltrating T cells have been well-characterized in TNBC, and increased numbers are associated with better outcomes; however, the potential roles of B cells and plasma cells have been large. Here, we conducted a retrospective correlative study on the expression of B cell/plasma cell-related genes, and the abundance and localization of B cells and plasma cells within TNBCs, and clinical outcome. We analyzed 269 TNBC samples and used immunohistochemistry to quantify tumor-infiltrating B cells and plasma cells, coupled with NanoString measurement of expression of immunoglobulin metagenes. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients bearing TNBCs with above-median densities of CD38+ plasma cells had significantly better disease-free survival (DFS) (HR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.26–0.77; p = 0.004) but not overall survival (OS), after adjusting for the effects of known prognostic factors. In contrast, TNBCs with higher immunoglobulin gene expression exhibited improved prognosis (OS p = 0.029 and DFS p = 0.005). The presence of B cells and plasma cells was positively correlated (p < 0.0001, R = 0.558), while immunoglobulin gene IGKC, IGHM, and IGHG1 mRNA expression correlated specifically with the density of CD38+ plasma cells (IGKC p < 0.0001, R = 0.647; IGHM p < 0.0001, R = 0.580; IGHG1 p < 0.0001, R = 0.655). Interestingly, after adjusting the multivariate analysis for the effect of intratumoral CD38+ plasma cell density, the expression levels of all three genes lost significant prognostic value, suggesting a biologically important role of plasma cells. Last but not least, the addition of intratumoral CD38+ plasma cell density to clinicopathological features significantly increased the prognostic value for both DFS (ΔLRχ2 = 17.28, p = 1.71E−08) and OS (ΔLRχ2 = 10.03, p = 6.32E−08), compared to clinicopathological features alone. The best combination was achieved by integrating intratumoral CD38+ plasma cell density and IGHG1 which conferred the best added prognostic value for DFS (ΔLRχ2 = 27.38, p = 5.22E−10) and OS (ΔLRχ2 = 21.29, p = 1.03E−08).

To clarify the molecular mechanisms involved in the carcinogenesis of TNBC and to identify target molecules for novel anticancer drugs, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of 30 TNBCs as well as 13 normal epithelial ductal cells that were purified by laser-microbeam microdissection. We identified 301 and 321 transcripts that were significantly upregulated and downregulated in TNBC, respectively. In particular, gene expression profile analyses of normal human vital organs allowed us to identify 104 cancer-specific genes, including those involved in breast carcinogenesis such as NEK2, PBK and MELK. Moreover, gene annotation enrichment analysis revealed prominent gene subsets involved in the cell cycle, especially mitosis. Therefore, we focused on cell cycle regulators, asp (abnormal spindle) homolog, microcephaly-associated (Drosophila) (ASPM) and centromere protein K (CENPK) as novel therapeutic targets for TNBC. Small-interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of their expression significantly attenuated TNBC cell viability due to G1 and G2/M cell cycle arrest.

The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathways function in numerous developmental processes, and alterations in both are linked with a number of common pathological diseases. Overexpression of IGF1R and FAK are closely associated with metastatic breast tumors. The present study investigated the interrelationship between IGF1R and FAK signaling in regulating the malignant properties of TNBC cells. Using small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated IGF1R silencing methods, we showed that IGF1R is essential for sustaining mesenchymal morphologies of TNBC cells and modulates the expression of EMT-related markers. We further showed that IGF1R overexpression promotes migratory and invasive behaviors of TNBC cell lines. Most importantly, IGF1R-driven migration and invasion is predominantly mediated by FAK activation and can be suppressed using pharmacological inhibitors of FAK. Our findings in TNBC cells demonstrate a novel role of the IGF1R/FAK signaling pathway in regulating critical processes involved in the metastatic cascade. These results may improve the current understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms of TNBC metastasis and provide a strong rationale for co-targeting of IGF1R and FAK as therapy for mesenchymal TNBCs.",FAK,-26.944649446494466

Because TNBC commonly displays EGF receptor (EGFR) expression, and combinations of monoclonal antibodies to EGFR effectively inhibit other tumor models, we addressed the relevance of this strategy to treatment of TNBC. Unlike a combination of the clinically approved monoclonal antibodies, cetuximab and panitumumab, which displaced each other and displayed no cooperative effects, several other combinations resulted in enhanced inhibition of TNBC’s cell growth both in vitro and in animals. The ability of certain antibody mixtures to remove EGFR from the cell surface and to promote its intracellular degradation correlated with the inhibitory potential. However, unlike EGF-induced sorting of EGFR to lysosomal degradation, the antibody-induced pathway displayed independence from the intrinsic kinase activity and dimer formation ability of EGFR, and it largely avoided the recycling route. In conclusion, although TNBC clinical trials testing EGFR inhibitors reported lack of benefit, our results offer an alternative strategy that combines noncompetitive antibodies to achieve robust degradation of EGFR and tumor inhibition.",EGFR,-27.944649446494466

However, anti-breast cancer effects of carotenoids have been controversial, albeit understudied. Here, we investigated the effects of specific carotenoids on a wide range of breast cancer cell lines, and found that among several carotenoids (including β-carotene, lutein, and astaxanthin), lutein significantly inhibits breast cancer cell growth by inducing cell-cycle arrest and caspase-independent cell death, but it has little effect on the growth of primary mammary epithelial cells (PmECs). Moreover, lutein-mediated growth inhibition of breast cancer cells is quantitatively similar to that induced by chemotherapeutic taxanes, paclitaxel and docetaxel, and exposure to lutein plus taxanes additively inhibits breast cancer cell growth. Analysis of mechanisms showed that lutein treatment significantly increases the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, but not in normal PmECs. Lutein-induced growth inhibition is also attenuated by the radical oxygen scavenger N-acetyl cysteine, suggesting a role for ROS generation in the growth inhibitory effect of lutein on TNBC cells. Additionally, we found that the p53 signaling pathway is activated and HSP60 levels are increased by lutein treatment, which may contribute partly to the induction of growth inhibition in TNBC cells. Our findings show that lutein promotes growth inhibition of breast cancer cells through increased cell type-specific ROS generation and alternation of several signaling pathways.

This study has identified GLS a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer, specifically in the basal subtype that exhibits a deregulated glutaminolysis pathway. Using inducible shRNA mediated gene knockdown, we discovered that loss of GLS function in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines with a deregulated glutaminolysis pathway led to profound tumor growth inhibition in vitro and in vivo. GLS knockdown had no effect on growth and metabolite levels in non-TNBC cell lines. We rescued the anti-tumor effect of GLS knockdown using shRNA resistant cDNAs encoding both GLS isoforms and by addition of an α-ketoglutarate (αKG) analog thus confirming the critical role of GLS in TNBC. Pharmacological inhibition of GLS with the small molecule inhibitor CB-839 reduced cell growth and led to a decrease in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity and an increase in the stress response pathway driven by activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Finally, we found that GLS inhibition synergizes with mTOR inhibition, which introduces the possibility of a novel therapeutic strategy for TNBC.

The chemokine IL-8 is overexpressed in multiple cancer types, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where it promotes the acquisition of mesenchymal features, stemness, resistance to therapies, and the recruitment of immune-suppressive cells to the tumor site. The present study explores the utility of a clinical-stage monoclonal antibody that neutralizes IL-8 (HuMax-IL8) as a potential therapeutic option for TNBC. HuMax-IL8 was shown to revert mesenchymalization in claudin-low TNBC models both in vitro and in vivo as well as to significantly decrease the recruitment of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) at the tumor site, an effect substantiated when used in combination with docetaxel. In addition, HuMax-IL8 enhanced the susceptibility of claudin-low breast cancer cells to immune-mediated lysis with NK and antigen-specific T cells in vitro. These results demonstrate the multifaceted way in which neutralizing this single chemokine reverts mesenchymalization, decreases recruitment of MDSCs at the tumor site, assists in immune-mediated killing, and forms the rationale for using HuMax-IL8 in combination with chemotherapy or immune-based therapies for the treatment of TNBC.",IL-8,-34.944649446494466

Experimental discovery of molecular signatures including the ‘BRCAness’ highlighted the innate heterogeneity of TNBC, generating the diversity of TNBC phenotypes. As it contributes to enhancing genomic instability, it has widened the therapeutic spectrum of TNBC. In particular, unusual sensitivity to DNA damaging agents was denoted in patients with BRCA deficiency, suggesting therapeutic benefit from platinum and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors. However, regardless of enriched chemosensitivity and immunogenicity, majority of patients with TNBC still suffer from dismal clinical outcomes including early relapse and metastatic spread. Therefore, efforts into more precise and personalised treatment are critical at this point. Accordingly, the advance of multiomics has revealed novel actionable targets including PI3K-Akt-mTOR and epidermal growth factor receptor signalling pathways, which might actively participate in modulating the chemosensitivity and immune system. Also, TNBC has long been considered a potential protagonist of immunotherapy in breast cancer, supported by abundant tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and heterogeneous tumour microenvironment. Despite that, earlier studies showed somewhat unsatisfactory results of monotherapy with immune-checkpoint inhibitors, consistently durable responses in responders were noteworthy. Based on these results, further combinatorial trials either with other chemotherapy or targeted agents are underway. Incorporating immune-molecular targets into combination as well as refining the standard chemotherapy might be the key to unlock the future of TNBC. In this review, we share the current and upcoming treatment options of TNBC in the framework of scientific and clinical data, especially focusing on early stage of TNBC.",chemotherapy,-36.444649446494466

Despite clinical responses in specific cancers using inhibitors targeting BRAF and MEK, resistance develops often involving nongenomic adaptive bypass mechanisms. Inhibition of MEK1/2 by trametinib in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) induced dramatic transcriptional responses, including upregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) comparing tumor samples before and after one week of treatment. In preclinical models, MEK inhibition induced genome-wide enhancer formation involving the seeding of BRD4, MED1, H3K27 acetylation, and p300 that drives transcriptional adaptation. Inhibition of the P-TEFb-associated proteins BRD4 and CBP/p300 arrested enhancer seeding and RTK upregulation. BRD4 bromodomain inhibitors overcame trametinib resistance, producing sustained growth inhibition in cells, xenografts, and syngeneic mouse TNBC models. Pharmacologic targeting of P-TEFb members in conjunction with MEK inhibition by trametinib is an effective strategy to durably inhibit epigenomic remodeling required for adaptive resistance.Significance: Widespread transcriptional adaptation to pharmacologic MEK inhibition was observed in TNBC patient tumors. In preclinical models, MEK inhibition induces dramatic genome-wide modulation of chromatin, in the form of de novo enhancer formation and enhancer remodeling.

Here, we found that inducible IκB kinase-related (IKK-related) kinase IKBKE expression and JAK/STAT pathway activation compose a cytokine signaling network in the immune-activated subset of TNBC. We found that treatment of cultured IKBKE-driven breast cancer cells with CYT387, a potent inhibitor of TBK1/IKBKE and JAK signaling, impairs proliferation, while inhibition of JAK alone does not. CYT387 treatment inhibited activation of both NF-κB and STAT and disrupted expression of the protumorigenic cytokines CCL5 and IL-6 in these IKBKE-driven breast cancer cells. Moreover, in 3D culture models, the addition of CCL5 and IL-6 to the media not only promoted tumor spheroid dispersal but also stimulated proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. Interruption of cytokine signaling by CYT387 in vivo impaired the growth of an IKBKE-driven TNBC cell line and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). A combination of CYT387 therapy with a MEK inhibitor was particularly effective, abrogating tumor growth and angiogenesis in an aggressive PDX model of TNBC.

It is generally considered to be the most difficult breast cancer subtype to deal with, due to the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which usually direct targeted therapies. In this scenario, the current treatments of TNBC-affected patients rely on tumor excision and conventional chemotherapy. As a result, the prognosis is overall poor. Thus, the identification and characterization of targets for novel therapies are urgently required. The Notch signaling pathway has emerged to act in the pathogenesis and tumor progression of TNBCs. Firstly, Notch receptors are associated with the regulation of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) behavior, as well as with the aetiology of TNBCs. Secondly, there is a strong evidence that Notch pathway is a relevant player in mammary cancer stem cells maintenance and expansion. Finally, Notch receptors expression and activation strongly correlate with the aggressive clinicopathological and biological phenotypes of breast cancer (e.g., invasiveness and chemoresistance), which are relevant characteristics of TNBC subtype. The purpose of this up-to-date review is to provide a detailed overview of the specific role of all four Notch receptors (Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, and Notch4) in TNBCs, thus identifying the Notch signaling pathway deregulation/activation as a pathognomonic feature of this breast cancer subtype.

We evaluated the pathological complete response (pCR) rate after neoadjuvant epirubicin, (E) cyclophosphamide (C) and docetaxel containing chemotherapy with and without the addition of bevacizumab in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients with untreated cT1c-4d TNBC represented a stratified subset of the 1948 participants of the HER2-negative part of the GeparQuinto trial. Patients were randomized to receive four cycles EC (90/600 mg/m(2); q3w) followed by four cycles docetaxel (100 mg/m(2); q3w) each with or without bevacizumab (15 mg/kg; q3w) added to chemotherapy.


RESULTS
TNBC patients were randomized to chemotherapy without (n = 340) or with bevacizumab (n = 323). pCR (ypT0 ypN0, primary end point) rates were 27.9% without and 39.3% with bevacizumab (P = 0.003). According to other pCR definitions, the addition of bevacizumab increased the pCR rate from 30.9% to 41.8% (ypT0 ypN0/+; P = 0.004), 36.2% to 46.4% (ypT0/is ypN0/+; P = 0.009) and 32.9% to 43.3% (ypT0/is ypN0; P = 0.007).

However, many aggressive cancers such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) currently lack well-defined therapeutic targets against which such agents can be developed. The identification of tumor-associated antigens and the generation of antibody drug-conjugates represent an emerging area of intense interest and growth in the field of cancer therapeutics. Glycoprotein non-metastatic b (GPNMB) has recently been identified as a gene that is over-expressed in numerous cancers, including TNBC, and often correlates with the metastatic phenotype. In breast cancer, GPNMB expression in the tumor epithelium is associated with a reduction in disease-free and overall survival. Based on these findings, glembatumumab vedotin (CDX-011), an antibody-drug conjugate that selectively targets GPNMB, is currently being investigated in clinical trials for patients with metastatic breast cancer and unresectable melanoma. This review discusses the physiological and potential pathological roles of GPNMB in normal and cancer tissues, respectively, and details the clinical advances and challenges in targeting GPNMB-expressing malignancies.",glembatumumab,-42.944649446494466

However, little is known regarding their tumor microenvironment (TME) heterogeneity. Methods Here, we investigated TME heterogeneity within each TNBC molecular subtype, including immune infiltrate localization and composition together with expression of targetable immune pathways, using publicly available transcriptomic and genomic datasets from a large TNBC series totaling 1512 samples. Associations between molecular subtypes and specific features were assessed using logistic regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results We demonstrated that each TNBC molecular subtype exhibits distinct TME profiles associated with specific immune, vascularization, stroma, and metabolism biological processes together with specific immune composition and localization. The immunomodulatory subtype was associated with the highest expression of adaptive immune-related gene signatures and a fully inflamed spatial pattern appearing to be the optimal candidate for immune check point inhibitors. In contrast, most mesenchymal stem-like and luminal androgen receptor tumors showed an immunosuppressive phenotype as witnessed by high expression levels of stromal signatures. Basal-like, luminal androgen receptor, and mesenchymal subtypes exhibited an immune cold phenotype associated with stromal and metabolism TME signatures and enriched in margin-restricted spatial pattern. Tumors with high chromosomal instability and copy number loss in the chromosome 5q and 15q regions, including genomic loss of major histocompatibility complex related genes, showed reduced cytotoxic activity as a plausible immune escape mechanism. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that each TNBC subtype is associated with specific TME profiles, setting the ground for a rationale tailoring of immunotherapy in TNBC patients.",immunotherapy,-42.944649446494466

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been directly linked to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy. Here we report that ROS induced either by chemotherapy (paclitaxel) or antioxidant depletion induce PD-L1 expression in macrophages. PD-L1 positive macrophages have immune-suppressive and angiogenic properties that interfere with the efficacy of paclitaxel in vivo. Indeed, PD-L1 blockade reverts this effect and synergizes with paclitaxel to reduce tumor growth. Our work reveals a pathway that further supports the importance of combining taxane and PD-L1 inhibitors as promising anticancer strategy in TNBC. The combination of immune checkpoint blockade with chemotherapy is currently under investigation as a promising strategy for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most prominent component of the breast cancer microenvironment because they influence tumor progression and the response to therapies. Here we show that macrophages acquire an immunosuppressive phenotype and increase the expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) when treated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) inducers such as the glutathione synthesis inhibitor, buthionine sulphoximine (BSO), and paclitaxel. Mechanistically, these agents cause accumulation of ROS that in turn activate NF-κB signaling to promote PD-L1 transcription and the release of immunosuppressive chemokines. Systemic in vivo administration of paclitaxel promotes PD-L1 accumulation on the surface of TAMS in a mouse model of TNBC, consistent with in vitro results. Combinatorial treatment with paclitaxel and an anti-mouse PD-L1 blocking antibody significantly improved the therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel by reducing tumor burden and increasing the number of tumor-associated cytotoxic T cells. Our results provide a strong rationale for the use of anti–PD-L1 blockade in the treatment of TNBC patients. Furthermore, interrogation of chemotherapy-induced PD-L1 expression in TAMs is warranted to define appropriate patient selection in the use of PD-L1 blockade.",paclitaxel,-43.944649446494466

Since DNA methylation-induced silencing of tumor suppressors is common in cancer, reversal of promoter DNA hypermethylation by 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (decitabine), an FDA-approved DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor, has proven effective in treating hematological neoplasms. However, its antitumor effect varies in solid tumors, stressing the importance of identifying biomarkers predictive of therapeutic response. Here, we focused on the identification of biomarkers to select decitabine-sensitive TNBC through increasing our understanding of the mechanism of decitabine action. We showed that protein levels of DNMTs correlated with response to decitabine in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) organoids originating from chemotherapy-sensitive and -resistant TNBCs, suggesting DNMT levels as potential biomarkers of response. Furthermore, all 3 methytransferases, DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, were degraded following low-concentration, long-term decitabine treatment both in vitro and in vivo. The DNMT proteins could be ubiquitinated by the E3 ligase, TNF receptor–associated factor 6 (TRAF6), leading to lysosome-dependent protein degradation. Depletion of TRAF6 blocked decitabine-induced DNMT degradation, conferring resistance to decitabine.

However, most solid tumors, such as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), do not have identifiable surface markers to distinguish themselves from normal cells, thus it is challenging to selectively identify and eliminate those malignances by PTT. In this report, we hypothesized that, by targeting CD44 (one TNBC-overexpressed surface molecule) and depleting heat shock protein 72 (HSP72, one malignancy-specific-overexpressed thermotolerance-related chaperone) subsequently, the TNBC could be selectively sensitized to PTT and improve the accuracy of treatment. To this end, a rationally designed nanosystem gold nanostar (GNS)/siRNA against HSP72 (siHSP72)/hyaluronic acid (HA) was successfully constructed using a layer-by-layer method.

The CD44-targeting ability of GNS/siHSP72/HA was confirmed by the flow cytometer, confocal microscopic imaging, and competitive binding analysis. The HSP72 silencing efficacy of GNS/siHSP72/HA was ∼95% in complete culture medium. By targeting CD44 and depleting HSP72 sequentially, GNS/siHSP72/HA could selectively sensitize TNBC cells to hyperthermia and enhance the therapeutic efficacy to TNBC with minimal side effect both in vitro and in vivo.

Immunotherapy has shown promising results in various types of cancer, including breast cancer. Here, we investigated a new combination strategy where histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are applied with immune checkpoint inhibitors to improve immunotherapy responses in TNBC. Testing different epigenetic modifiers, we focused on the mechanisms underlying HDACi as priming modulators of immunotherapy. Tumor cells were co-cultured with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and flow cytometric immunophenotyping was performed to define the role of epigenetic priming in promoting tumor antigen presentation and immune cell activation. We found that HDACi up-regulate PD-L1 mRNA and protein expression in a time-dependent manner in TNBC cells, but not in hormone responsive cells. Focusing on TNBC, HDACi up-regulated PD-L1 and HLA-DR on tumor cells when co-cultured with PBMCs and down-regulated CD4+ Foxp3+ Treg in vitro. HDACi significantly enhanced the in vivo response to PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade in the triple-negative 4T1 breast cancer mouse model, the only currently available experimental system with functional resemblance to human TNBC. This resulted in a significant decrease in tumor growth and increased survival, associated with increased T cell tumor infiltration and a reduction in CD4+ Foxp3+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment.

While up to 20% of women under 50 years of age with TNBC harbor germline mutations in BRCA1, and these tumors are sensitive to treatment with poly(ADP) ribose polymerase inhibitors, a majority of TNBCs lack BRCA1 mutations or loss of expression. Findings presented here demonstrate that by attenuating the levels of DNA damage response and homologous recombination proteins, pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDI) treatment induces ‘BRCAness’ and sensitizes TNBC cells lacking BRCA1 to lethal effects of PARP inhibitor or cisplatin. Treatment with HDI also induced hyperacetylation of nuclear hsp90. Similar effects were observed following shRNA-mediated depletion of HDAC3, confirming its role as the deacetylase for nuclear HSP90. Furthermore, cotreatment with HDI and ABT-888 induced significantly more DNA strand breaks than either agent alone, and synergistically induced apoptosis of TNBC cells. Notably, co-treatment with HDI and ABT-888 significantly reduced in vivo tumor growth and markedly improved the survival of mice bearing TNBC cell xenografts. These findings support the rationale to interrogate the clinical activity of this novel combination against human TNBC, irrespective of its expression of mutant BRCA1.",HDI,-47.444649446494466

There are currently no targeted therapies to treat TNBC. This study offers therapeutic targets for blocking TNBC metastasis: cell-surface antigen CUB-domain containing protein 1 (CDCP1) and proteins in the lipid metabolism pathway. CDCP1 regulates lipid metabolism by reducing cytoplasmic lipid droplet abundance, stimulating fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation. This metabolic pathway likely contributes to the energy production required for cell migration and metastasis of TNBC, and represents a potential therapeutic target. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is notoriously aggressive with high metastatic potential, which has recently been linked to high rates of fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Here we report the mechanism of lipid metabolism dysregulation in TNBC through the prometastatic protein, CUB-domain containing protein 1 (CDCP1). We show that a “low-lipid” phenotype is characteristic of breast cancer cells compared with normal breast epithelial cells and negatively correlates with invasiveness in 3D culture. Using coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering and two-photon excited fluorescence microscopy, we show that CDCP1 depletes lipids from cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs) through reduced acyl-CoA production and increased lipid utilization in the mitochondria through FAO, fueling oxidative phosphorylation. These findings are supported by CDCP1’s interaction with and inhibition of acyl CoA-synthetase ligase (ACSL) activity. Importantly, CDCP1 knockdown increases LD abundance and reduces TNBC 2D migration in vitro, which can be partially rescued by the ACSL inhibitor, Triacsin C. Furthermore, CDCP1 knockdown reduced 3D invasion, which can be rescued by ACSL3 co-knockdown. In vivo, inhibiting CDCP1 activity with an engineered blocking fragment (extracellular portion of cleaved CDCP1) lead to increased LD abundance in primary tumors, decreased metastasis, and increased ACSL activity in two animal models of TNBC. Finally, TNBC lung metastases have lower LD abundance than their corresponding primary tumors, indicating that LD abundance in primary tumor might serve as a prognostic marker for metastatic potential. Our studies have important implications for the development of TNBC therapeutics to specifically block CDCP1-driven FAO and oxidative phosphorylation, which contribute to TNBC migration and metastasis.",CDCP1,-47.944649446494466

The molecular heterogeneity of TNBC and lack of high frequency driver mutations other than TP53 have hindered the development of new and effective therapies that significantly improve patient outcomes. miRNAs, global regulators of survival and proliferation pathways important in tumor development and maintenance, are becoming promising therapeutic agents. We performed miRNA-profiling studies in different TNBC subtypes to identify miRNAs that significantly contribute to disease progression. We found that miR-34a was lost in TNBC, specifically within mesenchymal and mesenchymal stem cell-like subtypes, whereas expression of miR-34a targets was significantly enriched. Furthermore, restoration of miR-34a in cell lines representing these subtypes inhibited proliferation and invasion, activated senescence, and promoted sensitivity to dasatinib by targeting the proto-oncogene c-SRC. Notably, SRC depletion in TNBC cell lines phenocopied the effects of miR-34a reintroduction, whereas SRC overexpression rescued the antitumorigenic properties mediated by miR-34a. miR-34a levels also increased when cells were treated with c-SRC inhibitors, suggesting a negative feedback exists between miR-34a and c-SRC. Moreover, miR-34a administration significantly delayed tumor growth of subcutaneously and orthotopically implanted tumors in nude mice, and was accompanied by c-SRC downregulation. Finally, we found that miR-34a and SRC levels were inversely correlated in human tumor specimens. Together, our results demonstrate that miR-34a exerts potent antitumorigenic effects in vitro and in vivo and suggests that miR-34a replacement therapy, which is currently being tested in human clinical trials, represents a promising therapeutic strategy for TNBC.",miR-34a,-49.444649446494466

To identify new therapeutic targets in TNBC, we performed a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen for protein kinases commonly amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer. Using this approach, we identified AKT3 as a gene preferentially required for the growth of TNBCs. Downregulation of Akt3 significantly inhibits the growth of TNBC lines in three-dimensional (3D) spheroid cultures and in mouse xenograft models, whereas loss of Akt1 or Akt2 have more modest effects. Akt3 silencing markedly upregulates the p27 cell-cycle inhibitor and this is critical for the ability of Akt3 to inhibit spheroid growth. In contrast with Akt1, Akt3 silencing results in only a minor enhancement of migration and does not promote invasion. Depletion of Akt3 in TNBC sensitizes cells to the pan-Akt inhibitor GSK690693.

However, more than half of TNBC patients do not achieve a pCR and have a very poor prognosis. The lack of drug-targetable receptors on TNBC tumours has made improving the available interventions in TNBC an area of important medical need. The routine use of neoadjuvant anthracycline/taxane combinations in TNBC is currently being supplemented by ongoing investigations of their use with other types of agent. In particular, the substantial proportion of TNBC tumours associated with BRCA1 mutations is driving clinical research into the use of DNA-damaging agents such as platinums, as well as of potentiators of DNA damage such as the investigational agent iniparib and inhibitors of poly-ADP ribose polymerase such as olaparib.

In this context, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have emerged as a clinically relevant and highly reproducible biomarker capable of affecting BC prognosis and response to treatment. Indeed, the evaluation of TILs on primary tumors proved to be strongly prognostic in triple-negative (TN) BC patients treated with either adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as well as in early TNBC patients not receiving any systemic treatment, thus gaining level-1b evidence in this setting. In addition, a strong relationship between TILs and pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been reported in all BC subtypes and the prognostic role of higher TILs in early HER2-positive breast cancer patients has also been demonstrated. The interest in BC immune infiltrates has been further fueled by the introduction of the first immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment armamentarium of advanced TNBC in patients with PD-L1-positive status by FDA-approved assays. However, despite these advances, a biomarker capable of reliably and exhaustively predicting immunotherapy benefit in BC is still lacking, highlighting the imperative need to further deepen this issue. Finally, more comprehensive evaluation of immune infiltrates integrating both the quantity and quality of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and incorporation of TILs in composite scores encompassing other clinically or biologically relevant biomarkers, as well as the adoption of software-based and/or machine learning platforms for a more comprehensive characterization of BC immune infiltrates, are emerging as promising strategies potentially capable of optimizing patient selection and stratification in the research field.

A cohort including human BC biopsies obtained at Institut Curie as well as normal tissues has been analyzed at a gene-expression level. The data revealed that the human protein kinase monopolar spindle 1 (hMPS1), also known as TTK and involved in mitotic checkpoint, is specifically overexpressed in TNBC, compared to the other BC subgroups and healthy tissues. We confirmed by immunohistochemistry and reverse phase protein array that TNBC expressed higher levels of TTK protein compared to the other BC subgroups. We then determined the biological effects of TTK depletion by RNA interference, through analyses of tumorigenic capacity and cell viability in different human TNBC cell lines. We found that RNAi-mediated depletion of TTK in various TNBC cell lines severely compromised their viability and their ability to form colonies in an anchorage-independent manner. Moreover, we observed that TTK silencing led to an increase in H2AX phosphorylation, activation of caspases 3/7, sub-G1 cell population accumulation and high annexin V staining, as well as to a decrease in G1 phase cell population and an increased aneuploidy. Altogether, these data indicate that TTK depletion in TNBC cells induces apoptosis.

BETd-246 was more potent and effective in TNBC cells than its parental BET inhibitor compound BETi-211. RNA-seq analysis revealed predominant downregulation of a large number of genes involved in proliferation and apoptosis in cells treated with BETd-246, as compared with BETi-211 treatment that upregulated and downregulated a similar number of genes. Functional investigations identified the MCL1 gene as a critical downstream effector for BET degraders, which synergized with small-molecule inhibitors of BCL-xL in triggering apoptosis. In multiple murine xenograft models of human breast cancer, BETd-246 and a further optimized analogue BETd-260 effectively depleted BET proteins in tumors and exhibited strong antitumor activities at well-tolerated dosing schedules.

Mechanistically, elevation of pyrimidine nucleotides induced by chemotherapy is dependent on increased activity of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway. Pharmacologic inhibition of de novo pyrimidine synthesis sensitizes TNBC cells to genotoxic chemotherapy agents by exacerbating DNA damage.

From Models to Breast Cancer Treatments Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a particularly aggressive form, have few treatment options. Targeting either the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to Akt (PI3K-Akt) pathway or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibits tumor growth in some patients, but durable responses are rare. Modeling studies using cell lines predict that the EGFR family member HER3 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 3) may confer drug resistance. Now, Tao et al. provide evidence from patient tumors to support those predictions. Treatment with PI3K-Akt pathway inhibitors increased the abundance of both total and activated HER3 in TNBC cells in culture and TNBC xenografts in mice. Residual tumors from patients treated with EGFR inhibitors had increased abundance and activation of HER3. Combining inhibitors of the PI3K-Akt pathway with a dual inhibitor of EGFR and HER3 substantially suppressed tumor growth in mice with TNBC xenografts derived from either cell lines or patients, suggesting that this combined strategy may improve therapeutic outcome in TNBC patients. Both abundant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or ErbB1) and high activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt pathway are common and therapeutically targeted in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, activation of another EGFR family member [human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) (or ErbB3)] may limit the antitumor effects of these drugs. We found that TNBC cell lines cultured with the EGFR or HER3 ligand EGF or heregulin, respectively, and treated with either an Akt inhibitor (GDC-0068) or a PI3K inhibitor (GDC-0941) had increased abundance and phosphorylation of HER3. The phosphorylation of HER3 and EGFR in response to these treatments was reduced by the addition of a dual EGFR and HER3 inhibitor (MEHD7945A). MEHD7945A also decreased the phosphorylation (and activation) of EGFR and HER3 and the phosphorylation of downstream targets that occurred in response to the combination of EGFR ligands and PI3K-Akt pathway inhibitors. In culture, inhibition of the PI3K-Akt pathway combined with either MEHD7945A or knockdown of HER3 decreased cell proliferation compared with inhibition of the PI3K-Akt pathway alone. Combining either GDC-0068 or GDC-0941 with MEHD7945A inhibited the growth of xenografts derived from TNBC cell lines or from TNBC patient tumors, and this combination treatment was also more effective than combining either GDC-0068 or GDC-0941 with cetuximab, an EGFR-targeted antibody. After therapy with EGFR-targeted antibodies, some patients had residual tumors with increased HER3 abundance and EGFR/HER3 dimerization (an activating interaction). Thus, we propose that concomitant blockade of EGFR, HER3, and the PI3K-Akt pathway in TNBC should be investigated in the clinical setting.",MEHD7945A,-53.444649446494466

However, in highly aggressive metastatic triple‐negative breast cancers (TNBC) the role of β‐catenin and the underlying mechanism(s) for the aggressiveness of TNBC remain unknown. We illustrate that WNT10B induces transcriptionally active β‐catenin in human TNBC and predicts survival‐outcome of patients with both TNBC and basal‐like tumours. We provide evidence that transgenic murine Wnt10b‐driven tumours are devoid of ERα, PR and HER2 expression and can model human TNBC. Importantly, HMGA2 is specifically expressed during early stages of embryonic mammogenesis and absent when WNT10B expression is lost, suggesting a developmentally conserved mode of action. Mechanistically, ChIP analysis uncovered that WNT10B activates canonical β‐catenin signalling leading to up‐regulation of HMGA2. Treatment of mouse and human triple‐negative tumour cells with two Wnt/β‐catenin pathway modulators or siRNA to HMGA2 decreases HMGA2 levels and proliferation. We demonstrate that WNT10B has epistatic activity on HMGA2, which is necessary and sufficient for proliferation of TNBC cells. Furthermore, HMGA2 expression predicts relapse‐free‐survival and metastasis in TNBC patients.",HMGA2,-53.944649446494466

Here, we used the high prevalence of TP53 mutations in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) to compare ctDNA and CTC detection rates and prognostic value in metastatic TNBC patients. Forty patients were enrolled before starting a new line of treatment. TP53 mutations were characterized in archived tumor tissues and in plasma DNA using two next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms in parallel. Archived tumor tissue was sequenced successfully for 31/40 patients. TP53 mutations were found in 26/31 (84%) of tumor samples. The same mutation was detected in the matched plasma of 21/26 (81%) patients with an additional mutation found only in the plasma for one patient. Mutated allele fractions ranged from 2 to 70% (median 5%). The observed correlation between the two NGS approaches (R2 = 0.903) suggested that ctDNA levels data were quantitative. Among the 27 patients with TP53 mutations, CTC count was ≥1 in 19 patients (70%) and ≥5 in 14 patients (52%). ctDNA levels had no prognostic impact on time to progression (TTP) or overall survival (OS), whereas CTC numbers were correlated with OS (p = 0.04) and marginally with TTP (p = 0.06). Performance status and elevated LDH also had significant prognostic impact.

Here, we highlight a new cross talk between chronic oxidative stress and the histone variant H2AX, a key player in DNA repair. We observe that persistent accumulation of ROS, due to a deficient JunD‐/Nrf2‐antioxidant response, reduces H2AX protein levels. This effect is mediated by an enhanced interaction of H2AX with the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF168, which is associated with H2AX poly‐ubiquitination and promotes its degradation by the proteasome. ROS‐mediated H2AX decrease plays a crucial role in chemosensitivity. Indeed, cycles of chemotherapy that sustainably increase ROS reduce H2AX protein levels in Triple‐Negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. H2AX decrease by such treatment is associated with an impaired NRF2‐antioxidant response and is indicative of the therapeutic efficiency and survival of TNBC patients. Thus, our data describe a novel ROS‐mediated regulation of H2AX turnover, which provides new insights into genetic instability and treatment efficacy in TNBC patients.",chemotherapy,-54.444649446494466

The lack of expression of targetable proteins such as the estrogen receptor and absence of HER2 amplification have made relying on cytotoxic chemotherapy necessary for decades. In the operable setting, efforts to improve outcomes have focused on escalation of systemic therapy and a shift toward preoperative delivery followed by a response adapted approach to postoperative systemic therapy. An improved understanding of tumor biology has resulted in the identification of subsets of patients with specific molecular features, leading to testing and approval of multiple new targeted therapies for this disease. Furthermore, advances in drug development have led to the approval of antibody-drug conjugates that are redefining classification schemes for breast cancer. This review focuses on the modern management of TNBC, with particular focus on recent updates in the treatment of operable disease, and an overview of the most recent promising advances in the therapeutic landscape of metastatic disease. It discusses the practical challenges and unanswered questions resulting from the approval of neoadjuvant immunotherapy and shares an approach in the clinic on topics for which evidence is lacking. In addition, it provides a glimpse into the future, highlighting challenges and opportunities for biomarker based right-sizing of preoperative therapy, refining evaluation of response to preoperative therapy after surgery, early diagnosis and detection of relapse, and areas of needed research for metastatic TNBC.",chemotherapy,-55.944649446494466

PARPs are a family of enzymes involved in multiple cellular processes, including DNA repair. TNBC shares multiple clinico-pathologic features with BRCA-mutated breast cancers, which harbor dysfunctional DNA repair mechanisms. Investigators hypothesized that PARP inhibition, in conjunction with the loss of DNA repair via BRCA-dependent mechanisms, would result in synthetic lethality and augmented cell death. This hypothesis has borne out in both preclinical models and in clinical trials testing PARP inhibitors in both BRCA-deficient and triple-negative breast cancer. The focus of this review includes an overview of the preclinical rationale for evaluating PARP inhibitors in TNBC, the presumed mechanism of action of this novel therapeutic class, promising results from several influential clinical trials of PARP inhibition in advanced breast cancer (both TNBC and BRCA deficient), proposed mechanisms of acquired resistance to PARP inhibitors, and, finally, concludes with current challenges and future directions for the development of PARP inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer.

While genomic and phenotypic intra-tumor heterogeneity are pervasive features of TNBCs at the time of diagnosis, the functional contributions of heterogeneous tumor cell populations to chemoresistance have not been elucidated. To investigate tumor evolution accompanying NACT, we employed orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of treatment-naive TNBC, which retain intra-tumor heterogeneity characteristic of human TNBC. We discovered that some PDX models initially exhibited partial sensitivity to standard front-line NACT (Adriamycin plus Cytoxan, AC). Following AC, residual tumors were resistant to chemotherapy but repopulated tumors with chemo-sensitive cells if left untreated, indicating that tumor cells possessed inherent plasticity. To identify the tumor cell subpopulation(s) conferring chemoresistance, we conducted barcode-mediated clonal tracking in three independent PDX models by introducing a high-complexity pooled lentiviral barcode library into PDX tumor cells which were then orthotopically engrafted into recipient mice. Strikingly, residual tumors maintained the same heterogeneous clonal architecture as naive tumors. Concordantly, whole-exome sequencing revealed conservation of genomic subclonal architecture throughout treatment. These results were corroborated by genomic sequencing of serial biopsies pre- and post-AC obtained directly from TNBC patients enrolled on an ongoing clinical trial at MD Anderson (ARTEMIS; NCT02276443). Together, these studies revealed that genomically distinct pre-treatment subclones were equally capable of surviving AC to reconstitute tumors after treatment. To identify functional addictions of residual tumor cells, we conducted histologic and transcriptomic profiling. Residual tumors following AC-treatment exhibited extensive fibrotic desmoplasia and tumor cell pleomorphism in both PDX models and in serial biopsies obtained from TNBC patients enrolled on the ARTEMIS trial. Strikingly, these AC-induced features were reverted upon regrowth of residual tumors in PDXs and in patients9 tumors. Similarly, residual tumors exhibited unique transcriptomic features, many of which are also de-regulated in cohorts of human TNBCs undergoing chemotherapy treatment. These features were nearly completely reverted after tumors regrew, suggesting that the residual tumor state may be a unique and transient therapeutic window. Gene set enrichment analyses revealed that residual tumors had increased activation of oxidative phosphorylation and decreased glycolytic signaling. Pharmacologic targeting of oxidative phosphorylation with a small-molecule inhibitor of mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I (IACS-010759) significantly delayed the regrowth of AC-treated residual tumors in three independent PDX models. Collectively, these studies reveal that a reversible phenotypic state can confer chemoresistance in the absence of genomic selection and that the residual tumor state is a novel therapeutic window for chemo-refractory TNBC.

This acronym simply means that the tumour does not express oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) and does not exhibit amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene. Despite this unambiguous definition, TNBCs are an heterogeneous group of tumours with just one common clinical feature: a distinctly aggressive nature with higher rates of relapse and shorter overall survival in the metastatic setting compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. Because of the absence of well-defined molecular targets, cytotoxic chemotherapy is currently the only treatment option for TNBC. In the last decades, the use of more aggressive chemotherapy has produced a clear improvement of the prognosis in women with TNBC, but this approach results in an unacceptable deterioration in the quality of life, also if some support therapies try to relieve patients from distress. In addition, there is the general belief that it is impossible to further improve the prognosis of TNBC patients with chemotherapy alone. In view of that, there is a feverish search for new “clever drugs” able both to rescue chemo-resistant, and to reduce the burden of chemotherapy in chemo-responsive TNBC patients. A major obstacle to identifying actionable targets in TNBC is the vast disease heterogeneity both inter-tumour and intra-tumour and years of study have failed to demonstrate a single unifying alteration that is targetable in TNBC. TNBC is considered the subtype that best benefits from the neoadjuvant model, since the strong correlation between pathological Complete Response and long-term Disease-Free-Survival in these patients. In this review, we discuss the recent discoveries that have furthered our understanding of TNBC, with a focus on the subtyping of TNBC. We also explore the implications of these discoveries for future treatments and highlight the need for a completely different type of clinical trials.",chemotherapy,-60.944649446494466

To discover potential therapeutic targets for the poor prognosis-associated triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), gene expression profiling was carried out on a cohort of 130 breast cancer samples. Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) was found to be significantly overexpressed in TNBC compared with the other breast cancer subtypes. High PLK1 expression was confirmed by reverse phase protein and tissue microarrays. In triple-negative cell lines, RNAi-mediated PLK1 depletion or inhibition of PLK1 activity with a small molecule (BI-2536) induced an increase in phosphorylated H2AX, G(2)-M arrest, and apoptosis. A soft-agar colony assay showed that PLK1 silencing impaired clonogenic potential of TNBC cell lines. When cells were grown in extracellular matrix gels (Matrigel), and exposed to BI-2536, apoptosis was observed specifically in TNBC cancerous cells, and not in a normal cell line. When administrated as a single agent, the PLK1 inhibitor significantly impaired tumor growth in vivo in two xenografts models established from biopsies of patients with TNBC. Most importantly, the administration of BI-2536, in combination with doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide chemotherapy, led to a faster complete response compared with the chemotherapy treatment alone and prevented relapse, which is the major risk associated with TNBC. Altogether, our observations suggest PLK1 inhibition as an attractive therapeutic approach, in association with conventional chemotherapy, for the management of patients with TNBC.",BI-2536,-61.944649446494466

Recently, exosomes have attracted more and more attention as a drug delivery system. As endogenous vesicles, exosomes ensure low immunogenicity, nontoxicity, and long blood circulation time. In addition, immune cell-derived exosomes can mimic the immune cell to target tumor cells. Herein, we developed a macrophage-derived exosome-coated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoplatform for targeted chemotherapy of TNBC. To further improve the tumor targetability, the surface of the exosome was modified with a peptide to target the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-Met), which is overexpressed by TNBC cells. The results showed that the engineered exosome-coated nanoparticles significantly improved the cellular uptake efficiency and the antitumor efficacy of doxorubicin. In vivo study demonstrated that the nanocarriers exhibited remarkable tumor-targeting efficacy, led to increased inhibition of tumor growth and induced intense tumor apoptosis.

Thus, these tumors are routinely treated with cytotoxic chemotherapies (e.g., anthracyclines), which can cause severe side effects that impact quality of life. Recent studies indicate that the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB) pathway is an important determinant in TNBC disease progression and therapeutic outcome. Furthermore, new therapeutic agents have been developed that specifically target the RB pathway, potentially positioning RB as a novel molecular marker for directing treatment. The current study evaluates the efficacy of pharmacological CDK4/6 inhibition in combination with the widely used genotoxic agent doxorubicin in the treatment of TNBC. Results demonstrate that in RB-proficient TNBC models, pharmacological CDK4/6 inhibition yields a cooperative cytostatic effect with doxorubicin but ultimately protects RB-proficient cells from doxorubicin-mediated cytotoxicity. In contrast, CDK4/6 inhibition does not alter the therapeutic response of RB-deficient TNBC cells to doxorubicin-mediated cytotoxicity, indicating that the effects of doxorubicin are indeed dependent on RB-mediated cell cycle control. Finally, the ability of CDK4/6 inhibition to protect TNBC cells from doxorubicin-mediated cytotoxicity resulted in recurrent populations of cells specifically in RB-proficient cell models, indicating that CDK4/6 inhibition can preserve cell viability in the presence of genotoxic agents. Combined, these studies suggest that while targeting the RB pathway represents a novel means of treatment in aggressive diseases such as TNBC, there should be a certain degree of caution when considering combination regimens of CDK4/6 inhibitors with genotoxic compounds that rely heavily on cell proliferation for their cytotoxic effects.",doxorubicin,-64.44464944649447

Iron oxide nanoparticles functionalized with ICAM-1 antibody (ICAM-IONP) were synthesized as MRI probes. An in vivo signal enhancement of 2.6-fold for ICAM-IONPs was measured relative to controls, demonstrating that ICAM-1 is a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for TNBC treatment. Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) have a high mortality rate owing to aggressive proliferation and metastasis and a lack of effective therapeutic options. Herein, we describe the overexpression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in human TNBC cell lines and tissues, and demonstrate that ICAM-1 is a potential molecular target and biomarker for TNBC therapy and diagnosis. We synthesized ICAM-1 antibody-conjugated iron oxide nanoparticles (ICAM-IONPs) as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probe to evaluate tumor targeting. Quantitative analysis of ICAM-1 surface expression predicted the targeting capability of ICAM-IONPs to TNBC cells. MRI of the TNBC xenograft tumor after systemic administration of ICAM-IONPs, coupled with iron quantification and histology, demonstrated a significant and sustained MRI contrast enhancement and probe accumulation in tumors with ICAM-1 overexpression relative to control.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) ligands regulated by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote accumulation of fibrosis and cancer progression. In the present study, we have evaluated TNBC tumors with enhanced collagen to determine whether we can reduce metastasis by targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD), an anti-fibrotic agent as well as a TGF-β antagonist. In patient-derived xenograft models, TNBC tumors exhibited accumulated collagen and activated TGF-β signaling, and developed lung metastasis. Next, primary CAFs were established from 4T1 TNBC homograft tumors, TNBC xenograft tumors and tumor specimens of breast cancer patients. CAFs promoted primary tumor growth with more fibrosis and TGF-β activation and lung metastasis in 4T1 mouse model. We then examined the effects of PFD in vitro and in vivo. We found that PFD had inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production of CAFs in 2D culture. Furthermore, CAFs enhanced tumor growth and PFD inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs by causing apoptosis in the 3D co-culture assay of 4T1 tumor cells and CAFs. In vivo, PFD alone inhibited tumor fibrosis and TGF-β signaling but did not inhibit tumor growth and lung metastasis. However, PFD inhibited tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically in combination with doxorubicin. Thus, PFD has great potential for a novel clinically applicable TNBC therapy that targets tumor-stromal interaction.",Pirfenidone,-66.44464944649447

Aggressive, triple‐negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are enriched for tumour‐initiating cells (TICs). We investigated that hypothesis that VEGF receptors expressed on TNBC cells mediate autocrine signalling that contributes to tumour initiation. We discovered the VEGF receptor neuropilin‐2 (NRP2) is expressed preferentially on TICs, involved in the genesis of TNBCs and necessary for tumour initiation. The mechanism by which NRP2 signalling promotes tumour initiation involves stimulation of the α6β1 integrin, focal adhesion kinase‐mediated activation of Ras/MEK signalling and consequent expression of the Hedgehog effector GLI1. GLI1 also induces BMI‐1, a key stem cell factor, and it enhances NRP2 expression and the function of α6β1, establishing an autocrine loop. NRP2 can be targeted in vivo to retard tumour initiation. These findings reveal a novel autocrine pathway involving VEGF/NRP2, α6β1 and GLI1 that contributes to the initiation of TNBC.

The MUC1-C transmembrane oncoprotein is aberrantly overexpressed in TNBC and, like xCT, has been linked to maintaining glutathione (GSH) levels and redox balance. However, there is no known interaction between MUC1-C and xCT. Here we show that silencing MUC1-C is associated with decreases in xCT expression in TNBC cells. The results demonstrate that MUC1-C forms a complex with xCT and the CD44 variant (CD44v), which interacts with xCT and thereby controls GSH levels. MUC1-C binds directly with CD44v and in turn promotes stability of xCT in the cell membrane. The interaction between MUC1-C and xCT is further supported by the demonstration that targeting xCT with silencing or the inhibitor sulfasalazine suppresses MUC1 gene transcription by increasing histone and DNA methylation on the MUC1 promoter. In terms of the functional significance of the MUC1-C/xCT interaction, we show that MUC1-C protects against treatment with erastin, an inhibitor of XC− and inducer of ferroptosis, a form of non-apoptotic cell death.

In addition, we enrolled 82 TNBC patients who underwent taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) to further verify the predictive value of the signature. In both the training and validation sets, the integrated signature had better prognostic value than clinicopathologic parameters. We also confirmed the interaction between the administration of taxane-based NCT and different risk groups. In the NCT cohort, patients in the low-risk group were more likely to achieve pathologic complete remission after taxane-based NCT (P = 0.014). Functionally, we showed that HIF1A-AS2 and AK124454 promoted cell proliferation and invasion in TNBC cells and contributed there to paclitaxel resistance.

MYC regulates expression of RNA, both protein and non-coding, that control central metabolic pathways, cell death, proliferation, differentiation, stress pathways, and mechanisms of drug resistance. Activation of MYC has been widely reported in breast cancer progression. Breast cancer is a complex heterogeneous disease and treatment options are primarily guided by histological and biochemical evaluations of the tumors. Based on biochemical markers, three main breast cancer categories are ER+ (estrogen receptor alpha positive), HER2+ (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive), and TNBC (triple-negative breast cancer; estrogen receptor negative, progesterone receptor negative, HER2 negative). MYC is elevated in TNBC compared with other cancer subtypes. Interestingly, MYC-driven pathways are further elevated in aggressive breast cancer cells and tumors that display drug resistant phenotype. Identification of MYC target genes is essential in isolating signaling pathways that drive tumor development. In this review, we address the role of MYC in the three major breast cancer subtypes and highlight the most promising leads to target MYC functions.",MYC,-68.94464944649447

Finding effective targets for chemotherapy-resistant TNBC has proven difficult in part because of TNBC's molecular heterogeneity. We have previously reported that likely because of the antiapoptotic activity of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast epithelial and cancer cells, high GR expression/activity in early-stage TNBC significantly correlates with chemotherapy resistance and increased recurrence. We hypothesized that pretreatment with mifepristone, a GR antagonist, would potentiate the efficacy of chemotherapy in GR+ TNBCs by inhibiting the antiapoptotic signaling pathways of GR and increasing the cytotoxic efficiency of chemotherapy. Experimental Design: TNBC cell apoptosis was examined in the context of physiologic glucocorticoid concentrations, chemotherapy, and/or pharmacologic concentrations of mifepristone. We used high-throughput live microscopy with continuous recording to measure apoptotic cells stained with a fluorescent dye and Western blot analysis to detect caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. The effect of mifepristone on GR-mediated gene expression was also measured. TNBC xenograft studies were performed in female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice and tumors were measured following treatment with vehicle, paclitaxel, or mifepristone/paclitaxel. Results: We found that although mifepristone treatment alone had no significant effect on TNBC cell viability or clonogenicity in the absence of chemotherapy, the addition of mifepristone to dexamethasone/paclitaxel treatment significantly increased cytotoxicity and caspase-3/PARP cleavage. Mifepristone also antagonized GR-induced SGK1 and MKP1/DUSP1 gene expression while significantly augmenting paclitaxel-induced GR+ MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumor shrinkage in vivo. Conclusions: These results suggest that mifepristone pretreatment could be a useful strategy for increasing tumor cell apoptosis in chemotherapy-resistant GR+ TNBC.

The incidence of TNBC is higher in young minority women who suffer from high rates of early recurrence and death from their disease. Mounting preclinical evidence supports targeting the Ras/MAPK cell signaling pathway in the TNBC subtype, despite large genomic surveys such as The Cancer Genome Atlas demonstrating infrequent canonical mutations in this pathway. Due to the early spread of TNBC, targeted treatment in the neoadjuvant setting may offer the effective therapeutic punch needed to eliminate micro-metastatic disease and reduce mortality.

The presence of one or more of these receptors suggests that a treatment targeting these pathways might be effective, while the absence of, or in the case of HER2, lack of overexpression of, all of these receptors, termed triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), indicates a need for the more toxic chemotherapy. In an effort to develop targeted therapies for TNBC, it will be necessary to differentiate among specific TNBC subtypes. The subset of TNBC that expresses androgen receptor (AR) has been determined to express genes consistent with a luminal subtype and therefore may be amenable to therapies targeting either AR, itself, or other pathways typical of a luminal subtype. Recent investigations of the AR signal pathway within breast cancer lead to AR as a significant target for breast cancer therapy with several clinical trials currently in progress. The subclass of TNBC that lacks AR, which we have termed quadruple negative breast cancer (QNBC) currently lacks a defined targetable pathway. Unlike AR-positive TNBC, QNBC predominantly exhibits a basal-like molecular subtype. Several subtypes and related pathway proteins are preferentially expressed in QNBC that may serve as effective targets for treatment, such as ACSL4, SKP2 and EGFR. ACSL4 expression has been demonstrated to be inversely correlated with expression of hormone/growth factor receptors and may thus serve as a biomarker for QNBC as well as a target for therapy.

Up to 30% of mesenchymal TNBC can be classified histologically as metaplastic breast cancer, a chemorefractory group of tumors with a mixture of epithelial and mesenchymal components identifiable by light microscopy. While assays to identify mesenchymal TNBC are under development, metaplastic breast cancer serves as a clinically identifiable surrogate to evaluate potential regimens for mesenchymal TNBC. Objective To assess safety and efficacy of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition in combination with liposomal doxorubicin and bevacizumab in patients with advanced metaplastic TNBC. Design, Setting, and Participants Phase 1 study with dose escalation and dose expansion at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center of patients with advanced metaplastic TNBC. Patients were enrolled from April 16, 2009, to November 4, 2014, and followed for outcomes with a cutoff date of November 1, 2015, for data analysis. Interventions Liposomal doxorubicin, bevacizumab, and the mTOR inhibitors temsirolimus or everolimus using 21-day cycles. Main Outcomes and Measures Safety and response. When available, archived tissue was evaluated for aberrations in the PI3K pathway. Results Fifty-two women with metaplastic TNBC (median age, 58 years; range, 37-79 years) were treated with liposomal doxorubicin, bevacizumab, and temsirolimus (DAT) (N = 39) or liposomal doxorubicin, bevacizumab, and everolimus (DAE) (N = 13). The objective response rate was 21% (complete response = 4 [8%]; partial response = 7 [13%]) and 10 (19%) patients had stable disease for at least 6 months, for a clinical benefit rate of 40%. Tissue was available for testing in 43 patients, and 32 (74%) had a PI3K pathway aberration.

There is increasing evidence of the role of tumor lymphocytic immune infiltrates in this subtype of breast cancer. Robust levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been associated with improved disease-free and overall survival rates in TNBC patients with and without any treatment. Recent efforts have been made to develop a standardized methodology for evaluating TILs. The presence of TILs in the breast tumor microenvironment can also predict responses not only to neoadjuvant but also to adjuvant chemotherapy treatments. High numbers of TILs correlate with increased pathological complete responses (pCR) in TNBC. TILs are prognostic and predictive of response to standard therapies; thus, the immune system appears to play an active role in a subgroup of breast cancer. There is an increasing interest in directly targeting the immune system as part of breast cancer therapy, mainly in patients with TNBC. New immune modulatory agents, including immune checkpoints inhibitors, have shown promising activity in a subgroup of metastatic TNBC. Increased programmed cell death protein 1 ligand (PD-L1) expression on the surface of TNBC provides the rationale for implementing therapeutic strategies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in TNBC.

This has been hypothesised to confer particular sensitivity to DNA-damaging platinum chemotherapy. The TNT trial, a randomized phase III trial in women with metastatic or recurrent locally advanced TNBC or BRCA1/2 mutation-associated breast cancer, aimed to test this hypothesis and examine treatment effect in biological subgroups. Patients & Methods: Eligible patients had either ER-, PR-, HER2- breast cancer or were known BRCA1/2 carriers (any ER/PR/HER2). Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either C (AUC 6 q3wk) or D (100mg/m2 q3wk) for 6-8 cycles or until disease progression if sooner and could cross over to the alternative treatment on confirmed progression. Ineligible patients included those who had ECOG performance status >2, received adjuvant taxane therapy in the last 12 mths, any previous treatment with a platinum chemotherapy, or previous non-anthracycline chemotherapy for metastatic disease. For consenting patients a blood sample and archived tissue samples were obtained for BRCA1/2 genotyping and central biomarker analysis (primary tumour, lymph nodes and recurrent tumour biopsy if available) of subtypes within TNBC and biomarkers of DNA repair deficiency. The primary endpoint was RECIST objective tumour response up to cycle 6 of randomised treatment. Secondary endpoints included toxicity, progression free survival (PFS), time to progression and overall survival. TNT aimed to detect a 15% improvement in ORR with C compared to D, with planned target sample size range of 370-450 depending on assumed ORR in D patients (2-sided α=0.05, power=90%). 376 (188 C, 188 D) were recruited from 74 UK centres between Apr 08 and Mar 14. Results: A snapshot of the data was taken on 30/5/14 at which point 336 (89.4%) patients had experienced a PFS event, with overall median PFS time of 4.4 mths. Median age of patients was 55 yrs (IQR 48-63). 366/376 (97%) patients had TNBC of whom 18 were also known BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, with the remaining 10 patients receptor +ve and BRCA1/2 carriers. 338/376 (90%) had metastatic and 38/376 (10%) recurrent locally advanced disease. 53% had liver or lung metastases affecting the parenchyma and 34% had received previous adjuvant taxane therapy. Median time from initial diagnosis to entering TNT was 2.2 yrs (IQR 1.5-3.5). Primary tumour tissue has currently been received for 277 patients, blood from 286 patients and recurrent tumour tissue from 85 patients. Discussion: TNT will report evidence on the activity of single agent platinum chemotherapy compared with single agent taxane in patients with TNBC and BRCA1/2 associated breast cancer. Correlative analyses of BRCA1/2 mutation status, subtypes and DNA repair biomarkers will also be reported. TNT will be the first randomised trial to report the activity of platinum compared with standard chemotherapy within TNBC subtypes and in relation to BRCA1/2 mutation status and DNA repair biomarkers. Safety, tolerability and response to crossover treatment will also be presented.

In the present study, NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD pyroptosis pathway was involved in the DDP-induced anti-tumor effect of TNBC in vitro and in vivo, providing evidence that DDP might induce pyroptosis in TNBC. Moreover, DDP activated NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD pyroptosis pathway by up-regulating the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3). Furthermore, knockdown of MEG3 not only partly abolished the activation effect of DDP on NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD pathway-mediated pyroptosis, but also reversed the suppression of DDP on tumor growth and metastasis ability in vitro and in vivo, further confirming that MEG3 may partially mediate the pyroptotic signaling upon DDP treatment. Thus, our data uncovered a novel mechanism that DDP induced pyroptosis via activation of MEG3/NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD pathway in TNBC to exert anti-tumor effects, which may help to develop new strategies for the therapeutic interventions in TNBC.",Cisplatin,-83.94464944649447

Common prognostic biomarkers give very restricted predictive information of tumor recurrences in TNBC. Human serum contains stably expressed microRNAs (miRNAs), which have been discovered to predict prognosis in patients with cancer. The purpose of this study was to identify circulating biomarkers able to predict clinical outcome in TNBC. Experimental Design: We performed genome-wide serum miRNA expression and real-time PCR analyses to investigate the ability of miRNAs in predicting tumor relapse in serum samples from 60 primary TNBC. Patients were divided into training and testing cohorts. Results: By Cox regression analysis, we identified a four-miRNA signature (miR-18b, miR-103, miR-107, and miR-652) that predicted tumor relapse and overall survival. This miRNA signature was further validated in an independent cohort of 70 TNBC. A high-risk signature score was developed and significantly associated with tumor recurrence and reduced survival. Multivariate Cox regression models indicated that the risk score based on the four-miRNA signature was an independent prognostic classifier of patients with TNBC. Conclusions: This signature may serve as a minimally invasive predictor of tumor relapse and overall survival for patients with TNBC. This prediction model may ultimately lead to better treatment options for patients with TNBC. Clin Cancer Res; 21(5); 1207–14. ©2014 AACR.",miRNAs,-98.44464944649447

Experimental Design: Female patients with measurable, locally advanced or metastatic TNBC initially received dasatinib 100 mg twice daily (BID); to improve tolerability, the protocol was amended and subsequent patients received 70 mg BID. Primary endpoint was Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors–defined objective response rate (ORR); secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), safety, and limited pharmacokinetics. Results: Of the 44 treated patients, 43 were response evaluable. ORR was 4.7%: two patients had confirmed partial responses lasting 14 and 58 weeks, respectively. Of 11 patients with stable disease, two continued for more than 16 weeks, thus protocol-defined DCR was 9.3%. Median PFS was 8.3 weeks (95% CI: 7.3–15.3). Five patients discontinued before first tumor assessment. No grade 4 adverse events (AE) were reported; grade 3 AEs occurring in more than 5% of patients were fatigue (9.1%), diarrhea, pleural effusion, and dyspnea (all 6.8%). Laboratory abnormalities were uncommon. Dasatinib at 100 mg BID was not well tolerated; rates of treatment interruption, dose reduction, and serious AEs were lower with dasatinib 70 mg BID. Conclusions: Single-agent dasatinib has limited activity in unselected patients with TNBC. Dasatinib 70 mg BID was better tolerated than 100 mg BID.

Introduction: TNBC is a mutationally complex breast cancer subtype with poor prognosis and no current targeted therapy options. Compared with other intrinsic breast cancer subtypes, TNBC has higher programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels, which may hinder antitumor T-cell responses. MPDL3280A is a monoclonal anti-PDL1 antibody, engineered for optimized efficacy and safety, that blocks signaling through the PD-L1/PD-1 and PD-L1/B7.1 pathways.

Methods: MPDL3280A was tested in a metastatic TNBC expansion cohort as part of a multicenter Phase Ia study. Pts received MPDL3280A at 15 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg or 1200 mg flat dose IV q3w. AEs were summarized for the safety follow-up duration from the first dose to 30 days after the last dose before the clinical cutoff on Sept 2, 2014. Responses were assessed by RECIST v1.1 criteria in pts who received MPDL3280A by Jul 21, 2014, evaluable for efficacy (≥ 6-wk follow-up). PD-L1 expression on tumor-infiltrating immune cells (ICs) at baseline was centrally evaluated by IHC in archival or fresh biopsies, and pts were scored as PD-L1 IHC (IC) 0, 1, 2 or 3. Peripheral biomarkers were assayed using FACS and multiplex immunoassays.

Results: In the TNBC cohort, 27 pts were selectively enrolled. These pts had a median age of 48 y (29-82 y) and were evaluable for safety; 52% had ECOG PS 0 and 44% had ECOG PS 1. Visceral and bone metastases were present at baseline in 59% and 11% of pts, respectively. In addition, 85% received ≥ 4 prior systemic regimens (neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic), including anthracyclines (78%), taxanes (82%) and platinum agents (15% cisplatin, 41% carboplatin). All-grade treatment-related AEs occurred in 67% of pts, most frequently fatigue (22%), pyrexia (15%), neutropenia (15%) and nausea (15%). 11% of pts experienced a Grade 3-5 related AE (5 Grade 3 events: adrenal insufficiency, neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, decreased WBC count; 1 Grade 5 pulmonary hypertension event in a pt with an atrial septal defect). Among 21 efficacy-evaluable PD-L1 IHC 2 or 3 pts (13 IHC 2 and 8 IHC 3), the unconfirmed RECIST ORR was 24% (95% CI, 8% to 47%); 3 PRs and 2 CRs were observed. Response duration ranged from 0.1+ to 41.6+ wks, with the median not yet reached. Pts with evidence of durable nonclassical responses suggestive of pseudoprogression were also observed. Overall, the 24-wk PFS rate was 33% (95% CI, 12% to 53%). Biomarker analysis revealed transient elevation of plasma cytokines and proliferating CD8 cells following MPDL3280A treatment. Updated clinical data, including PD-L1-negative pts, will be presented.

Conclusions: MPDL3280A was generally well tolerated and demonstrated promising efficacy in pretreated metastatic PD-L1 IHC 2 or 3 TNBC pts. Furthermore, circulating biomarker analyses revealed pharmacodynamic responses to MPDL3280A. Clinical evaluation of MPDL3280A in metastatic PD-L1 IHC 0 or 1 TNBC is ongoing ([NCT01375842][1]).

A significant proportion of patients with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Sequencing of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) after surgery, along with enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), may be used to detect minimal residual disease and assess which patients may experience disease recurrence.


Objective
To determine whether the presence of ctDNA and CTCs after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early-stage TNBC is independently associated with recurrence and clinical outcomes.


Design, Setting, and Participants
A preplanned secondary analysis was conducted from March 26, 2014, to December 18, 2018, using data from 196 female patients in BRE12-158, a phase 2 multicenter randomized clinical trial that randomized patients with early-stage TNBC who had residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy to receive postneoadjuvant genomically directed therapy vs treatment of physician choice. Patients had blood samples collected for ctDNA and CTCs at time of treatment assignment; ctDNA analysis with survival was performed for 142 patients, and CTC analysis with survival was performed for 123 patients. Median clinical follow-up was 17.2 months (range, 0.3-58.3 months).


Interventions
Circulating tumor DNA was sequenced using the FoundationACT or FoundationOneLiquid Assay, and CTCs were enumerated using an epithelial cell adhesion molecule-based, positive-selection microfluidic device.


Main Outcomes and Measures
Primary outcomes were distant disease-free survival (DDFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS).


Results
Among 196 female patients (mean [SD] age, 49.6 [11.1] years), detection of ctDNA was significantly associated with inferior DDFS (median DDFS, 32.5 months vs not reached; hazard ratio [HR], 2.99; 95% CI, 1.38-6.48; P = .006). At 24 months, DDFS probability was 56% for ctDNA-positive patients compared with 81% for ctDNA-negative patients. Detection of ctDNA was similarly associated with inferior DFS (HR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.28-5.57; P = .009) and inferior OS (HR, 4.16; 95% CI,1.66-10.42; P = .002). The combination of ctDNA and CTCs provided additional information for increased sensitivity and discriminatory capacity. Patients who were ctDNA positive and CTC positive had significantly inferior DDFS compared with those who were ctDNA negative and CTC negative (median DDFS, 32.5 months vs not reached; HR, 5.29; 95% CI, 1.50-18.62; P = .009). At 24 months, DDFS probability was 52% for patients who were ctDNA positive and CTC positive compared with 89% for those who were ctDNA negative and CTC negative. Similar trends were observed for DFS (HR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.07-9.27; P = .04) and OS (HR, 8.60; 95% CI, 1.78-41.47; P = .007).


Conclusions and Relevance
In this preplanned secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, detection of ctDNA and CTCs in patients with early-stage TNBC after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was independently associated with disease recurrence, which represents an important stratification factor for future postneoadjuvant trials.

TNBC accounts for about 15% of breast cancer cases in the U.S., and is known for high relapse rates and poor overall survival (OS). Chemo-resistant TNBC is a genetically diverse, highly heterogeneous, and rapidly evolving disease that challenges our ability to individualize treatment for incomplete responders and relapsed patients. Currently, the frontline standard chemotherapy, composed of anthracyclines, alkylating agents, and taxanes, is commonly used to treat high-risk and locally advanced TNBC. Several FDA-approved drugs that target programmed cell death protein-1 (Keytruda) and programmed death ligand-1 (Tecentriq), poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), and/or antibody drug conjugates (Trodelvy) have shown promise in improving clinical outcomes for a subset of TNBC. These inhibitors that target key genetic mutations and specific molecular signaling pathways that drive malignant tumor growth have been used as single agents and/or in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens. Here, we review the current TNBC treatment options, unmet clinical needs, and actionable drug targets, including epidermal growth factor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and protein kinase B (PKB or AKT) activation in TNBC. Supported by strong evidence in developmental, evolutionary, and cancer biology, we propose that the K-RAS/SIAH pathway activation is a major tumor driver, and SIAH is a new drug target, a therapy-responsive prognostic biomarker, and a major tumor vulnerability in TNBC. Since persistent K-RAS/SIAH/EGFR pathway activation endows TNBC tumor cells with chemo-resistance, aggressive dissemination, and early relapse, we hope to design an anti-SIAH-centered anti-K-RAS/EGFR targeted therapy as a novel therapeutic strategy to control and eradicate incurable TNBC in the future.",SIAH,-118.44464944649447

There is an absence of specific treatment strategies for this tumor subgroup, and hence TNBC is managed with conventional therapeutics, often leading to systemic relapse. In terms of histology and transcription profile these cancers have similarities to BRCA-1-linked breast cancers, and it is hypothesized that BRCA1 pathway is non-functional in this type of breast cancer. In this review article, we discuss the different receptors expressed by TNBC as well as the diversity of different signaling pathways targeted by TNBC therapeutics, for example, Notch, Hedgehog, Wnt/b-Catenin as well as TGF-beta signaling pathways. Additionally, many epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors effectively inhibit the TNBCs, but they face challenges of either resistance to drugs or relapse. The resistance of TNBC to conventional therapeutic agents has helped in the advancement of advanced TNBC therapeutic approaches including hyperthermia, photodynamic therapy, as well as nanomedicine-based targeted therapeutics of drugs, miRNA, siRNA, and aptamers, which will also be discussed.

New targeted therapies are therefore an urgent unmet medical need for this patient population. Translational and clinical studies into new TNBC treatments have been facilitated by the increased understanding of the aberrant signal transduction pathways regulating growth and survival and the development of chemoresistance in TNBC. Some of the established targeted agents that have been approved in other indications may prove beneficial to patients with TNBC; however, in the absence of approved targeted agents for the treatment of TNBC, most new agents remain experimental. Increased understanding of molecular profiles of TNBC subtypes is likely to improve therapeutic strategies with targeted agents. Novel strategies have reached clinical evaluation in patients with TNBC, including targeting angiogenesis vascular endothelial growth factor and proliferation signalling (receptor tyrosine kinases and mammalian target of rapamycin). Aggressive TNBCs have been found to associate closely with BRCA1 mutation or dysregulation.

: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 15% of all breast cancers and is associated with poor long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. Because of the lack of approved targeted therapy, at present chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for early and advanced disease. TNBC is enriched for germline BRCA mutation, providing a foundation for the use of this as a biomarker to identify patients suitable for treatment with DNA-damaging agents. Inherited and acquired defects in homologous recombination DNA repair, a phenotype termed ""BRCAness,"" may be present in a large proportion of TNBC cases, making it an attractive selection and response biomarker for DNA-damaging therapy. Triple-negative breast cancer is a diverse entity for which additional subclassifications are needed. Increasing understanding of biologic heterogeneity of TNBC has provided insight into identifying potentially effective systemic therapies, including cytotoxic and targeted agents. Numerous experimental approaches are under way, and several encouraging drug classes, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, platinum agents, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase pathway inhibitors, and androgen receptor inhibitors, are being investigated in TNBC. Molecular biomarker-based patient selection in early-phase trials has the potential to accelerate development of effective therapies for this aggressive breast cancer subtype. TNBC is a complex disease, and it is likely that several different targeted approaches will be needed to make meaningful strides in improving the outcomes.

In particular, miR-21, an oncogenic miRNA is a major player involved in tumor initiation, progression, invasion and metastasis in several cancers, including triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, delivery of therapeutic miRNA or anti-miRNA specifically into cancer cells in vivo without collateral damage to healthy cells remains challenging. We report here the application of RNA nanotechnology for specific and efficient delivery of anti-miR-21 to block the growth of TNBC in orthotopic mouse models. The 15 nm therapeutic RNA nanoparticles contains the 58-nucleotide (nt) phi29 pRNA-3WJ as a core, a 8-nt sequence complementary to the seed region of miR-21, and a 39-nt epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting aptamer for internalizing RNA nanoparticles into cancer cells via receptor mediated endocytosis. The RNase resistant and thermodynamically stable RNA nanoparticles remained intact after systemic injection into mice and strongly bound to tumors with little or no accumulation in healthy organs 8 h postinjection, and subsequently repressed tumor growth at low doses. The observed specific cancer targeting and tumor regression is a result of several key attributes of RNA nanoparticles: anionic charge which disallows nonspecific passage across negatively charged cell membrane; “active” targeting using RNA aptamers which increases the homing of RNA nanoparticles to cancer cells; nanoscale size and shape which avoids rapid renal clearance and engulfment by lung macrophages and liver Kupffer cells; favorable biodistribution profiles with little accumulation in healthy organs, which minimizes nonspecific side effects; and favorable pharmacokinetic profiles with extended in vivo half-life. The results demonstrate the clinical potentials of RNA nanotechnology based platform to deliver miRNA based therapeutics for cancer treatment.",anti-miR-21,-137.94464944649445

Transactivating Resistance Resistance to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors in cancer is often mediated by the activation of alternate receptors that provide compensatory signaling. Meyer et al. showed that the RTK AXL predicts resistance to EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) inhibitors in cancer cell lines. Through a ligand-independent mode of transactivation by EGFR, AXL mediated the downstream activation of proteins in a distinct combination, thereby augmenting EGFR signaling and contributing unique output. Diversified, AXL-mediated signaling was required for EGF (epidermal growth factor)–induced migration of TNBC (triple-negative breast cancer) cells. Expression profiles of AXL and EGFR in cancer cell lines predicted resistance to EGFR inhibitors, and treatment with an AXL inhibitor reduced EGFR-elicited proliferation and migration, suggesting that targeting AXL may improve EGFR-targeted drug therapy in TNBC. The relationship between drug resistance, changes in signaling, and emergence of an invasive phenotype is well appreciated, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Using machine learning analysis applied to the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database, we identified expression of AXL, the gene that encodes the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)–associated receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL, as exceptionally predictive of lack of response to ErbB family receptor–targeted inhibitors. Activation of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) transactivated AXL, and this ligand-independent AXL activity diversified EGFR-induced signaling into additional downstream pathways beyond those triggered by EGFR alone. AXL-mediated signaling diversification was required for EGF (epidermal growth factor)–elicited motility responses in AXL-positive TNBC (triple-negative breast cancer) cells. Using cross-linking coimmunoprecipitation assays, we determined that AXL associated with EGFR, other ErbB receptor family members, MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor), and PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor) but not IGF1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) or INSR (insulin receptor). From these AXL interaction data, we predicted AXL-mediated signaling synergy for additional RTKs and validated these predictions in cells. This alternative mechanism of receptor activation limits the use of ligand-blocking therapies and indicates against therapy withdrawal after acquired resistance. Further, subadditive interaction between EGFR- and AXL-targeted inhibitors across all AXL-positive TNBC cell lines may indicate that increased abundance of EGFR is principally a means to transactivation-mediated signaling.",AXL,-149.94464944649445

The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway is frequently activated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The AKT inhibitor capivasertib has shown preclinical activity in TNBC models, and drug sensitivity has been associated with activation of PI3K or AKT and/or deletions of PTEN. The PAKT trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adding capivasertib to paclitaxel as first-line therapy for TNBC.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase II trial recruited women with untreated metastatic TNBC. A total of 140 patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to paclitaxel 90 mg/m2 (days 1, 8, 15) with either capivasertib (400 mg twice daily) or placebo (days 2-5, 9-12, 16-19) every 28 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), PFS and OS in the subgroup with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN alterations, tumor response, and safety.


RESULTS
Median PFS was 5.9 months with capivasertib plus paclitaxel and 4.2 months with placebo plus paclitaxel (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.08; 1-sided P = .06 [predefined significance level, 1-sided P = .10]). Median OS was 19.1 months with capivasertib plus paclitaxel and 12.6 months with placebo plus paclitaxel (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.99; 2-sided P = .04). In patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered tumors (n = 28), median PFS was 9.3 months with capivasertib plus paclitaxel and 3.7 months with placebo plus paclitaxel (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.79; 2-sided P = .01). The most common grade ≥ 3 adverse events in those treated with capivasertib plus paclitaxel versus placebo plus paclitaxel, respectively, were diarrhea (13% v 1%), infection (4% v 1%), neutropenia (3% v 3%), rash (4% v 0%), and fatigue (4% v 0%).


CONCLUSION
Addition of the AKT inhibitor capivasertib to first-line paclitaxel therapy for TNBC resulted in significantly longer PFS and OS. Benefits were more pronounced in patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered tumors. Capivasertib warrants further investigation for treatment of TNBC.",capivasertib,-152.94464944649445

An estimated 1 million cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually worldwide. Of these, more than 170,000 are described as triple-negative. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by the lack of protein expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) and the absence of HER2 protein overexpression. TNBC is a subtype of breast cancer that overlaps with the ""basal-like"" breast cancer. TNBC has significant clinical implications.


METHODS
The epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical course, prognosis, and pathology of this subtype of breast cancer are reviewed. The authors compare the ""triple-negative"" and ""basal-like"" definitions of breast cancer. A discussion of both standard and experimental treatments for TNBC is included.


RESULTS
The poor prognosis of high-grade TNBC relates to poor disease-free interval in the adjuvant setting, shortened progression-free survival in the metastatic setting, and the lack of targeted therapy. However, not all TNBCs are associated with a poor prognosis.


CONCLUSIONS
Although chemotherapy is the main current treatment of this subtype of breast cancer, new agents such as PARP inhibitors, which show promise in the treatment of TNBC, are currently in clinical trials.",PARP,-153.44464944649445

Viruses team up with cancer immunotherapy Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown great promise for cancer therapy, but they do not treat all cancers, and neither breast nor brain tumors are usually treatable with these drugs. However, Bourgeois-Daigneault et al. discovered a way to address this for breast cancer, and Samson et al. discovered a way to address this for brain tumors. In both cases, the authors found that oncolytic virus treatment given early, before surgical resection, alters the antitumor immune response and potentiates the effects of subsequent treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although these studies differ in the details of their methods and the immune effects induced by the oncolytic viruses, they indicate the potential of such viruses for enhancing the potential of checkpoint therapy and expanding it to new types of cancer. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive disease for which treatment options are limited and associated with severe toxicities. Immunotherapeutic approaches like immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a potential strategy, but clinical trials have demonstrated limited success in this patient cohort. Clinical studies using ICIs have revealed that patients with preexisting anticancer immunity are the most responsive. Given that oncolytic viruses (OVs) induce antitumor immunity, we investigated their use as an ICI-sensitizing approach. Using a therapeutic model that mimics the course of treatment for women with newly diagnosed TNBC, we demonstrate that early OV treatment coupled with surgical resection provides long-term benefits. OV therapy sensitizes otherwise refractory TNBC to immune checkpoint blockade, preventing relapse in most of the treated animals. We suggest that OV therapy in combination with immune checkpoint blockade warrants testing as a neoadjuvant treatment option in the window of opportunity between TNBC diagnosis and surgical resection.",Maraba,-158.44464944649445

PARP inhibitors have gained recent attention as rationally designed therapeutics for the treatment of several malignancies, particularly those associated with dysfunctional DNA repair pathways, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We investigated the PARP1 gene expression profile in surgical samples from more than 8,000 primary malignant and normal human tissues. PARP1 expression was found to be significantly increased in several malignant tissues, including those isolated from patients with breast, uterine, lung, ovarian, and skin cancers, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Within breast infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) samples tested, mean PARP1 expression was significantly higher relative to normal breast tissue, with over 30% of IDC samples demonstrating upregulation of PARP1, compared with 2.9% of normal tissues. Because of known DNA repair defects, including BRCA1 dysfunction, associated with TNBC, exploration of PARP1 expression in breast cancers related to expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) led to the observation that negative expression of any of the 3 receptors was associated with upregulation of PARP1 expression, compared with receptor-positive tissues. To validate these observations, an independent set of breast adenocarcinomas was evaluated and demonstrated >2-fold upregulation of PARP1 in approximately 70% of primary breast adenocarcinomas, including TNBC, compared with syngeneic nonmalignant breast tissues. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that upregulation of the PARP1 gene was consistent with increased protein expression in TNBC. These analyses suggest a potential biological role for PARP1 in several distinct malignancies, including TNBC. Further investigation of PARP1 as a biomarker for the therapeutic activity of PARP inhibitor-based therapy is warranted.",PARP1,-159.44464944649445

Although patients initially respond to the treatment, the cancer often comes back and kills the patient. Recent studies have demonstrated that cancer cells express genes that protect them from killing by immune cells, but the stimulus that prompts this response is unknown. We show that when TNBC cells are treated with chemotherapy, the surviving cells turn on genes that enable them to escape killing by the immune system. We identify hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), which are known to promote metastasis of TNBC, as responsible for this countertherapeutic effect. We show that coadministration of an HIF inhibitor with chemotherapy blocks the ability of surviving TNBC cells to evade the immune system. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy and is often characterized by early relapse and metastasis. To form a secondary (recurrent and/or metastatic) tumor, a breast cancer cell must evade the innate and adaptive immune systems. CD47 enables cancer cells to evade killing by macrophages, whereas CD73 and PDL1 mediate independent mechanisms of evasion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Here, we report that treatment of human or murine TNBC cells with carboplatin, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, or paclitaxel induces the coordinate transcriptional induction of CD47, CD73, and PDL1 mRNA and protein expression, leading to a marked increase in the percentage of CD47+CD73+PDL1+ breast cancer cells. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) blocked chemotherapy-induced enrichment of CD47+CD73+PDL1+ TNBC cells, which were also enriched in the absence of chemotherapy by incubation under hypoxic conditions, leading to T cell anergy or death. Treatment of mice with cytotoxic chemotherapy markedly increased the intratumoral ratio of regulatory/effector T cells, an effect that was abrogated by HIF inhibition. Our results delineate an HIF-dependent transcriptional mechanism contributing to TNBC progression and suggest that combining chemotherapy with an HIF inhibitor may prevent countertherapeutic induction of proteins that mediate evasion of innate and adaptive antitumor immunity.",chemotherapy,-160.44464944649445

Of particular concern is triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) which does not respond well to standard hormone therapy and is associated with poor overall patient prognosis. Recent studies indicate that Wnt/β‐catenin signaling is particularly activated in TNBC, such that the Wnt receptor frizzled‐7 (FZD7) and the Wnt co‐receptor LRP6 were found to be up regulated in TNBC. In addition, it has been demonstrated that transcriptional knockdown of LRP6 or FZD7 in TNBC cells suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, salinomycin, a selective breast cancer stem cell killer, was recently demonstrated to be an inhibitor of Wnt/β‐catenin signaling by inducing LRP6 degradation. Therefore, the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway and particularly the Wnt receptors on the cell surface may serve as novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of TNBC. J. Cell.

Here, we report a direct comparative study of ∼90 nm diameter Au nanomatryoshkas (Au/SiO2/Au) and ∼150 nm diameter Au nanoshells for photothermal therapeutic efficacy in highly aggressive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumors in mice. Au nanomatryoshkas are strong light absorbers with 77% absorption efficiency, while the nanoshells are weaker absorbers with only 15% absorption efficiency. After an intravenous injection of Au nanomatryoshkas followed by a single NIR laser dose of 2 W/cm2 for 5 min, 83% of the TNBC tumor-bearing mice appeared healthy and tumor free >60 days later, while only 33% of mice treated with nanoshells survived the same period.

Compared with other breast cancer subtypes, EGFR is frequently overexpressed in TNBC and a potential therapeutic target for this disease. There are two types of EGFR inhibitors, small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and monoclonal antibody (mAb), for the treatment of cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. For breast cancer, however, the clinical trials of EGFR inhibitors have failed due to low response rates. Because a small portion of patients do demonstrate response to EGFR inhibitors, it may be necessary to stratify patients to enhance the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors in TNBC and to develop the effective combination therapy for this patient population.

In the absence of BNip3, mammary tumor cells are unable to reduce mitochondrial mass effectively and elevated mitochondrial ROS increases the expression of Hif‐1α and Hif target genes, including those involved in glycolysis and angiogenesis—two processes that are also markedly increased in BNip3‐null tumors. Glycolysis inhibition attenuates the growth of BNip3‐null tumor cells, revealing an increased dependence on autophagy for survival. We also demonstrate that BNIP3 deletion can be used as a prognostic marker of tumor progression to metastasis in human triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC).

Many studies have shown significant benefit of chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and metastatic treatment of TNBC. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy studies have consistently reported higher response rates in TNBC than non-TNBC, and pathologic complete response has been shown to predict improved long-term outcomes for TNBC. Although the specific adjuvant regimens that may be most effective for TNBC are still being determined, third-generation chemotherapy regimens using dose dense or metronomic polychemotherapy are among the most effective tools presently available. The role of specific chemotherapy agents in the treatment of TNBC remains incompletely defined and warrants careful review to ensure that the most effective therapy is delivered while minimizing unnecessary toxicity. Platinum agents have seen renewed interest in TNBC based on a growing body of preclinical and clinical data suggesting encouraging activity. Taxanes and anthracyclines are active in TNBC and remain important agents but have not shown specific benefit over non-TNBC. Capecitabine has limited reported data in TNBC, but some reports suggest differential activity in TNBC compared with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. TNBC is itself a heterogeneous group in which subgroups such as BRCA1 mutation carriers may have particular sensitivity to platinum agents and relatively less sensitivity to taxanes.

Notably, TNBC tumors respond to retreatment with PU-H71 for several cycles extending for over 5 months without evidence of resistance or toxicity. Through a proteomics approach, we show that multiple oncoproteins involved in tumor proliferation, survival, and invasive potential are in complex with PU-H71-bound Hsp90 in TNBC. PU-H71 induces efficient and sustained downregulation and inactivation, both in vitro and in vivo, of these proteins. Among them, we identify downregulation of components of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway and G2-M phase to contribute to its anti-proliferative effect, degradation of activated Akt and Bcl-xL to induce apoptosis, and inhibition of activated NF-κB, Akt, ERK2, Tyk2, and PKC to reduce TNBC invasive potential.

These tumors have a more aggressive phenotype and a poorer prognosis due to the high propensity for metastatic progression and absence of specific targeted treatments. Patients with TNBC do not benefit from hormonal or trastuzumab-based targeted therapies because of the loss of target receptors. Although these patients respond to chemotherapeutic agents such as taxanes and anthracyclines better than other subtypes of breast cancer, prognosis remains poor. A group of targeted therapies under investigation showed favorable results in TNBC, especially in cancers with BRCA mutation. The lipid-lowering statins (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors), including lovastatin and simvastatin, have been shown to preferentially target TNBC compared with non-TNBC.

Whether BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation status affects treatment outcome remains elusive. Objective To determine whether BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation status affects therapy response in patients with TNBC. Design, Setting, and Participants This secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial used archived DNA samples and cancer family history of 315 patients with TNBC enrolled between August 1, 2011, and December 31, 2012, in the GeparSixto trial. In all, 291 participants (92.4%) were included in this multicenter prospective investigation. DNA samples were analyzed for germline mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, and 16 other cancer predisposition genes. The pCR rates between the carboplatin and noncarboplatin arms were compared. Genetic analyses were performed at the Center for Familial Breast and Ovarian Cancer in Cologne, Germany; data analysis, November 1 through December 31, 2015. Main Outcomes and Measures Proportion of patients who achieved pCR and disease-free survival after neoadjuvant treatment according to BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation status. For pCR rates, the ypT0/is ypN0 definition was used as a primary end point. Results Of the 291 patients with TNBC, all were women; the mean (SD) age was 48 (11) years. The pCR rate in the carboplatin group was 56.8% (83 of 146) and 41.4% (60 of 145) in the noncarboplatin group (odds ratio [OR], 1.87; 95% CI, 1.17-2.97; P = .009). Pathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations were present in 50 of the 291 patients (17.2%). In the noncarboplatin arm, the pCR rate was 66.7% (16 of 24) for patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and 36.4% (44 of 121) for patients without (OR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.39-8.84; P = .008). The high pCR rate observed in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers (16 of 24 [66.7%]) was not increased further by adding carboplatin (17 of 26 [65.4%]). In contrast, carboplatin increased response rates in patients without BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations: 66 of the 120 patients (55%) without BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations achieved pCR in the carboplatin arm vs 44 of the 121 patients (36.4%) in the noncarboplatin arm (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.28-3.58; P = .004). Patients without pathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 alterations showed elevated disease-free survival rates when carboplatin was added (without carboplatin, 73.5%; 95% CI, 64.1%-80.8% vs with carboplatin, 85.3%; 95% CI, 77.0%-90.8%; hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29-0.96; P = .04). Conclusions and Relevance Under the nonstandard GeparSixto polychemotherapy regimen, patients without BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations benefited from the addition of carboplatin and those with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations showed superior response rates without additive effects observed for carboplatin.

To evaluate the risk of locoregional recurrence (LRR) associated with locoregional treatment of women with primary breast cancer tumors negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (triple-negative breast cancer [TNBC]).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients diagnosed with TNBC were identified from a cancer registry in a single institution (n=768). LRR-free survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to determine risk of LRR on the basis of locoregional management: breast-conserving therapy (BCT; ie, lumpectomy and adjuvant radiation therapy [RT]) and modified radical mastectomy (MRM) in the TNBC population and T1-2N0 subgroup.


RESULTS
At a median follow-up of 7.2 years, 77 patients (10%) with TNBC developed LRR. Five-year LRR-free survival was 94%, 85%, and 87% in the BCT, MRM, and MRM + RT groups, respectively (P < .001). In multivariate analysis, MRM (compared with BCT), lymphovascular invasion and lymph node positivity were associated with increased LRR. Conversely, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with decreased risk of LRR. For patients with T1-2N0 tumors, 5-year LRR-free survival was 96% and 90% in the BCT and MRM groups, respectively (P = .027), and MRM was the only independent prognostic factor associated with increased LRR compared with BCT (hazard ratio, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.12 to 5.75; P = .0264).


CONCLUSION
Women with T1-2N0 TNBC treated with MRM without RT have a significant increased risk of LRR compared with those treated with BCT. Prospective studies are warranted to investigate the benefit of adjuvant RT after MRM in TNBC.",radiation,-230.94464944649445

No proven targeted therapy is currently available for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently overexpressed in TNBC. We studied the activity of EGFR antagonists alone, and in combination with chemotherapy, in TNBC cell lines.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
EGFR and phosphorylated EGFR were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors alone and in combination with chemotherapy was assessed. Effects of gefitinib on EGFR signalling and cell cycle were also examined.


RESULTS
EGFR was overexpressed in the TNBC compared with the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)-positive cell lines. Phosphorylation of EGFR was detected in the TNBC cells in response to epidermal growth factor stimulation and was blocked by gefitinib treatment. However, the TNBC cell lines were less sensitive to EGFR inhibition than the HER-2-positive cell lines. Response to gefitinib was associated with reduced phosphorylation of both mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt and induction of G(1) arrest. Gefitinib enhanced response to both carboplatin and docetaxel in the TNBC cells, and the triple combination of gefitinib, carboplatin and docetaxel was synergistic.


CONCLUSIONS
Although the TNBC cells are less sensitive to EGFR inhibition than the HER-2-positive cell lines, gefitinib enhanced response to chemotherapy. Gefitinib combined with carboplatin and docetaxel warrants further investigation in TNBC.",gefitinib,-247.94464944649445

This phase II study evaluated the antitumor activity and safety of enzalutamide in patients with locally advanced or metastatic AR-positive TNBC. Patients and Methods Tumors were tested for AR with an immunohistochemistry assay optimized for breast cancer; nuclear AR staining > 0% was considered positive. Patients received enzalutamide 160 mg once per day until disease progression. The primary end point was clinical benefit rate (CBR) at 16 weeks. Secondary end points included CBR at 24 weeks, progression-free survival, and safety. End points were analyzed in all enrolled patients (the intent-to-treat [ITT] population) and in patients with one or more postbaseline assessment whose tumor expressed ≥ 10% nuclear AR (the evaluable subgroup). Results Of 118 patients enrolled, 78 were evaluable. CBR at 16 weeks was 25% (95% CI, 17% to 33%) in the ITT population and 33% (95% CI, 23% to 45%) in the evaluable subgroup.

There is a need to develop surrogates for treatment efficacy in the neoadjuvant setting to speed-up drug development and stratify patients according to outcome. Preclinical studies showed that chemotherapy induces an antitumor immune response. In order to develop new surrogates for drug efficacy, we assessed the prognostic value of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) on residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Three hundred four TNBC patients with residual disease after NACT were retrospectively identified in three different hospitals. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides from surgical postchemotherapy specimens were evaluated for intratumoral (It-TIL) and stromal (Str-TIL) TIL. Cases were classified as High-TIL if It-TIL and/or Str-TIL >60%.


RESULTS
TIL were assessable for 278 cases. Continuous It-TIL and Str-TIL variables were strong prognostic factors in the multivariate model, both for metastasis-free [hazard ratio (HR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77-0.96, P = 0.01 and HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75-0.98, P = 0.02 for Str-TIL and It-TIL, respectively] and overall survival (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77-0.97, P = 0.01 and HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75-0.99, P = 0.03 for Str-TIL and It-TIL, respectively). The 5-year overall survival rate was 91% (95% CI 68% to 97%) for High-TIL patients (n = 27) and 55% (95% CI 48% to 61%) for Low-TIL patients (HR 0.19, 95% CI 0.06-0.61, log-rank P = 0.0017). The major prognostic impact of TIL was seen for patients with large tumor burden following NACT (residual tumor >2 cm and/or node metastasis). In all but one High-TIL case, It-TIL and Str-TIL values were lower on the prechemotherapy sample.


CONCLUSIONS
The presence of TIL in residual disease after NACT is associated with better prognosis in TNBC patients. This parameter may represent a new surrogate of drug efficacy to test investigational agents in the neoadjuvant setting and a new prognostic marker to select patients at high risk of relapse.",chemotherapy,-286.44464944649445

Patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma frequently develop resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy, at which time treatment options become limited.


Objective
To evaluate the poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor niraparib combined with pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma.


Design, Setting, and Participants
The TOPACIO/KEYNOTE-162 (Niraparib in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Patients With Triple-Negative Breast Cancer or Ovarian Cancer) trial, an open-label, single-arm phases 1 and 2 study enrolled women with advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) or recurrent ovarian carcinoma, irrespective of BRCA mutation status. Median follow-up was 12.4 months (range, 1.2 to ≥23.0 months). Data were collected from April 15, 2016, through September 4, 2018, with September 4, 2018, as a data cutoff, and analyzed from September 4, 2018, through January 30, 2019.


Interventions
The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) was 200 mg of oral niraparib once daily and 200 mg of intravenous pembrolizumab on day 1 of each 21-day cycle.


Main Outcomes and Measures
The primary objectives of phase 1 were to evaluate dose-limiting toxic effects and establish the RP2D and dosing schedule. The primary objective of phase 2 was to assess objective response rate (ORR; complete plus partial responses). Results from the phase 1 ovarian carcinoma and TNBC cohorts and phase 2 ovarian carcinoma cohort are reported. Because of the similarity in the phase 1 and 2 ovarian carcinoma populations, the data were pooled to perform an integrated efficacy analysis.


Results
Fourteen patients (9 with ovarian carcinoma and 5 with TNBC) in phase 1 and 53 patients with ovarian carcinoma in phase 2 were enrolled, for a pooled ovarian carcinoma cohort of 62 patients (median age, 60 years [range, 46-83 years]). In the integrated efficacy phases 1 and 2 ovarian carcinoma population (60 of 62 evaluable patients), ORR was 18% (90% CI, 11%-29%), with a disease control rate of 65% (90% CI, 54%-75%), including 3 (5%) with confirmed complete responses, 8 (13%) with confirmed partial responses, 28 (47%) with stable disease, and 20 (33%) with progressive disease. The ORRs were consistent across subgroups based on platinum-based chemotherapy sensitivity, previous bevacizumab treatment, or tumor BRCA or homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) biomarker status. Median duration of response was not reached (range, 4.2 to ≥14.5 months). At data cutoff, 2 patients with a response and 1 patient with stable disease continued to receive treatment.


Conclusions and Relevance
Niraparib in combination with pembrolizumab is tolerable, with promising antitumor activity for patients with ovarian carcinoma who have limited treatment options regardless of platinum status, biomarker status, or prior treatment with bevacizumab. Responses in patients without tumor BRCA mutations or non-HRD cancers were higher than expected with either agent as monotherapy.

Breast Cancer: Current Molecular Therapeutic Targets and New Players.,"[{'authorId': '3979299', 'name': 'S.

Breast cancer is a complex, heterogeneous disease classified into hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 overexpressing (HER2+) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) based on histological features. Endocrine therapy, the mainstay of treatment for hormone-responsive breast cancer involves use of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), selective estrogen receptor downregulators (SERDs) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs). Agents that target estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2 such as tamoxifen and trastuzumab have been the most extensively used therapeutics for breast cancer. Crosstalk between ER and other signalling networks as well as epigenetic mechanisms have been envisaged to contribute to endocrine therapy resistance. TNBC, a complex, heterogeneous, aggressive form of breast cancer in which the cells do not express ER, progesterone receptor or HER2 is refractory to therapy. Several molecular targets are being explored to target TNBC including androgen receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Receptors, protein tyrosine kinases, phosphatases, proteases, PI3K/Akt signalling pathway, microRNAs (miRs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are potential therapeutic targets. miR-based therapeutic approaches include inhibition of oncomiRs by antisense oligonucleotides, restoration of tumour suppressors using miR mimics, and chemical modification of miRs. The lnRNAs HOTAIR, SPRY4-IT1, GAS5, and PANDAR, new players in tumour development and prognosis may have theranostic applications in breast cancer. Several novel classes of mechanism-based drugs have been designed and synthesised for treatment of breast cancer. Integration of nucleic acid sequencing studies with mass spectrometry-based peptide sequencing and posttranslational modifications as well as rational drug design will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology of breast cancer and help in evolving therapeutic strategies.",tamoxifen,-322.94464944649445

Here, we sought to dissect the mechanisms underlying PARP inhibitor-induced changes in the tumor microenvironment of BRCA1-deficient triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We demonstrate that the PARP inhibitor olaparib induces CD8+ T-cell infiltration and activation in vivo, and that CD8+ T-cell depletion severely compromises antitumor efficacy. Olaparib-induced T-cell recruitment is mediated through activation of the cGAS/STING pathway in tumor cells with paracrine activation of dendritic cells and is more pronounced in HR-deficient compared with HR-proficient TNBC cells and in vivo models. CRISPR-mediated knockout of STING in cancer cells prevents proinflammatory signaling and is sufficient to abolish olaparib-induced T-cell infiltration in vivo. These findings elucidate an additional mechanism of action of PARP inhibitors and provide a rationale for combining PARP inhibition with immunotherapies for the treatment of TNBC. SIGNIFICANCE: This work demonstrates cross-talk between PARP inhibition and the tumor microenvironment related to STING/TBK1/IRF3 pathway activation in cancer cells that governs CD8+ T-cell recruitment and antitumor efficacy.

This is observed despite its usual high sensitivity to chemotherapy. In the advanced setting, responses observed with chemotherapy lack durability. Early-stage clinical studies suggested impressive potential when a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor is given for the treatment of advanced TNBC with BRCA gene dysfunction. The molecular complexity of TNBC has led to proposed subclassifications, which will be of great value for the development of targeted therapies.

In TNBC patients treated with anthracycline-only preoperative chemotherapy, high CD73 gene expression was significantly associated with a lower rate of pathological complete response or the disappearance of invasive tumor at surgery. Using mouse models of breast cancer, we demonstrated that CD73 overexpression in tumor cells conferred chemoresistance to doxorubicin, a commonly used anthracycline, by suppressing adaptive antitumor immune responses via activation of A2A adenosine receptors.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) induces a pathologic complete response (pCR) in approximately 30% of patients with triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). In patients lacking a pCR, NAC selects a subpopulation of chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells. To understand the molecular underpinnings driving treatment-resistant TNBCs, we performed comprehensive molecular analyses on the residual disease of 74 clinically defined TNBCs after NAC, including next-generation sequencing (NGS) on 20 matched pretreatment biopsies. Combined NGS and digital RNA expression analysis identified diverse molecular lesions and pathway activation in drug-resistant tumor cells. Ninety percent of the tumors contained a genetic alteration potentially treatable with a currently available targeted therapy. Thus, profiling residual TNBCs after NAC identifies targetable molecular lesions in the chemotherapy-resistant component of the tumor, which may mirror micrometastases destined to recur clinically. These data can guide biomarker-driven adjuvant studies targeting these micrometastases to improve the outcome of patients with TNBC who do not respond completely to NAC.


SIGNIFICANCE
This study demonstrates the spectrum of genomic alterations present in residual TNBC after NAC. Because TNBCs that do not achieve a CR after NAC are likely to recur as metastatic disease at variable times after surgery, these alterations may guide the selection of targeted therapies immediately after mastectomy before these metastases become evident.",chemotherapy,-344.44464944649445

DNA repair competency is one determinant of sensitivity to certain chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin. Cancer cells with intact DNA repair can avoid the accumulation of genome damage during growth and also can repair platinum-induced DNA damage. We sought genomic signatures indicative of defective DNA repair in cell lines and tumors and correlated these signatures to platinum sensitivity. The number of subchromosomal regions with allelic imbalance extending to the telomere (N(tAI)) predicted cisplatin sensitivity in vitro and pathologic response to preoperative cisplatin treatment in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In serous ovarian cancer treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, higher levels of N(tAI) forecast a better initial response. We found an inverse relationship between BRCA1 expression and N(tAI) in sporadic TNBC and serous ovarian cancers without BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Thus, accumulation of telomeric allelic imbalance is a marker of platinum sensitivity and suggests impaired DNA repair.


SIGNIFICANCE
Mutations in BRCA genes cause defects in DNA repair that predict sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, including platinum; however, some patients without BRCA mutations also benefit from these agents. NtAI, a genomic measure of unfaithfully repaired DNA, may identify cancer patients likely to benefit from treatments targeting defective DNA repair.",cisplatin,-402.44464944649445

We show in TNBC cells that PI3K inhibition leads to DNA damage, downregulation of BRCA1/2, gain in poly-ADP-ribosylation, and subsequent sensitization to PARP inhibition. In TNBC patient-derived primary tumor xenografts, dual PI3K and PARP inhibition with BKM120 and olaparib reduced the growth of tumors displaying BRCA1/2 downregulation following PI3K inhibition. PI3K-mediated BRCA downregulation was accompanied by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. Overexpression of an active form of MEK1 resulted in ERK activation and downregulation of BRCA1, whereas the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 increased BRCA1/2 expression and reversed the effects of MEK1. We subsequently identified that the ETS1 transcription factor was involved in the ERK-dependent BRCA1/2 downregulation and that knockdown of ETS1 led to increased BRCA1/2 expression, limiting the sensitivity to combined BKM120 and olaparib in 3-dimensional culture.


SIGNIFICANCE
Treatment options are limited for patients with TNBCs. PARP inhibitors have clinical activity restricted to a small subgroup of patients with BRCA mutations. Here, we show that PI3K blockade results in HR impairment and sensitization to PARP inhibition in TNBCs without BRCA mutations, providing a rationale to combine PI3K and PARP inhibitors in this indication. Our findings could greatly expand the number of patients with breast cancer that would benefit from therapy with PARP inhibitors. On the basis of our findings, a clinical trial with BKM120 and olaparib is being initiated in patients with TNBCs.",olaparib,-439.44464944649445

The first step in glutamine utilization is its conversion to glutamate by the mitochondrial enzyme glutaminase. CB-839 is a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of both splice variants of glutaminase (KGA and GAC). CB-839 had antiproliferative activity in a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, HCC-1806, that was associated with a marked decrease in glutamine consumption, glutamate production, oxygen consumption, and the steady-state levels of glutathione and several tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. In contrast, no antiproliferative activity was observed in an estrogen receptor–positive cell line, T47D, and only modest effects on glutamine consumption and downstream metabolites were observed. Across a panel of breast cancer cell lines, GAC protein expression and glutaminase activity were elevated in the majority of TNBC cell lines relative to receptor positive cells. Furthermore, the TNBC subtype displayed the greatest sensitivity to CB-839 treatment and this sensitivity was correlated with (i) dependence on extracellular glutamine for growth, (ii) intracellular glutamate and glutamine levels, and (iii) GAC (but not KGA) expression, a potential biomarker for sensitivity. CB-839 displayed significant antitumor activity in two xenograft models: as a single agent in a patient-derived TNBC model and in a basal like HER2+ cell line model, JIMT-1, both as a single agent and in combination with paclitaxel. Together, these data provide a strong rationale for the clinical investigation of CB-839 as a targeted therapeutic in patients with TNBC and other glutamine-dependent tumors.

One third of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) achieve pathologic complete response (pCR) with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). CALGB 40603 (Alliance), a 2 × 2 factorial, open-label, randomized phase II trial, evaluated the impact of adding carboplatin and/or bevacizumab.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients (N = 443) with stage II to III TNBC received paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) once per week (wP) for 12 weeks, followed by doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide once every 2 weeks (ddAC) for four cycles, and were randomly assigned to concurrent carboplatin (area under curve 6) once every 3 weeks for four cycles and/or bevacizumab 10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks for nine cycles. Effects of adding these agents on pCR breast (ypT0/is), pCR breast/axilla (ypT0/isN0), treatment delivery, and toxicities were analyzed.


RESULTS
Patients assigned to either carboplatin or bevacizumab were less likely to complete wP and ddAC without skipped doses, dose modification, or early discontinuation resulting from toxicity. Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were more common with carboplatin, as were hypertension, infection, thromboembolic events, bleeding, and postoperative complications with bevacizumab. Employing one-sided P values, addition of either carboplatin (60% v 44%; P = .0018) or bevacizumab (59% v 48%; P = .0089) significantly increased pCR breast, whereas only carboplatin (54% v 41%; P = .0029) significantly raised pCR breast/axilla. More-than-additive interactions between the two agents could not be demonstrated.


CONCLUSION
In stage II to III TNBC, addition of either carboplatin or bevacizumab to NACT increased pCR rates, but whether this will improve relapse-free or overall survival is unknown. Given results from recently reported adjuvant trials, further investigation of bevacizumab in this setting is unlikely, but the role of carboplatin could be evaluated in definitive studies, ideally limited to biologically defined patient subsets most likely to benefit from this agent.",carboplatin,-711.9446494464945

To date, therapies directed to specific molecular targets have rarely achieved clinically meaningful improvements in outcomes of patients with TNBC, and chemotherapy remains the standard of care. Here, we seek to review the most recent efforts to classify TNBC based on the comprehensive profiling of tumors for cellular composition and molecular features. Technologic advances allow for tumor characterization at ever-increasing depth, generating data that, if integrated with clinical-pathologic features, may help improve risk stratification of patients, guide treatment decisions and surveillance, and help identify new targets for drug development. SIGNIFICANCE: TNBC is characterized by higher rates of relapse, greater metastatic potential, and shorter overall survival compared with other major breast cancer subtypes. The identification of biomarkers that can help guide treatment decisions in TNBC remains a clinically unmet need. Understanding the mechanisms that drive resistance is key to the design of novel therapeutic strategies to help prevent the development of metastatic disease and, ultimately, to improve survival in this patient population.",chemotherapy,-716.9446494464945

PATIENTS AND METHODS Twenty-eight women with stage II or III breast cancers lacking estrogen and progesterone receptors and HER2/Neu (TNBC) were enrolled and treated with four cycles of cisplatin at 75 mg/m(2) every 21 days. After definitive surgery, patients received standard adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy per their treating physicians. Clinical and pathologic treatment response were assessed, and pretreatment tumor samples were evaluated for selected biomarkers. Results Six (22%) of 28 patients achieved pathologic complete responses, including both patients with BRCA1 germline mutations;18 (64%) patients had a clinical complete or partial response. Fourteen (50%) patients showed good pathologic responses (Miller-Payne score of 3, 4, or 5), 10 had minor responses (Miller-Payne score of 1 or 2), and four (14%) progressed. All TNBCs clustered with reference basal-like tumors by hierarchical clustering. Factors associated with good cisplatin response include young age (P = .001), low BRCA1 mRNA expression (P = .03), BRCA1 promoter methylation (P = .04), p53 nonsense or frameshift mutations (P = .01), and a gene expression signature of E2F3 activation (P = .03). CONCLUSION Single-agent cisplatin induced response in a subset of patients with TNBC. Decreased BRCA1 expression may identify subsets of TNBCs that are cisplatin sensitive. Other biomarkers show promise in predicting cisplatin response.",Cisplatin,-837.4446494464945

In this study, we sought to define TNBC subtypes and identify subtype-specific markers and targets. Experimental Design: RNA and DNA profiling analyses were conducted on 198 TNBC tumors [estrogen receptor (ER) negativity defined as Allred scale value ≤ 2] with >50% cellularity (discovery set: n = 84; validation set: n = 114) collected at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX). An external dataset of seven publically accessible TNBC studies was used to confirm results. DNA copy number, disease-free survival (DFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS) were analyzed independently using these datasets. Results: We identified and confirmed four distinct TNBC subtypes: (i) luminal androgen receptor (AR; LAR), (ii) mesenchymal (MES), (iii) basal-like immunosuppressed (BLIS), and (iv) basal-like immune-activated (BLIA). Of these, prognosis is worst for BLIS tumors and best for BLIA tumors for both DFS (log-rank test: P = 0.042 and 0.041, respectively) and DSS (log-rank test: P = 0.039 and 0.029, respectively). DNA copy number analysis produced two major groups (LAR and MES/BLIS/BLIA) and suggested that gene amplification drives gene expression in some cases [FGFR2 (BLIS)]. Putative subtype-specific targets were identified: (i) LAR: androgen receptor and the cell surface mucin MUC1, (ii) MES: growth factor receptors [platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor A; c-Kit], (iii) BLIS: an immunosuppressing molecule (VTCN1), and (iv) BLIA: Stat signal transduction molecules and cytokines. Conclusion: There are four stable TNBC subtypes characterized by the expression of distinct molecular profiles that have distinct prognoses. These studies identify novel subtype-specific targets that can be targeted in the future for the effective treatment of TNBCs. Clin Cancer Res; 21(7); 1688–98. ©2014 AACR.

For permission for commercial use of this work, please see paragraphs 4.2 and 5 of our Terms Abstract: Most breast cancer-related deaths from triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) occur following metastasis of cancer cells and development of tumors at secondary sites. Because TNBCs lack the three receptors targeted by current chemotherapeutic regimens, they are typically treated with extremely aggressive and highly toxic non-targeted treatment strategies. Women with TNBC frequently develop metastatic lesions originating from drug-resistant residual cells and have poor prognosis. For this reason, novel therapeutic strategies that are safer and more effective are sought. Luteolin (LU) is a naturally occurring, non-toxic plant compound that has proven effective against several types of cancer. With this in mind, we conducted in vivo and in vitro studies to determine whether LU might suppress metastasis of TNBC. In an in vivo mouse metastasis model, LU suppressed metastasis of human MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 TNBC cells to the lungs. In in vitro assays, LU inhibited cell migration and viability of MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells. Further, LU induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells. Relatively low levels (10 µM) of LU significantly inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion in MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells, suggesting that it has the ability to suppress a potent angiogenic and cell survival factor. In addition, migration of MDA-MB-231 (4175) LM2 cells was inhibited upon exposure to an antibody against the VEGF receptor, KDR, but not by exposure to a VEGF 165 antibody. Collectively, these data suggest that the anti-metastatic properties of LU may, in part, be due to its ability to block VEGF production and KDR-mediated activity, thereby inhibiting tumor cell migration. These studies suggest that LU deserves further investigation as a potential treatment option for women with TNBC.",Luteolin,

William Audeh'}]",40,,ee2241cd69da8cf7edfb27493905256c5ec22d7d,"Inhibitors of the poly(adenosine triphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 enzyme induce synthetic lethality in cancers with ineffective DNA (DNA) repair or homologous repair deficiency, and have shown promising clinical activity in cancers deficient in DNA repair due to germ-line mutation in BRCA1 and BRCA2. The majority of breast cancers arising in carriers of BRCA1 germ-line mutations, as well as half of those in BRCA2 carriers, are classified as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is a biologically heterogeneous group of breast cancers characterized by the lack of immunohistochemical expression of the ER, PR, or HER2 proteins, and for which the current standard of care in systemic therapy is cytotoxic chemotherapy. Many "" sporadic "" cases of TNBC appear to have indicators of DNA repair dysfunction similar to those in BRCA-mutation carriers, suggesting the possible utility of PARP inhibitors in a subset of TNBC. Significant genetic heterogeneity has been observed within the TNBC cohort, creating challenges for interpretation of prior clinical trial data, and for the design of future clinical trials. Several PARP inhibitors are currently in clinical development in BRCA-mutated breast cancer. The use of PARP inhibitors in TNBC without BRCA mutation will require biomarkers that identify cancers with homologous repair deficiency in order to select patients likely to respond. Beyond mutations in the BRCA genes, dysfunction in other genes that interact with the homologous repair pathway may offer opportunities to induce synthetic lethality when combined with PARP inhibition.",PARP,
